Resumption of the session
Madam President, on a point of order.
Madam President, on a point of order.
We shall call him Mr Hicks.
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.
Why are there no fire instructions?
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?
Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.
We do not know what is happening.
Agenda
Relating to Wednesday:
(Applause from the PSE Group)
Mr HÃ¤nsch represented you on this occasion.
We then put it to a vote.
There was a vote on this matter.
All of the others were of a different opinion.
That was the decision.
There is no such document!
We have agreed to this.
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
It is not a lot to ask.
Thank you very much.
Madam President, has my vote been counted?
My vote was "in favour" .
There is no room for amendments.
Clearly there is a problem here.
Let that be clearly noted and understood.
That did not happen.
This is an important matter.
You did not call me either.
I did not see you asking to speak.
This seems to me to be a workable solution.
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods
I would urge you to endorse this.
I should like to address one final point.
I congratulate him on his excellent report.
This is a pity, in a sense.
In short, the issue is an important one.
The work is done.
All that remains is the business of enforcement.
I would like to mention one final point.
This, however, does not seem feasible.
I should like to make just a few comments.
My third point has also been mentioned already.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Transport of dangerous goods by road
I thought that it was quite superb.
This directive is a contribution to this.
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination
Welcome to Parliament!
Parliament makes demands here that are of central importance.
This brings me to my final point.
We represent the European position.
We cannot wait.
And that will only be the beginning.
The consequences do not inspire hope.
We are badly behind now in this matter.
This latter point is of particular importance.
Unfortunately, this did not happen.
I would like to explain our thinking here.
I urge the House to support these changes.
This is the purpose of these guidelines.
Now to the form.
I find the opposite the case.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
A very important point to my mind.
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.
This attitude appears to me to be unjustified.
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.
What is the result?
We must give them this opportunity.
What is a fair society?
It only remains to put this principle into practice.
So much for the quality.
I agree with your analysis.
Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.
I should like to mention a few specific points.
And finally, there are the cross-border aspects.
This is my first point regarding the policy.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.
I understand what you are saying.
We have taken note of this.
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.
Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this.
Thank you very much.
(The Minutes were approved)
Reform of European competition policy
But the system has hardly changed at all.
It should continue along this path.
Transparency and accountability belong together.
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.
Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.
Subsidies distort allocations, both within and between countries.
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures.
The internal market is the basis for our work.
All this is to the good of the consumer.
One is subsidiarity.
Thank you very much, Mr Radwan.
The market favours the short term and immediate profits.
In order to function, the market needs rules.
We want a true culture of competition in Europe.
Should we not be discussing this issue?
When will we debate that?
Having said that, governing means planning.
Vulnerable people find themselves hardest hit.
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future.
They are still in training, as it were.
For this reason, modernisation was essential.
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary.
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.
Various arguments have been presented in its favour.
So, judicially, something needs to be done.
It is important that business has legal certainty.
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently.
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision.
Society is surrendering itself to the economy.
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage.
But opinion differs as to the solution.
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.
This is unacceptable to my mind.
This is unacceptable in my view.
It would weaken a key element of European policy.
There was no majority for this at the time.
I consider this to be unacceptable.
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines.
I agree with this request.
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues.
With what aim?
Not to save jobs.
Did these firms need state aid to survive?
The form the aid takes is important.
But Europe is changing.
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy.
This is not in question.
Uniformity needs to be worked on.
What is the Commissioner' s opinion of this?
But we all want to be oarsmen on it.
We all agree on this.
There have only been nine rejections.
This is therefore an aspect to be considered.
Here improvements should be made.
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation.
Many speakers have underlined this.
Why?
Is this simply a political gesture?
No.
The fourth group is legal certainty.
The first is greater transparency.
I am especially grateful for all of this.
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Protection under criminal law of the Union's financial interests
After five years only four have done so.
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings.
The Treaty is a collection of complex articles.
But be careful.
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.
It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is.
We need to do something about it.
We need to take this responsibility seriously.
The question is: who prosecutes?
That is where we really get into difficulty.
We are aware that it is a delicate debate.
But the Member States failed to cooperate.
Yet, every year we have the same problem.
It is fine, in principle.
It need only be fine-tuned.
And indeed there is a twofold shift.
I do not believe so.
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime.
And what exactly should be done?
So, unification in this small area.
It is, in fact, something very positive.
Just like Europol.
Parliament supports this.
The Committee of Wise Men supports this.
We need a public debate on this.
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law.
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2.
We also face difficulties with regard to offences.
Nothing has changed there.
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged.
To remedy this, vigorous efforts are required.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
VOTE
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).
These are both about voting.
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris.
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure.
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
Procedure without debate:
(Parliament approved the legislative resolution)
The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources
.
There is as yet no federal European tax.
Koch Report (A5-0105/1999)
Parliament voted in favour of this text.
Koch Report (A5-0104/1999)
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)
.
.
.
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)
.
.
The poorest regions are gradually making good their underdevelopment.
In 1996 it was 50%.
Progress is particularly marked in Portugal and Ireland.
von Wogau Report (A5-0069/1999)
.
.
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999)
This is repulsive most of all in social terms.
.
That is why we are voting against this report.
Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999)
Langen Report (A5-0073/1999)
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002.
Oil slick off the French coast
I will not do so.
This legislation is still recent.
What are the conditions for this recognition?
What guarantees are there of its reliability?
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission.
We await the outcome with great interest.
Why not?
The time for resolutions has passed.
What is now needed is action.
I can testify to this remarkable work.
This is no longer tolerable.
Next, we have flags of convenience.
This is no longer tolerable.
Finally, there is the lack of transparency.
This is no longer tolerable.
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.
It is now scheduled for July.
This must be brought forward.
And now the Erika.
Whose turn is next?
And this is the result.
They are the result of human thoughtlessness.
What we have here is an ecological disaster.
We know what actually happened.
The 15 clearly do not suffice.
Many thanks for this.
So this 25% should be increased.
But this is not in place.
So what are we to do now?
What are we to do now?
Of course, we need double-hulled vessels.
So what do we need to happen immediately?
This is what we need for ships.
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.
We must also critically examine the classification societies.
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.
However, we must stick to the facts.
I cannot accept this.
There are reputable companies too.
It could have sunk anywhere.
By now they are far away.
It is a miracle that they were saved.
Things could well continue in the same way.
Where are the Erika' s owners?
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection.
On the other hand, prevention is essential.
That should be the starting point for our efforts.
The Erika catastrophe comes as no surprise.
Control is the key word here.
So why is there no black list?
In this area we must respond to public opinion.
States can carry out port inspections.
In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right.
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored?
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen?
RINA is currently the talk of the town.
Malta is entering the accession negotiations.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage.
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.
The victims are waiting outside.
They want answers.
Who will provide us with new jobs?
But there is an art to that as well.
The issue is as topical as it was before.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.
That is the reality.
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.
We already have legislation.
I will end now.
I will not expand further.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We have taken good note of your intentions.
The debate is closed.
Storms in Europe
I have seen this myself.
Economic activities have been brought to a halt.
The consequences of this have been immediate.
Some foresters have lost everything.
How so?
Why is this not an exceptional matter?
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.
Let me explain.
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens.
I can show you a copy if you wish.
That, however, is another problem altogether.
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity.
This programme must work at full capacity.
Current programmes must be accelerated.
However, it has now achieved notoriety.
All this is well-intentioned advice.
This is wrong!
And no one can comprehend this attitude.
I say they have a right to solidarity.
Permit me one further comment.
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream.
This is an irreparable loss.
That is important.
It was very small.
I think we should reinstate this budget line.
The calculations are in decades rather than years.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Natural habitats were destroyed.
I want to discharge my responsibilities seriously.
You know this budget.
This money is available now, this year.
I say this with great humility.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday.
Food safety
Over 80 measures are envisaged.
The first key concern is independence.
We must also ensure excellence and transparency.
I also reject this line of argument.
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving.
This is a major task.
It is essential that we get the mix right.
That is very much the right approach.
I hope that we can thrash this out.
That is the one word I am talking about.
That cannot continue.
You are unclear about this in your White Paper.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.
I also welcome the White Paper.
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice.
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.
There may be a number of views on that.
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.
It must be visible.
It must be known.
It must be visible.
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence.
The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different.
That is my judgement at the moment.
That concludes the debate.
Question Time (Commission)
We will examine questions to the Commission.
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion.
First Part
Question No 28 by (H-0781/99):
Thank you for your reply.
So much for the political aspect.
Now to the technical aspect.
I have explained the position of the Commission.
In the case of Turkey it is different.
The plant is not yet there.
I do not have these concerns.
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99):
If not, why not?
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question.
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question.
That is also mentioned in the report.
I cannot answer that question.
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99):
I urge the Chinese again to do so.
The Commission, like others, has urged dialogue.
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):
Are these reports accurate?
The newspaper reports were misleading.
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy.
I am sorry.
I wish you a good evening.
Second Part
Question No 33 by (H-0829/99):
Is the Commission prepared to take such measures?
That is naturally unacceptable.
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.
Question No 34 by (H-0831/99):
Questions to Mrs Diamantopoulou
This is not the usual state of affairs.
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):
Thank you, Commissioner for your reply.
Did anyone find work?
How many people found work?
What has been done about training?
Do we have any figures?
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):
I think that the answer is brief and clear.
Of course it is as you say.
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):
Which Commissioners are members of this group?
What concrete measures have been discussed?
This question covers several individual matters.
Allow me to say just one word.
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace.
This is an important aspect of this initiative.
The last question concerns the amount granted.
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million.
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission.
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.
In other words, it is positive discrimination.
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99):
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99):
Firstly, I agree with you entirely.
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):
It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.
We congratulate you.
That concludes Question Time.
1997 discharge
This has now been done.
This is in place too.
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges.
It did this as well.
We want more than that, however.
I would quote Gaza as an example.
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.
But we need that reform process.
It groups them together and that is very important.
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe.
We have to get this right.
We have to remedy that.
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.
What improvements have there been?
What is there to justify granting the discharge today?
These are also positive signs.
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge.
The other issue is access to confidential documents.
We have put down an amendment to that effect.
The situation there is totally unacceptable.
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan.
It is about a Commission which is no more.
There is now a new Commission.
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts.
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month.
They look good in themselves.
The previous speaker already said something about this.
This also applies to whistle-blowers.
Clear progress must be visible.
In that year, we voted against granting discharge.
That is just the way things are, however.
Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work.
The report is very ambitious.
The Commission shares the rapporteur' s ambitious approach.
You emphasised the global approach in your report.
This global approach is part of the reform package.
We briefly discussed OLAF this morning.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts
The number of departments has been reduced.
Urgent change is required today.
A number of codes have since been introduced.
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.
They must be implemented without delay.
This communication must contain a clear timetable.
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism.
Have the lessons not been learnt?
It is an excellent report.
That is important.
I will give you one example of this.
It is clear that is not acceptable.
Our own staff policy is outdated.
Some of our working practices need radical reform.
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting.
European taxpayers need to be re-assured.
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.
Is this possible?
It is his first report here in plenary.
Let us be honest.
We are now four months down the line.
I would like to end on the following point.
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.
We fully support all these recommendations.
I would like to make some observations, however.
How should we deal with this?
Also, Parliament should take up the gauntlet.
Allow me to start with the most important demand.
We do not want financial control to be abolished.
Firstly, there is the Commissioners' individual responsibility.
This must be regulated during the IGC.
It now appears that this desire is more serious.
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise.
Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.
A single key is to suffice in future.
However, the financial controllers must work independently.
Therefore, independence is prerequisite for effective checks.
There is no backbone, and no teeth.
Where is the beef?
Romano Prodi promised a revolution.
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances.
Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool.
This report is about the Commission.
Parliament is a separate subject.
Most of the report is about financial control.
We should get it into perspective.
It is important to remember that.
They have very little of it.
They have a much wider responsibility.
But we need radical reform.
The Financial Regulation should be amended.
It is just a question of how.
We should be careful about this.
Instead, we should be reforming and decentralising control.
The Commission does not have enough staff.
The staffing system is too rigid.
Perhaps this is a little worrying.
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.
These are what are missing.
We do not hunt down criminals.
That is OLAF' s job.
A very important proposal indeed.
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.
Finally, the issue of officials.
For example, we are currently looking into TAOs.
It is the responsibility of this Parliament.
'Long-winded' .
It is also 'confusing' .
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.
Securing this is a major priority.
We must win back their faith in EU politics.
Hence the transmission.
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.
Change in the law is fundamental.
That service will open on 1 May this year.
We are seeking to implement best practice.
A communication later this year will give full details.
That is in line with the draft resolution.
I welcome Parliament's support for that.
That is most certainly relevant.
Parliament has frequently made that point.
They are already having implications for resource availability.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
Middle East peace process (continuation)
Such is life.
Nor is our role confined to that of banker.
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts.
I want to underline that point.
I hope the House will understand that.
Mr President, Commissioner Patten has our understanding.
I want to emphasise four points.
The second point relates to Syria.
There, the border question is obviously central.
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State.
The moment of truth is approaching.
We cannot be content with a role backstage.
What can the European Union do in these circumstances?
Unfortunately, very little.
I consider this to be very encouraging news.
That would be a similar situation.
We really hope and believe so.
Never have the parties been so determined.
Area of Freedom, Security and Justice
The same is true with regard to immigration policy.
(Applause)
We will do this today.
Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ also mentioned an interinstitutional agreement.
(Sustained applause)
I find this question more and more worrying.
Scoreboard sounds like skateboard in German.
The first is asylum.
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years.
I hope that it works out.
Numerous questions are still outstanding.
Answers are still awaited.
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force.
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC.
Parliament has amended the contractual text.
They were treated like the worst criminals.
The laws against racism must be harmonised.
The level of racism in our society is terrifying.
Racism in Ireland is endemic.
Any democrat can spot two key problems.
Now, it is the soul.
In 1998, we had 55 murders.
I would like to make three brief points.
Let us stop the shadow-boxing.
However, the main concern remains ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
I thank them for their statements to the House.
I refer to Eurodac.
Neither will it stop raising vital issues.
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency.
But I want to add a word of caution.
But we must look always to subsidiarity.
Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency.
(Sustained applause)
Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable.
Question Time (Council)
We will examine questions to the Council.
Question No 1 by (H-0780/99):
Thank you for your answer.
My second point concerns the safety of these plants.
The matter is still open.
This is not true.
Question No 5 by (H-0785/99):
I understand that Portugal is affected by this.
Question No 6 by (H-0788/99):
We have endeavoured to provide material help.
There are two fundamental questions in particular.
Question No 8 by (H-0796/99):
However, housing is specifically excluded.
Question No 9 by (H-0798/99):
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
Question No 12 by (H-0801/99):
Why should we do this?
But there are some questions still outstanding.
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this?
I appreciate that it is a provocative question.
Can you?
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion.
I would ask him to be brief.
That concludes questions to the Council.
Capital tax
The next item is the joint debate on:
This has also just been underlined by Mr DÃ©sir.
Secondly, speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify.
We need stronger banking supervision.
We need to clarify the liability for transactions.
We need a framework of regulations at international level.
I refer to point 9.
In itself, globalisation is positive.
There should be no confusion in this debate.
This argument is therefore not relevant.
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing.
I am disappointed in the EPP.
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind.
The Members on the right should note this.
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable.
There must be an overriding economic interest.
We are looking for solutions.
To continue would be economic suicide.
The danger is too great for us to ignore.
We all know that!
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush!
We have asset inflation of global proportions.
That too is feasible.
I think that he is correct in this regard.
This indicates how difficult these dossiers are.
I think that this will be problematic.
That is not always the case.
Monsieur Bolkestein, je veux vous dire quelque chose!
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid.
Thank you, Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez.
We had heard about this regrettable incident.
(The Minutes were approved)
Resumption of the session
Mrs Angelilli, thank you.
I have taken note of your comment.
Agenda
The next item is the order of business.
This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent.
(Applause)
If you ratify ...
Madam President, I thought I had three minutes.
Do forgive me.
(Parliament gave its assent)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Talks in Austria on forming a government
Let me remind you of what this statement said.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Sustained applause)
These are the foundations of the Union.
(Applause)
We categorically reject the things he has said.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause from the PPE-DE Group)
I will say one thing.
A government must have more nerve and more courage.
(Applause)
We should not be so politically partisan.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
That is deeply disturbing.
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
(Applause)
It was both pertinent and politically intelligent.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
However, we already knew this.
And these are the consequences!
(The President cut the speaker off)
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti!
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Applause)
(Applause, heckling)
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Please support the Austrian people against this government!
(Applause)
We know that most Austrians respect these values.
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy.
We are talking about us, not Austria.
However, that is not the problem.
Our answer to this crucial question is no.
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
Let us learn the lessons of the past.
So our response must be rapid and strong.
We must therefore find a political solution.
Our response must be rapid.
That should be our task, not political posturing.
Something has happened.
And this is not pure chance.
Well, we cannot accept such statements.
(Applause)
Because what is it that unites us in Europe?
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness.
He is a dangerous man.
Values should take precedence over power.
In fact, we were shaken by it.
We are extremely disappointed.
Madam President, Austria awaits a heavy responsibility.
Who would want this to happen?
Europe is a community of law.
(Applause)
That surely is in everyone' s interests.
That is our duty.
It is also a matter of conviction.
My final point is this.
We understand the context of this essential debate.
Does the Commission support the Council?
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Recourse to the precautionary principle
The precautionary principle is not a new concept.
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear.
The basic aim of the communication is twofold.
It is therefore political by nature.
All these elements have to apply cumulatively.
.
How would you describe this?
What establishes a recognised minority?
The Commission?
The Council?
What is the role of the scientific committees?
These are my three questions.
.
Yes, Mr President, that is true.
Well, that depends on who the legislators are.
This is part of risk management.
It is about brominated flame retardants.
.
This issue is extremely topical.
.
Mr President, I have two questions.
I shall try to be very brief indeed.
Instead, the precautionary principle should come first.
My second question concerns the burden of proof.
.
(SV) Thank you, Mrs SchÃ¶rling.
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof.
It is therefore a teratogenic substance.
So I want to put this question to you.
.
I believe we can learn something from this.
I have good reason for asking this.
This constitutes a good example, therefore.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Intergovernmental Conference
The Member States are apparently open to this possibility.
I am not seeking to be a scribe.
In theory, we could have done so.
That it is what we are doing.
We will talk about this on another day.
They need a political deal.
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree.
There is time.
It lasted only five months.
That is all to the good.
That is why we need transparency.
It is all about creating a socially just Europe.
There is clearly a more ambitious goal.
Brussels knows best.
It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian.
It is therefore ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
There is more to be said on that score.
This is the crux of the matter.
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
What is the Commission' s verdict on this?
It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation.
This is untenable.
However, that is precisely what is happening.
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully.
I will mention two point that may create tension.
The other area of conflict is more difficult.
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist.
I am, however, optimistic.
It will become totally invisible!
The constitutional framework has now been clarified.
My second question is for Commissioner Barnier.
It relates to the Commission' s initiative.
It has been said many times.
This time, however, it is true.
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform?
That puts enlargement in danger.
Must there be an IGC?
The agenda must go much further.
We must clearly set firm objectives.
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point.
Have we achieved results?
However, these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared.
Tomorrow, I shall be in London.
It will have to initiate these negotiations.
Cross-border services
That is why he deserves special mention!
.
I propose to confine my comments to two areas.
Alternatively, I might have no directive at all.
Neither outcome would be satisfactory.
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution.
Nevertheless, I have tabled an amendment.
Legal security requires this.
Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations?
The other amendments are unacceptable.
I will keep myself free in this connection.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Court of First Instance
II.
The first concerns this Parliament.
The European Union is a system based on law.
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible.
The unease is justified.
The Commission sympathises with these considerations.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo
I propose that we start the debate immediately.
We have been asked for EUR 35 million.
We are talking about macrofinancial aid.
This is not our opinion.
The other parties are not paying.
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments.
Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors.
That is excellent news!
I believe that is a good thing
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything.
What is to be done with this money?
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated.
.
This is simply a political commitment.
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature.
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual.
Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.
I agree, absolutely.
We shall do so.
The debate is closed.
ALTENER
The project has been long and problematic.
One example is the use of peat.
This is the European Union' s declared aim.
One last word regarding the programme.
.
SAVE
This was an important consideration for us.
It is something that we can all support.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
CULTURE 2000
What kind of horse-trading system is this?
Certainly not a fair one!
It is downright scandalous what goes on!
Congratulations!
It is also of great importance to citizens.
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand.
They are like a snake biting its own tail.
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas.
It is shameful!
Both of them have done a first-class job.
Why do I say that culture is important?
However, it is not under threat from Europe.
That is what Culture 2000 is about.
Are we doing enough?
Cultural activity creates identity.
We want a colourful Europe.
There is a blatant discrepancy here!
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out.
That is what Culture 2000 represents.
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.
Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)
End-of-life vehicles
We therefore have a number of amendments.
This is my main concern in this matter.
What should we do with the shredded products?
We think they should.
May I say something about costs.
I can only warn you against consenting to this.
This too is a particular desire of my group.
This means that we need a pressure instrument.
There are a number of sound amendments.
I ask for your support.
The taxpayer is still footing the bill.
Neither is correct.
It concerns the issue of recycling costs.
Let us look at an example.
Firstly, because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives.
This is also an important point.
Is this too much of a burden?
Quite the reverse, in fact.
This directive encourages the whole of this sector.
That is a basic principle which we must uphold.
I think we need to retain it.
I would ask you to support this common position.
The common position stipulates 2006.
This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer.
The polluter should pay.
There must be rules governing existing vehicles too.
This in itself generates a large amount of waste.
Cars are also part of our cultural heritage.
I think we would all agree on that.
This is totally unacceptable.
Do not continue in this vein!
It is high time that we reached an agreement.
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.
The other question is who should bear the cost.
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities.
I am opposed to making the car owners liable.
Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle?
This means that we move away from shredding.
That was not easy.
I would like to comment on two things.
Firstly, vintage cars and motorbikes.
These should indeed be excluded from the directive.
These costs are not very high.
Now who should pay the costs?
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers!
It has become eminently political.
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate.
We cannot accept this.
It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable.
Most of the technical issues have been resolved.
We have arrived at the final question.
That is quite simply: Who pays?
That is not unreasonable.
They have paid already.
I cannot accept that.
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer.
The common position is a reasonable compromise.
Mr President, this is an extremely bad directive.
It is like so much European legislation.
It is far too prescriptive.
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling.
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach.
This is a big problem in my opinion.
They would then determine their own prices.
Should this be condemned ecologically, Frau Breyer?
I do not think so.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
I think we have tabled a sound proposal.
I am in favour of collection free of charge.
It worked for us.
Why would it not work elsewhere?
The present directive has three aims.
Instead, we should avoid creating so much waste.
Two important questions have arisen in this regard.
First of all: who should pay?
No.
No, of course not.
It is quite the opposite.
The costs will not disappear.
Nor will the waste disappear.
It is still not an insurmountable problem.
We can deal with it.
We already have an infrastructure.
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled.
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety.
These amendments can all be approved.
They cannot therefore be approved.
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers.
Far from it.
This is not covered by the directive.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
It should not be in the amendment.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament approved the joint text)
(Parliament approved the joint text)

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
McNally Report (A5-0082/1999)
This objective deserves our total support.
It is not a quota!
People must realise this!
These splendid cars do not constitute waste.
This should not in any way be jeopardised.
That would not be fulfilling our mission.
.
The directive remains in place.
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000)
Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000):
So what was done at Amsterdam?
In that respect, nothing.
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report (A5-0018/2000)
.
If they yield, they are lost.
.
.
This is why I am voting against the report.
the number and responsibilities of Commissioners
weighting of votes in the Council
Joint resolution on Austria
Is this hysteria spontaneous?
Underground networks?
(The President cut the speaker off)
I really think that people should be extremely cautious.
This is not the way to fight extremism.
This needs to be said!
They are wrong.
Leopards do not change their spots.
I am proud to support such a resolution.
They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÃ.
On the contrary, they will strengthen them.
.
The European Parliament was the first to speak up.
Fascism and neo-Nazism are cancers!
The foul monster has been reawakened!
Such a concern is misplaced.
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism.
It has no right to do so.
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider.
Austria is a free, independent and sovereign country.
Nothing of this nature has yet occurred in Austria.
I urge the Commission to be less cautious.
In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities.
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution.
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Thank you, Mr Davies.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Happy Valentine' s Day!
Thank you, Mr Murphy.
Madam President, on a point of order.
They will look into the matter thoroughly.
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.
This was just a procedural motion.
It is now February and we are still waiting.
Agenda
President.
(Parliament gave its assent)Relating to Thursday:
President.
We can therefore table only one additional item.
(Parliament gave its assent) President.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
President.
(Parliament rejected the proposal) President.
(Parliament gave its assent) President.
We have tried to drive this proposal through.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Relating to Friday: President.
We already have a directive.
(Parliament gave its assent)
That is absolutely absurd.
This sounds perfectly feasible.
I understand that there is agreement on this issue.
These are serious allegations.
We are taking legal advice.
My colleagues' register of interests is complete.
Quite, we agree absolutely.
Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative
.
Nevertheless, technical assistance is necessary.
It should prevent society from splintering.
The Community initiative means community involvement.
.
.
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee.
The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments.
Nothing has happened!
That is a question of solidarity and progress.
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence.
We would then be overreaching ourselves.
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase.
Five months are provided for this.
That seems to me to be rather too long.
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.
How will these people be selected?
Projects should also specifically address this problem.
Thank you, Mr President.
This is not very good at all.
I urge you to look seriously at this problem.
This is an arduous task.
This is not the case!
It has to be redistributed time and again.
I believe that this is actually a good thing.
The investment needs to be visionary.
That time is now past.
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation.
I hope for their adoption.
My group will not be supporting those amendments.
Unfortunately, developments are not moving in that direction.
On the contrary.
One can only hope that it succeeds.
Of course this is also the basic idea.
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22.
I believe that we should be pleased about this.
Its argument was one of priority.
Finally, a word on INTERREG.
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria!
There is an immense risk of exclusion.
How are priorities supposed to be set here?
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments.
I would urge Parliament to support them.
I would consequently like to highlight three issues:
.
I can understand your concern.
That is my initial response to the threshold question.
I agree completely.
So much for the first comment.
The Commission must continue along these lines.
I am making a personal commitment to do so.
I now come to the content of the report.
I can only fully share your concern.
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled.
Firstly, the enlargement of the thematic areas.
The second subject is flexibility and simplification.
Finally, I would like to mention technical assistance.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
(The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation.
Absolutely, Mr Napolitano.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest.
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane.
I did not hide behind any immunity.
I took the punishment that came to me.
Mrs Lucas should do the same.
(Parliament approved the request)
Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification.
They have our full support.
(Applause)
Agenda
(Parliament gave its assent)
Commission's strategic objectives and legislative programme
We must increase our efficiency in this area.
We must reopen the Danube to boats.
Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more.
We in the European Union are one Community.
We belong together, even when there are problems.
(Applause)
We need structural reforms in the European economy.
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity.
We support that.
In this respect we wish you every success.
(Applause)
This is not entirely President Prodi' s fault.
We are recovering from a crisis.
There can be no democracy without a living parliament.
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity.
They are political because we are moving on.
The challenge of enlargement is political.
Because it is political it is more complex.
Because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive.
We need more explanation of what Europe is about.
We need to open that debate.
That is the way it should be.
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference.
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation.
Do please try to make the international organisations democratic.
We can submit motions for this together with you.
This must be one of our absolute priorities.
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion.
My second criticism follows on from the first.
My third criticism stems from the first two.
But all is not lost.
I support the enlargement of the European Union.
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation.
Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs.
We need to match this vision with reality.
Firstly, we need a successful European economy.
That does not apply to Austria alone.
The Commission should react quickly in this respect.
We must move faster.
Perhaps you can correct me on this.
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation.
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic.
So who is this then?
We could not agree more with the latter.
The document mentions common values on different occasions.
Take the Telecom sector, for example.
Have you already included your second term of office?
But seriously.
First, streamlining.
(Applause)
That is transparency.
(Applause)
(Applause)
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice.
This is what the Commission will be judged on.
This is not impossible.
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this.
It is all of you.
Tell the truth for once.
The salvation of European democracies is with nation states.
(Limited applause)
What other explanation could there be for omitting women?
The EU must not take on a masculine persona.
This event must underpin enlargement.
This is one of the goals of your reform.
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity.
I will therefore judge you on your deeds.
However, I must make two essential points.
These concern the simplification and application of Community law.
I welcome you and your ambition.
Not a euro more or a euro less.
You should ask the Council.
These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre.
The ingredients of this policy are well known.
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy.
And do you know why?
Let me give you three examples.
The same applies to European air traffic control.
You still have not finished that agenda.
I do not necessarily mean financial resources.
There must also be savings.
It is not easy to combine those aims.
There is no obvious way.
That foundation is clearly the single market.
This is the Commission' s own survey.
A paper this short is a farce.
We want instruments to prevent abuse.
The Commission gives no soul to Europe.
Just a few main points.
Declarations of principle are not enough.
There is nothing new in your work programme.
Does that give me hope for the year 2000?
No, it does not!
No, you have not done so.
You have not integrated it anywhere.
.
They want to see results.
These are really the people who deserve our solidarity.
Certainly not!
You may draw your own conclusions.
That is something we must guard against.
This has since been unanimously approved.
I hope that this is a misunderstanding.
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.
.
It has been a constructive debate for Europe.
The Commission wants globalisation.
This is the cornerstone of the programme.
The Commission must become a driving force.
Well of course it does!
I welcome this broad unity over enlargement.
But enlargement is also about being strict.
These countries understood that we have helped their transformation.
But this is Europe.
Why the sacrifice?
Africa is principally one of our problems.
I am encouraged by this.
We are ready to collaborate.
You said that the honeymoon is over.
I think that we must avoid this danger.
Welcome
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn.
Without them we would not be able to function.
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.
We shall now proceed to the vote.1
VOTE
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Berthu (UEN).
This has become a real obsession.
It is clear what this means.
You can imagine what would come of this.
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13.
.
McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000)
Disparate actions are not effective.
They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs.
.
.
We can therefore welcome its adoption.
This represents a drop of 30%!
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low.
It also reduces appropriations by 30%.
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency.
DecourriÃ¨re report (A5-0028/2000)
Why am I stressing this point?
The challenges are therefore immense.
The maritime world has great potential.
.
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition.
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme.
.
Procacci report (A5-0025/2000)
2 020 million.
Thank you for your attention.
Without agriculture, the rural world will disappear.
The rapporteur' s phrasing was therefore too limiting.
Additives in feedingstuffs
People are especially wary of GMOs.
However, before labelling we need clear rules.
However, more work is needed on this.
A coherent legal framework must be re-established.
Allow me to comment briefly on two other points.
First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs.
We must strike a balance between them.
GMOs are the new challenge facing us.
.
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament.
It is before Parliament for second reading.
Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this.
So this issue will be addressed.
For example, you did not go into antibiotics.
We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years.
I look forward to the next round.
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Parliament has taken due note of your comments.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Scrapie
We insist on this.
I should also like to address two other points.
And it is still on the agenda today.
The cast is always the same.
How will BSE status in fact be defined then?
What about the BSE test?
When will you make it compulsory?
We have a new Commission.
Important issues cannot be regulated in annexes.
They belong in the legislative text.
The disease is always fatal.
It is indeed.
BSE has certainly not gone away.
You can see it in different countries.
It will be there for some time to come.
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Community policy in the field of water
Many directives have already been adopted.
Yet we do not have much time.
I hope they will be supported by this House.
The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative.
One example is water transfers.
This brings home the connections which bind us together.
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad.
There are many opportunities to hide.
This is something that they prefer to avoid doing.
The principle also concerns water charging.
I want to refer to the political position here.
It is a retrograde step.
We have seen vote after vote lost.
We have failed to achieve a qualified majority.
We need to get into that conciliation position.
The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak.
Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable.
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource.
We are not, fortunately, at this point.
The water issue will definitely not be settled today.
And we can already see the consequences!
Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident.
Coordination is the key word here.
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical.
It is time for action.
This Forum stands for a worldwide vision.
The time for action is upon us.
The common position is not ambitious enough.
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up.
First OSPAR.
Let us grab our chance.
I understand this.
There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers.
We cannot afford to wait.
Secondly, there is compulsory cooperation.
Compare it with what happens in December.
You have to admit: this is a joke.
I would like to finish off with this observation.
We need to change tack completely.
This can only benefit our credibility.
The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform
We want to encourage debate among the people.
So this is what we are going to do.
Colleagues, you know the rules.
Thank you, Mr Napolitano.
Its first meeting should take place in March.
Will you confirm what is the case?
Finally, this is why we have public debate.
I have two questions.
My second question is of a critical nature.
These are the modern means to be used.
I have evidence that this is possible.
Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments.
I willingly accept your invitation.
I can perform this dual task.
I have already appeared before the French Senate.
I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue.
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels?
I do not think so.
This will therefore be our rule.
Our proposal is not general or systematic.
This has never been the case.
Everything which can be done will be useful.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
Question Time (Commission)
We will examine questions to the Commission.
First part
Question No 36 by (H-0025/00):
We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo.
Are you aware of this?
Are you prepared to act upon it?
This is my first additional question.
Question No 37 by (H-0029/00):
That statement could not be much clearer.
Question No 38 by (H-0040/00):
I have a related point.
Question No 39 by (H-0036/00):
Will it cover immigrants etc.?)
I understand your concern about the rights of children.
There is no contradiction between the two.
Question No 40 by (H-0095/00):
The Commission is not a State.
Could the Commissioner answer two questions.
Firstly he talked about verification.
We are not talking about words here.
The honourable Member raised the question.
Second part
Questions to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m
Question No 41 by (H-0021/00):
Thank you for the follow-up question.
Question No 42 by (H-0026/00):
Thank you for your reply.
This is a crucial goal.
.
I hope that this will be of benefit.
Question No 43 by (H-0045/00):
An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out.
You say there will be no further funding.
If not, why not?
Is this right and proper?
What is your opinion on that?
.
(SV) This is a very important question.
The Rules of Procedure do not allow this.
You will have to discuss this outside the Chamber.
Questions to Mr Barnier
-
Question No 44 by (H-0020/00):
This is all I can say.
However, things are really quite different.
Will the Commission remain silent?
Will it discuss the matter?
What can the Commission do about that?
I will monitor this situation very closely.
-
Question No 45 by (H-0041/00):
Commissioner, thank you for your answer.
Could you please give an answer on this issue?
Quite simply there is no question of this.
-
Question No 46 by (H-0052/00):
Please excuse this very legal answer.
Is that really authorised?
Question No 47 by (H-0088/00):
Questions to Mr Bolkestein
You may answer the question.
I have given you my answer.
This is all I can say today.
Question No 51 by (H-0049/00):
Unfortunately, a number of deadlines have been exceeded.
I hope that this building will then be occupied.
Question No 53 by (H-0057/00):
Question No 54 by (H-0117/00):
My position on this is clear.
Thank you for your reply.
Such a rule is only normal.
My second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol.
It also has important implications for public health.
The Commission has no means of influence here.
We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products.
That is indeed distortion of the internal market.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Community policy in the field of water (continuation)
The public must have a right to clean water.
Action must get under way immediately.
We cannot afford to waste time.
Water and air surround us everywhere.
We share them with everyone on this earth.
Water is a prerequisite for human life.
Nothing could be further from the truth!
We have three outstanding problems.
Amendments Nos 4.
We need to look very carefully at those.
Is this a Utopian ideal?
Is this a return to pre-industrial society?
I think not.
We are all entitled to clean drinking water.
These are all improvements to the common position.
In Finland surface waters are very clean.
The process does not require a chemical sewage plant.
This applies to every country.
This is a reductionist directive.
That is how the common position has been worded.
The same can be said with regard to transfers.
Water is a scarce and precious natural resource.
These include, for example, costs and transfers.
We cannot be accused of bad management.
We are not doing a bad job of management.
Commissioner, Andalusia is not Lapland.
.
I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances.
I just want to emphasise this further.
This is also expressed in Recital 14.
This proposal can therefore be approved.
Another important area is protection of the groundwater.
The proposal cannot therefore be approved.
.
I accept that.
Thank you, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.
Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE)
rapporteur.
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular.
There is no other such policy.
This is not enough.
The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those.
Secondly, the financial contributions.
Is this not a contradiction?
Commissioner, we must be consistent.
The environment is in a parlous state.
Even EUR 850 million is not enough.
I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential.
Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument.
Thank you, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Modernising social protection
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another.
It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision.
This is largely due to historical factors.
The labour market is also changing.
Another challenge is presented by technical development.
We must meet these challenges together.
This is good, but it is not enough.
We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process.
Clear guidelines and indicators are required.
All this is important.
Equality has no pillar of its own.
There, it is mainstreaming which applies.
All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality.
This is something we have borne in mind.
These proposals favour women especially.
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee.
This indicates that we have a broad consensus.
I think this proposal is a good one.
Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals.
The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness.
These aspects are very much interconnected.
The challenges are different.
It is a report which tries to give direction.
But this new course of action is very exciting.
So coordination and cooperation are facts of life.
But convergence should be about goals, not means.
There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions.
This seems to be a good thing and useful.
Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries.
The reality is quite different.
Social policy is chiefly a national process.
Local democracy provides the framework for social security.
I endorse this view.
We need common objectives with a realistic timetable.
I also welcome the Commission's communication.
This is not an option for us any more.
It is an imperative.
And therein lies the paradox.
That is something we would do well to recognise.
Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
WIPO treaty
Forgeries are big business.
It also creates protection for software and databases.
There are problems regarding the term "author" .
For example, it has not been defined.
This too has not been solved.
That would not be a good thing.
Parliament cannot change these details.
Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies.
I think they should have.
The problem has been overcome.
I think this conflicts with Article 13.
What does the Commission have to say to that?
However, there are also public interests at stake.
Why does the Commission say nothing about this?
Does it in fact want to privatise education?
If so, what form should this take?
This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy.
drawing up regulations.
It would be difficult to reply in the affirmative.
Only in this way will the regulations be accepted.
.
This is important.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport.
(The Minutes were approved)
It was erroneously included in today' s agenda.
The smell is absolutely disgusting!
Can you please do something about it?
Coherence of EU policies with development
.
We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies.
Firstly the agreement on political issues.
It is thus not confined to EC activities.
Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration.
Negotiations will start no later than 2002.
A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations.
This is part of the solution.
Everything has become more and more complex.
This is also true of development cooperation.
This is where we want to go.
Mr President, I thank Mr Nielson.
We want to talk about coherence.
This is the topic.
But what have we seen since then?
It is too crazy for words, really.
Another example is cacao.
It seems to be heading this way nevertheless.
What are we actually doing then?
The inconsistency is astonishing.
This is also at the request of the citizens.
Mr President, these are no arbitrary objectives.
Reality is obstinate.
What we need here is an integral approach.
The third area of incoherence is human rights.
We say that we want to protect human rights.
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights.
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns.
We are always saying think globally, act locally.
And what about agriculture and the environment?
There is neither coherence nor human decency here.
Is the Council discussing this issue?
How decisions are made is all-important.
co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly.
I will give some examples shortly.
Some of these issues have been discussed in depth.
There are no boundaries for Community policies.
This is particularly true of agricultural policy.
They are being played off against each other.
This is not new.
I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy.
So there is a whole raft of contradictions.
We have to be aware of this.
That is a fact of life.
Take the trade agreements.
Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes.
Action simply has not been taken.
The results are certainly not what we expected.
What could be the cause of this?
The first is concerned with conflict resolution.
The UN has a peace plan.
The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies.
The Member States have spent similar amounts.
This has been talked about for years.
For these are prerequisite to any development.
The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow.
We are discussing coherence here.
Why should we add to them?
Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent.
.
.
This discussion is not new.
We should not be too masochistic.
There is a limit to how useful that is.
Finally, I thank you again for this debate.
We have to reconcile those different approaches.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission
The European Union voted against that motion.
.
The New York stage is different from Geneva.
Secondly, Cuba.
So what should we do?
That is a point that deserves serious consideration.
We have made our views very clear to them.
I wish we were closer to that.
Where does all that leave us this year?
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
Welcome

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000)

I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance.
BÃ¶ge report (A5-0023/2000)

CederschiÃ¶ld report (A5-0008/2000)
.
We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation.
Graefe zu Baringdorf (A5-0015/2000)
.
Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000)
This is why we are abstaining.
We want EQUAL to go ahead.
I also abstained for another reason.
.
.
.
EQUAL stands for "equality" .
It must be seen to deliver.
There must be flexibility.
The figure is now 5.35%.
I also stressed the need for prevention.
.
Unfortunately, this involves a significant reduction in appropriations.
The Commission did not do that.
.
Lieneman report (A5-0027/2000)
.
Particularly important issues are the following:
the new indexes for water should be compulsory;
provisions should be made for protecting groundwater from pollution;
provisions should be made for purifying contaminated groundwater;
a shorter timescale is needed for implementing the directive.
(End of fiction).
.
But the source is threatening to run dry.
But tomorrow will be too late.
We have thrown water a life-belt.
.
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.
The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy.
.
These are the main reasons for my vote.
.
.
It damages Parliament.
Is that the message we want to send out?
.
.
The foregoing is the reason for our vote.
.
It has clear, ambitious objectives.
We share them.
It sets environmental parameters close to zero.
Andersson report (A5-0033/2000)
No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation" .
.
No-one would benefit from this situation.
.
.
Of course we need to modernise these systems.
.
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.
The same applies to labour market policy.
.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission (continuation)
I would also mention the right to develop.
This commitment creates unease and has an impact.
We have seen proof of this on numerous occasions.
The EU' s role is important.
This is wholly unacceptable.
Basic human rights are not accepted in China.
Nor is there freedom of information now.
China likes doublespeak.
I think we need to seize the opportunity.
We need to associate ourselves with the American initiative.
We need to work.
What do they see?
They see forests being cut down and deserts spreading.
They see us killing each other.
They see us restricting each other's liberties.
They see a never-ending series of local wars.
We all know the picture.
Only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law.
I say: shame on them!
That is positive.
Does it reflect this vision of coherence?
Such policy should comprise various components.
Mr President, this Parliament is fragmented and divided.
It seems contradictory.
Women are systematically raped.
Children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle.
First of all, the policy comes too late.
The human rights policy is also too selective.
This is something which I very much regret.
Take Sudan.
Britain has re-opened its embassy in Khartoum.
Canada has invited the Sudanese for peace talks.
Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created.
We must not waiver in that commitment.
Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked.
We must emphasise Europe' s spiritual history.
We must live with our consciences."
I wish to discuss two matters.
First of all, civil society.
It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet.
We must never forget to defend civil society.
I also want to mention the death penalty.
It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy.
The first country is Indonesia.
Tens of thousands of people are on the run.
The situation is badly managed.
Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma.
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia.
Justice needs to be done in East Timor.
.
.
It has been a useful debate.
I hope we can have further debates like this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Cyprus and Malta
The next item is the joint debate on:
We need this instrument.
The Commission is able to adopt some of them.
The Council has also agreed on this figure.
It is very much a political issue.
That is how matters stand on the political front.
These funds are not inconsiderable.
.
The two processes are separate processes.
This is the crux of the matter.
This is an extremely risky strategy.
Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz.
The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone.
Conditions are ripe.
Government, for its appropriation of Greek estates.
.
Mrs Schroedter described this as a lack of coherence.
I do not believe this to be the case.
These will take place at a later date.
Indeed that was the idea behind it.
.
.
Forgive me Mr Poos.
Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Question Time (Council)
We will examine questions to the Council.
Question No 1 by (H-0022/00):
This kind of situation should not be allowed.
Question No 2 by (H-0024/00):
Even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped.
But where will you place the emphasis?
I perfectly understand Mr Staes' s concerns.
Question No 3 by (H-0027/00):
Everyone is free to hold such views.
That was how it was.
Rapid action is called for!
Question No 4 by (H-0028/00):
.
This must be our top priority.
Question No 5 by (H-0031/00):
Question No 6 by (H-0122/00):
.
What do we have today?
(The President interrupted the speaker)
We are therefore all to blame.
That, however, is not my question.
My question to the President-in-Office is twofold.
I did not defend attacks on civilians.
Question No 7 by (H-0035/00):
Will it cover immigrants etc.?)?
Secondly, there is the content of the charter.
This applies whether the document is binding or not.
This issue is also under discussion.
I do not know whether everyone shares this view.
Mr RÃ¼big has the floor.
Both parties were once part of the government.
I do not know, Mr Martin.
Question No 8 by (H-0042/00):
.
These standards already exist today.
Question No 9 by (H-0044/00):
.
The Court also guarantees proper financial management.
This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248.
It is extremely important.
Their reports are extremely detailed and very important.
Question No 10 by (H-0053/00):
.
That is my first question.
We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations.
I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem.
We both come from Sweden.
We have extensive services, too.
.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
You are most welcome.
(Applause)
You are a first class European.
(Applause)
So what exactly do we mean by Europeanism?
I do not think that is a fair judgement.
They stuck out a mile.
I refer to the civil society.
This experience should encourage us to be vigilant.
I think that is extremely important.
It is also high time.
Allow me to reiterate and highlight this conviction.
Europe needs to get its own act together first.
Thank you for your attention.
(Long and enthusiastic standing ovation)
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr President.
ACP-EU Joint Assembly
I pay special tribute to him for his success.
I visited Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge.
I await with interest developments in Cuba.
This I think is the new Convention.
These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly.
I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe.
I beg to move acceptance of this report.
They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries.
The after-shocks can still be felt.
ACP cooperation is a dynamic process.
That also means strengthening the democratic institutions.
That is important, for at least three reasons.
We must put a stop to this trend.
We must begin by writing off debts.
We must follow up words with action.
The challenge was immense.
Consistency and action are needed.
The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential.
People in the poor countries are beginning to despair.
.
I do not agree.
So the "Grappa War" is over.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM
Firstly, there is the regional approach.
There has to be a willingness to cooperate.
I think Commissioner Patten understands that too.
I might never have studied otherwise.
I would quote the PHARE programme as an example.
Since then, expectations have been high.
This applies to them and us.
Is there any prospect of membership?
This is very much on their minds.
This is not the Union' s only contribution.
Will it do the same to us?
Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason.
This model function also applies to regional cooperation.
I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia.
That is why it is so important.
Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example.
It is absolutely absurd.
This question needs to be resolved urgently.
Why has the Council not informed us of this?
What we are doing here is not hypocritical.
Macedonia did not go through a war.
This requires internal stability.
They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model.
External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation.
It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated.
But what then instead?
We need to wait and see what happens there.
What else can we do to support this opposition?
This is an urgent duty for the EU.
I am talking about Milosevic.
.
It is very helpful.
That has never been the intention.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
Agreement on comitology
.
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny.
A key problem is the time factor.
I just have one more request.
The German version is not very clear here.
I would ask for that to be checked again.
For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur.
Let us remember what is at stake here.
Firstly, the whole system is obscure.
We are to know who is on each committee.
We are to know when they meet.
We are to get the agendas.
So that is at least a step forward.
We adopt legislation in the European Union.
We expect the Commission to implement it.
Here too there is at least some progress.
That is a more reasonable system.
That, too, is a step forward.
Parliament has no equivalent power.
Not that we do so every week.
That is not correct.
We must be very vigilant.
So it is a step forward.
My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward.
It is never easy working on comitology.
Mr Corbett set out Parliament' s concerns.
So how far have we come?
I think this is a good agreement.
From here on things are going to be easier.
We think there are other positive advances too.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure
We have already heard about the various aspects involved.
Firstly, for the single market.
Secondly, for economic and monetary union.
It is good that the procedure exists.
It also inspires a few political comments.
The Stability Pact is a given in Europe.
This is the theory behind it, anyway.
A drop in standards should not be allowed.
.
This regulation is purely instrumental.
But we see no reason to lower our guard.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
Increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro
.
It is a definite and concrete issue.
It is about our common currency.
The denominations of the euro are well known.
Thank you for listening.
All that is indeed very true and correct.
It is easy to counterfeit the euro.
It is a highly complex problem.
So what is the European Union doing about it?
That is what I would have preferred, personally.
However, I find these passports inadequate.
Counterfeiting is not on the list.
So we come back to the previous problem.
But there has been nothing for a year.
We are also concerned with the question of cooperation.
But that cannot be helped.
That is what this framework decision is about.
I certainly appreciate that.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
Resumption of the sitting
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
UCITS
II.
.
The other concerns the collective investment undertakings.
They are very important in this case.
There are different views on this.
The current situation is not good.
.
I thank him for that.
We have achieved a compromise solution.
We are therefore faced with two options.
There is no freedom without rules.
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures.
Is this speculative?
Not at all.
We must put an end to this.
This brings us to the two proposals for directives.
It aims to strengthen consumer protection and security.
The same cannot be said of the first proposal.
(The President cut the speaker off)
UCITS are a success story within the European Union.
They are a safe product, traded cross-border.
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here.
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers.
I salute Mr Schmidt.
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn.
I shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment.
Firstly, I welcome proposal No 1.
It simplifies things and brings things up to date.
The range of options for investors was limited.
It was therefore necessary to update the existing regulation.
.
The two proposals form a coherent whole.
So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States
This leads me to another point.
This is why this report is so important.
Mr Schulz should be aware of this.
There are certainly no restrictions in its scope.
It would truly perplex me.
We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties.
There are two reasons why we are saying no.
We would warn against that trend.
That is a dramatic development.
.
(Applause)
This leaves it wide open to abuse.
That is not guaranteed.
This issue is extremely serious.
What did I understand on reading the related texts?
Rezala should never have been in France.
Quite the reverse, in fact.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed?
Is one free when security is no longer assured?
It is not just a question of style.
It is nothing less than legal torture.
We need hard and fast rules.
.
Most say it is about time.
However, we must be realistic.
VOTE
Goebbels (PSE).
You were asking for the place to be changed.
My apologies once again for my mistake.
Are there any objections to this oral amendment?
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)
I was told that this was a personal response.
Note will be taken of it in the Minutes.
Relating to Amendments Nos 22 and 24
.
This is unquestionably the case.
This would provide an elegant solution to the problem.
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament approved the legislative resolution)
Before the vote
It rather seems like a contradiction in terms.
Relating to Amendment No 31

I just wanted to correct this.
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)

Proposal for a joint resolution on human rights
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Relating to Amendment No 6

This clarification would certainly meet with our approval.
Thank you, Mrs Frassoni, for your clarification.

Company restructuring in Europe
.
Sometimes this calls for mergers of activities.
This is what intelligent restructuring is about.
We thank you for that.
Action is not limited to legislation.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
Thank you for your statement.
But thank you for your remarks.
Commissioner Liikanen, we expect an authoritative intervention.
And the result of this is social dumping.
The company went under despite this.
This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought.
The market is a law unto itself.
Why should this be the case?
Michelin caused a great stir.
I do hope that this will not be necessary.
Everything has already been said on this subject.
We must not permit that.
EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer.
We need more joined-up policy making on these issues.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken later this evening.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain)
Yet it is not enough to regret the situation.
We must therefore act.
Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration.
Finally we are producing a census of immigrants.
We are all immigrants.
Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately.
Yet a worrying situation is apparent.
The EU can and must speak out.
I was therefore aware how the situation was developing.
Employers would be lost without immigrants.
For four days, the immigrants were collectively hounded.
Women and children were beaten.
That is my conclusion today.
Two types of measure are required for this purpose.
.
Naturally I completely endorse what they have said.
It seems to me a fitting description of them.
Those rights are, by definition, universal.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.
Human rights
Press freedom in Angola
Native Americans in the US - Dineh
Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky
We need to cooperate with the Council too.
I think we should give this some thought.
Thank you, Mr Staes.
Why not?
Disputes have been going on for months.
Otherwise, we will lose all credibility.
There is no reason for them to be there.
She was neither a terrorist nor a UCK activist.
That is tragic to my mind.
The sanctions are now slowly being relaxed.
It seems not.
Otherwise we will be just as lacking in credibility.
Mitrovica must not remain divided.
I believe we must prevent this from happening.
I endorse what Mr Sakellariou had to say.
Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge.
Atrocities were not even being recorded.
Mitrovica is a tragic example of this.
I believe that the European Union must do likewise.
What she has said here is completely justified.
That is what NATO intervention brought to an end.
We have failed miserably on this front.
Press freedom in Angola
It would be the first in a long time.
So I welcome it as such.
Yet this is not the situation.
Angola does not enjoy rule of law.
It is a repressive dictatorship.
These cases keep occurring.
This war must be stopped.
The people of Angola deserve better.
This is Angola' s reality.
We are now expressing our horror concerning this war.
This is a war which transcends its borders.
It is not just UNITA which is to blame.
The government too is responsible for this continuing violence.
But what do these sanctions mean?
Mr President, the facts are well-known.
In my opinion, Angola is a test case.
Native Americans in the US - Dineh
The credibility of the industrialised north is at stake.
So we need to do this.
It is important to point this out.
The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally.
People should no longer be forced to move.
This is not the case here.
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling.
The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians.
The population was not allowed any input.
This resembles a kind of trade in human beings.
So let us contact the United States now!
He maintained that he has the case in hand.
And just what is Mr CFSP doing?
What are we doing about it?
I beg you to intervene.
The facts are clear.
Hence his disappearance of over one month.
Nor is it a mere luxury.
Cambodia
The pattern of intimidation is clear.
All this is happening on a daily basis.
.
There are alarming reports of human rights violations.
We await a proper response from the Russians.
Thank you very much Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.
Danube environmental disaster
That is not how it works!
The polluter ought to pay.
I would be in favour of its doing so.
The delta of the Danube is in danger.
The number is huge.
Who is going to pay?
.
We stand ready to do so.
That is obviously crucial.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTE
.
.
Tourism and employment
, rapporteur.
Those figures are incomparably higher for some countries.
Is that not an alarming thought?
Students are an obvious example.
I am referring to sex tourism.
Unfortunately, his text has not survived the vote.
This brings me to the content of the report.
Even in the tourism industry.
It is a very extensive report.
I hope that the Commission will not forget that.
He has convinced me of that.
Let us look at some of these reasons.
We are losing market share.
I hope you will help us.
But we must support our tourism!
This document stems from the previous Commission.
It regards tourism for senior citizens.
People can be trained in communication skills and creativity.
We need to set the scene for this.
.
This will determine the success of our work.
These possibilities should be fully exploited.
This will dramatically change the way it operates.
Commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach.
Mr Medina Ortega asked me some very concrete questions.
Why is it so important in that sector?
That is where the potential is.
That is the real difficulty which we must overcome.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.

I am therefore voting against the proposal.
European postal services
It can hardly be because customers are satisfied.
That shows that competition really is working.
Perhaps we can discuss this later on.
That is usually the case.
Mr President, there is a mystery.
I am very fond of him.
That has only happened recently.
We really have not progressed very far.
The postal service is not just for Christmas.
It is for life.
It is about keeping communities together.
The postal service is also the bus service.
The postal service is also the social service.
The postal service is also the doctor.
We will cut them off.
The postal services are important.
That message must be taken back from here today.
The Commission must listen to it.
This should first of all stand for better service.
My second point concerns the universal provision of services.
I would welcome more concrete information on this.
The postal service is also extremely important to companies.
What exactly do you intend to liberalise?
Apparently, they were.
Should we complain about this delay?
We do not think so.
But who defines these tasks?
What has become of it?
Do we have the results of this impact study?
Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle.
So be it.
I come from a rural area.
We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject.
But what will those limits be?
It is time we stopped this trend.
A fault confessed is half redressed.
But they might accidentally do great damage.
The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability.
On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously.
Stand by universality and affordability!
This service must therefore be kept public.
I think ours is a different approach!
They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas.
It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships.
The post office is democracy.
I would suggest that there is a solution.
It is already employed widely in the transport sector.
Let us call this a negative tender franchise.
That is the measure of the problem.
.
Further liberalisation will occur afterwards.
Does that not say a lot about management ability?
This applies both to the post and other sectors.
In a sense this is where its work begins.
Most companies hate competition.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Postal services must continue to be public services.
I wholeheartedly agree.
I know that this service is unprofitable.
.
I am a European and even a federalist.
President.
Parliament has completed the agenda.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Terrorism, whatever form it takes, is unacceptable.
The following is a translated extract from his autobiography.
'We are in Europe.
What difference does it make to be Basque?
Surely it is all the same thing.
You can be what you want to be.
May he rest in peace.
(Loud applause)
(Loud applause)
ETA must be condemned.
Let us make ourselves heard!
We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg.
May I ask: Quousque tandem - Noiz arte?
His name was Enrique Casas.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, Senator Casas was my husband.
(Loud and sustained applause)
Then we democrats can talk.
(Loud applause)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
But we shall have a decision very soon.
(The Minutes were adopted)
Reforming the Commission
The second point is human resources.
It is the central part of our reform.
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too.
Again, that will be a very demanding challenge.
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.
We shall now move on to Question Time.
There is effective legal precaution.
I do not use those as an excuse.
I would like everything to happen much more quickly.
It is better to do it absolutely properly.
Two questions if I may.
Let the managers manage.
Is this reflected in the White Paper?
The question of transitional periods is worrying us.
There is neither soft nor hard law.
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction.
Thank you for the presentation.
Excessive paperwork.
That is a clear complaint that we get.
That needs to be addressed.
I know I can rely on everyone here.
That concludes Question Time.
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened.
I will speak of this briefly.
You can be satisfied with the progress made.
We are therefore working diligently in this respect.
We are not mad.
I will set this out in five points.
How can we do this?
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana.
Mr Solana, you mentioned Sintra.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Of course, we welcome this with open arms.
Military intervention must only ever be a last resort.
I commend you for having made that point.
Let us be peaceable and live in harmony ourselves.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
I want to concentrate on Kosovo.
Everything else is wishful thinking.
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000?
You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles.
A man with three children and he was murdered.
We need policemen in Kosovo right now!
So that is the world as it is today.
I think these meetings are not to be missed.
Let us just consider for a moment.
What is the basis of armed action?
It is still the old imperial service.
In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome.
Do you think I am going over the top?
I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards.
'Restore hope' , do you remember?
Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern.
We all very much share this opinion.
I would like to hear your opinion.
It concerns the next IGC.
Can you tell us your position on this subject?
Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe.
Mr Solana can play an important role in this.
He is not stupid.
Certainly not!
He is a driven man, a competent man.
This too is unacceptable in my view.
But look at us now!
Some of them are our ACP partners.
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment.
We are now unable to guide the peace.
Actually, I hear less and less about this.
But is there not more to it than that?
Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks.
Is this actually how we want things done?
Will it be omitted?
I wonder how this will develop.
That would seem odd to me.
Will they also take part in our defence policy?
Spain and Franco were not one and the same.
It is you who has created this mess.
I will give you an example.
60 000.
This has not just happened.
NATO is largely European.
What about the infrastructures?
Will current programmes continue to be implemented?
Has any thought been given to the matter?
Has it been discussed?
We cannot leave it simply to governments.
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra.
This is grossly unprofessional!
Can you prevent this from happening in future?
Lastly, a word on the subject of Chechnya.
Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe.
My second question concerns the following matter.
It has been a very long session of questions.
But let me start with the first.
We are not trying to duplicate anything.
If anybody answered that, he is wrong.
It is very important to be talking about prevention.
It is very important.
We do not have to invent them.
They exist already.
Is ECHO not a preventative agency?
To prevent people from killing one another.
But let me also tell you something.
We do not need unarmed policemen or traffic policemen.
I do not think there is a risk.
Let me say two things only.
That help will be needed.
I do not know how to answer that question.
I do not know.
There were several questions about the stability pact.
That was done and is continuing to be done
We are doing what we can.
There are probably many more questions that were asked.
So again, rhetoric and reality.
All those things come together.
Where is the beef?
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
Women in the decision-making process
.
Globalisation has various implications for democracy.
Women were not thought of as having rights.
This is the position that the EU must adopt.
So let us build that democracy!
The last century was marked by three periods.
There were women everywhere.
And a woman was elected.
But the figures tell the true story.
And the figures still give Europe cause for concern.
We need organisation and statistical monitoring.
I should like to be absolutely categorical.
(Applause)
I am optimistic that we shall succeed.
The bet before us is a bet with time.
Future generations of women must not be sidelined.
(Applause)
Women always have a different viewpoint from men.
Some Members have even come out against this.
Unfortunately, the same does not hold true everywhere.
We should fight to break through this glass ceiling.
That is absolutely crucial.
The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures.
Do we have a special problem in this regard?
The second point is the enlargement of the Union.
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this.
Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process.
Women are no homogenous collective.
Women belong to different social classes.
Women have different individual needs and interests.
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics.
Women deserve more than a quota.
Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead.
Do not take too long to send it back.
It is quite logical, it is consistent!
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority.
That is unacceptable in a democracy.
We have high hopes for what you will achieve.
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this.
And how should we achieve this?
We would, in this way, violate democracy.
.
This was universally acknowledged.
This is the reality of the situation.
This is one problem.
The debate is a deeply political one.
There are two approaches.
The first is a policy of persuasion.
I can, therefore all women can.
Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics.
Because women have to deal with different realities.
Because they have fewer opportunities.
Because they have a different level of education.
Because they have to face social obstacles.
Not necessary!
They have all been persuaded!
On paper!
Thirdly, we must expect things to change gradually.
Quotas alone are not enough.
On this we are clear.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow morning.
Floods in Mozambique
Let me turn to the assistance provided so far.
There have already been hundreds of deaths.
Helicopters are therefore needed.
The machinery mobilising the aid is too slow.
The time has also come to demand greater efficiency.
The water levels continue to rise.
Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable.
Commissioner Nielson is flying out today.
What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of?
.
Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift.
Are we ready to pay for those resources?
Thank you, Mrs Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
Union Economy (1999)
This is the challenge.
This was the first pillar of my recommendation.
Why should this be so?
Is it down to the European Central Bank?
Definitely not.
The European Union is in good financial shape.
The European Central Bank is headed by convincing personalities.
The forecasts are absolutely excellent.
Unemployment is expected to fall, albeit slowly.
In some countries unemployment is now below 5%.
In other words, things are moving too slowly.
The rapporteur believes in growth and stimulating demand.
He regards this as a panacea.
This involves both supply- and demand-orientated measures.
This also has something to do with confidence.
We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention.
It will be voting against it.
Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial.
In Europe we have taxation systems that impede performance.
The interests of both employer and employee coincide here.
We have enough labels, but not enough content.
Europe' s major problem is still unemployment.
Why is the European economy not growing sufficiently?
It cannot continue like that.
I think Mr Katiforis also appreciates the fact.
Europe must become more competitive.
That is what differentiates us from the United States.
That does not happen in the United States.
Surely not with Japan?
Take a look at the health care system there.
This report is a wake-up call to Europe.
It is as simple as that.
It cannot create jobs just by government spending.
The real world simply does not work like that.
What will you find in the Prodi paper?
This is precisely the logic that Katiforis used.
That is precisely the intention behind our proposed amendments.
We have that opportunity right now.
Let us grasp it.
.
Employment is growing at a good rate.
We need public and private investment.
What policy should we use to achieve these objectives?
We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth.
Firstly, private investment must be assisted.
Common fisheries policy
Both biological and economic information are included.
My Group has included two reasonable requests.
The implementing regulation will clear a few matters up.
Moreover, can we rely sufficiently on this information?
The amendment requests independent verification of fleet capacity data.
These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly.
Firstly, a few comments on the first report.
I wholeheartedly endorse these amendments.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Combating certain fish diseases
What about women?
The ultimate consequence of this is job losses.
And people have spoken in the past about BSE.
So it also has to do with environmental protection.
The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously.
The virus harms cold-blooded animals.
So further thought is necessary.
Those could perpetuate an infection.
This is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods.
I can partly accept Amendment No 11.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Protection of juvenile marine organisms
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine.
The recommendation for this dates from 1996.
All laudable stuff.
I do not know what the metric equivalent is.
The common fisheries policy is not working.
In mixed fisheries, you cannot discriminate.
Let me illustrate this with a topical example.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
This will serve to publicise our protectionist actions.
I grew up by the North Sea.
However, biological diversity is under threat.
But that is nothing new.
The Bergen conference made a good start.
These were just a few examples.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment
This is an unwise policy.
One can quote from the communication.
That appeared in the communication published last July.
Such pressures are greatest in Europe.
I recommend the report to the House.
The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious.
The same yardstick should be used for everyone.
The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear.
So we must practise selective fishing.
Aquaculture should also be monitored.
I would like to touch briefly on these amendments.
And just as well, in my view.
Fishing is an economic activity.
We need even more wind in our sails here!
I shall, of course, be brief.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Bankruptcy procedures
This is regrettable, but no doubt inevitable.
They would create additional complications and delimitation problems.
That is not the route that has been taken.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.)
Shipwreck of the Erika
I thank him for this.
We expect concrete action from the European Commission.
How can those affected be compensated?
Fine speeches and bitter tears are not much use.
There is certainly more to solidarity than making speeches.
I welcome this with open arms.
My demands go further, however.
This is the challenge Europe faces.
Europe' s credibility is at stake.
The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate.
I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner.
This is not acceptable.
The French State has released funds for compensating damage.
This is essential.
Our resolution calls for this.
I am pleased to hear it.
35 000 deaths in Caracas.
Thousands of fish and birds have been killed.
The polluter pays principle must be applied consistently.
I advocate zero tolerance of marine pollution.
We must learn from past experiences.
Effective compensation is essential.
Parliament adopts a resolution after every maritime disaster.
I would like to advocate this.
These three proposals are quite specific.
He has given us some important information.
This is the right way to go.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
EC-Israel trade agreement
We agree with the Commission on this.
We are being cruel to be kind.
I am pleased that the Commissioner shares this view.
I have a couple of questions, Commissioner.
The choice ought to be simple.
It can only be founded upon international law.
We have urged Israel to exercise supervision accordingly.
What should our policy be?
I will start at the end and work back.
None at all!
He is out of a job.
EU fruit producers might also stand to benefit indirectly.
Thank you very much, Mrs Banotti.
The debate is closed.
VOTE
Hence we withdraw our signature to Amendment No 4.
Thank you very much.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Paragraph 3:
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
- Attwooll report (A5-0038/2000)
Amendment No 1 serves to clarify the text considerably.
Amendment No 2 amends the initial Commission proposal.
Amendment No 5 serves to mitigate the Commission proposal.
Hudghton report (A5-0036/2000)
The disease chiefly affects the Scottish salmon industry.
It was detected in this region in May 1998.
Today, 240 salmon farms are affected by ISA.
We look forward to that.
Finland too has just elected a female President.
Katiforis report (A5-0041/2000)
We need a completely different system.
These leaders must resign.
I must condemn this!
.
I would like to highlight the following:
The resolution turns its back on such an approach.
Every day, further pollution increases the toll.
This is just scandalous.
Quite obviously all victims should receive 100% compensation.
Everyone must play their own part.
The Commission should ensure the coordination of information.
Katiforis report (A5-0017/2000)
Effectiveness and excessive regulation are not compatible.
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
The session is adjourned.
Resumption of the session
Thank you, Mrs GrÃ¶ner.
They now have two television channels.
I hope you enjoy it.
It is not only in Strasbourg that this happens.
Thank you, Mr Jonckheer.
I will happily comply with your request.
Thank you, Mr Blak.
Thank you, Mr SeppÃ¤nen.
Special European Council (23-24 March 2000 in Lisbon)
We should not however, harbour any illusions.
Knowledge is today the real raw material of work.
It is stronger and more solid here.
I would like to state our objective clearly here.
This requires coordination between our science and research policies.
Lastly, the fourth pillar.
(Sustained applause)
And it is not going to go away.
These are operational points which cannot be dismissed.
The tools are surely known to all.
We might mention the skills deficit as one example.
I am going mention them very briefly.
I will refer firstly to the political deficit.
I believe this is important.
The second point is the strategic challenge.
I believe that this is important.
(Applause)
(Applause)
There are too few entrepreneurs in Europe.
There is too little enterprise in Europe.
This truly would be an enabling exercise.
It is a trap.
But they are used in a passive way.
Why?
We know all of this.
You are thus acting as accomplices in this process.
In the EU, it increased to 10.9%.
That is my first question.
My second question is about the Employment Summit.
I congratulate you, Mr President-in-Office.
This is a very serious risk.
This has cost jobs and the trend is continuing.
The result is sobering.
E-commerce and e-business certainly have a great future.
Is the Council acting upon this?
But is this reflected in the policy?
What will this Summit actually add to this?
We have experienced this.
This should not happen.
It is their defensive nature.
So it is possible for Europeans to match this.
Electronic commerce will cut out many middlemen.
Mr President, we place our trust in you.
Why?
I wonder what has happened to it!
I have seen IT companies which are unbelievably spoiled.
Above all, integration mechanisms should be created.
Here I need only mention mobile telephones.
Why?
Where then do Europe's shortcomings actually lie?
We in Europe are deficient where training is concerned.
There are other areas that we must look at.
Who could challenge such an ambition?
That must be right.
We cannot just focus on the new economy.
We must pay attention to the old.
This scenario has moved into the foreseeable future.
We are a long way from it today.
Congratulations!
This is the most effective way of reducing unemployment.
That simply leaves the fulcrum.
The fulcrum is provided by resources.
It is thus up to you to create them.
This is not your objective.
I refer to the public services.
But we cannot stop there.
They are a tool for political decision making.
What we are doing here has certain implications.
Lastly, a final word on social cohesion.
That would give you another ally for your policy.
Europe needs to achieve full employment.
We must improve the effectiveness of active employment policies.
I hope that it does just that!
Within this concern, employment is linked to competitiveness.
All of this is absolutely essential.
We need technological change and institutional reform.
The first point concerns corporate governance.
Their cooperation in these activities should also be outlined.
Firstly, massive investment in people is needed.
, Commission.
Firstly, we are not starting from scratch.
However, we must be careful.
Therefore, our responsibility is both economic and social.
There is therefore a very clear strategy for Lisbon.
The problem is simple.
The debate is closed.
There are three reasons for this.
That does not apply to the plenary.
Environmental dimension in the development process
rapporteur.
Might I just ask for one more thing?
The fact is, we shall need further consultations.
It is now our task to counteract this.
From this perspective we cannot fail to be satisfied.
But why not?
The previous regulation expired at the end of 1999.
Comitology:
Therefore the Commission does not support it.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Conservation and sustainable forest management
(Mr Bouwman interrupted the President.)
Bouwman.
There is another report first.
President.
Thank you very much, Mr Bouwman.
Please forgive me.
My files have got in rather a muddle.
Forget what I have said so far.
We will start again.
Thank you for that.
The biodiversity of our planet is at stake.
For this reason, I will be brief.
Amendment No 4 is considered acceptable.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Ship-generated waste and cargo residues
Now, Mr Jarzembowski, is the great moment!
Normal shipping operations account for double this amount.
Not only that.
In other words, this affects our own habitat.
These will re-emerge in some shape or form.
There is no financial incentive.
Let me illustrate this quite clearly.
I do believe that somehow we will make it.
They must therefore be provided.
We agree on these points.
There are two precedents.
Why would the North Sea be so dirty?
That is the decisive issue.
For these reasons support our 'no-special-fee' system.
There are a few points at stake tomorrow.
Nothing would change.
It is a sound directive.
Ports must be equipped with reception facilities.
Inspection is on its way, at long last.
This is very important.
This is good for the environment.
How do we charge the fees?
We are all agreed on the polluter pays principle.
The opinions are divided.
Habits, apparently, are also divided.
0.01 is clearly not a substantial part.
This is an extraordinarily important report.
Secondly, polluters must pay, naturally.
And this is where the problem lies.
We are all working towards the same goal.
Many thanks, Mr President.
Thank you, Madam Vice-President.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Technical roadside inspection of commercial vehicles
A good Commissioner should listen!
Can that be deducted from the time?
I do not believe that this is necessary here.
The President has read out a very laborious title.
There is a consensus on that.
The causes are often precisely technical defects.
We must not sit back and accept this.
That would not make any sense.
Neither is it very European.
It would then replace Amendment No 2.
Mr President, everything has been said.
He has completely avoided the word 'harmonisation' .
But he has said what this is all about.
Three vehicles were prohibited from continuing their journey.
Only thirteen were in fully acceptable condition.
They need to be dealt with strictly.
Road safety is a serious matter.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Closing of the session
I declare the 1999-2000 session closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.41 p.m.)
Opening of the session
Agenda
We have nothing against postponement, with this proviso.
Annual legislative programme (continuation)
Nowadays, there are no secret or private plans.
Let us ponder this last point for a moment.
The line we are taking is very clear.
Our task is tantamount to a labour of Sisyphus.
The last point covers consumer rights and health.
Thank you for your cooperation thus far.
We will defend this!
(Applause from the right)
This is what we need to do.
Mr President, you have the right of initiative.
That is not how we envisage Europe to be!
However, we have some concerns about the process.
All this sits rather uneasily with endless lists.
I shall not go into these in depth.
Let me give one example of this.
President Prodi, a friendly word of advice.
An information technology revolution is certainly upon us.
We cannot be passengers when these changes take place.
That is often the case with historical new departures.
I stand by my words.
But the instruments involved are also an important factor.
Take the enormous cattle losses Mongolia has suffered.
But why are we not helping out?
This is because there are too many bureaucratic hurdles.
In short, operational implementation is central.
Relations with Russia are of vital importance.
The second concern relates to budgets.
Where is your coherence, Mr Prodi?
Where does it feature in the text?
It is nowhere to be found.
Another case of paying lip service.
But what is the situation now?
I hope that Mr Prodi is listening.
Two: the internal market.
Three: the preparatory documents.
The two do not go together.
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
This is pre-requisite to Europe' s gaining acceptance.
They must also be recognised by the Commission.
The answer is a lot.
What is the intention there?
How can this be?
We understand that the Commission has to be reformed.
We agree with the objectives of this reform.
I will start with trade.
It is essential.
Follow-up again, please.
We welcome that!
Go for it!
Only you know the answer to this secret.
Go for it, Mr Prodi.
Your task must be an historic task.
You are not the first to try it.
We hope that you succeed.
We welcome the Luxembourg procedure.
I think not.
But is it just about updating?
No.
There are other areas.
She still has no reason for the dismissal.
These are the gaps we need to plug.
The fourth point you touched on was judicial cooperation.
Anyhow, you can count on our support !
The 1999 crab season proved very lucrative.
The men were amazingly young.
The little boy knew better.
His father is a fisherman.
There are the leftovers from the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Why not?
This is true.
So far so good.
That is an important issue.
Mr Liikanen that is.
We need a sound tourism policy for the Union.
It seems that the Commission has not responded.
One out of six is simply not good enough.
We have long been promised measures for this sector.
There has to be a break.
I am fully aware of this.
The problem is rather how to accomplish it.
I feel that this is an extremely important strategy.
We can no longer allow ourselves to disregard Seattle.
No, not this time either!
Thank you very much, Mrs Thors.
The debate is closed.
Cocoa and chocolate products
This was justified and not without results.
The discussion was not without results either.
Should we assent to other legislation?
We wanted an impact study.
We did not want comitology for essential amendments.
We are getting codecision.
I want to pay tribute to Mr Lannoye.
We believe that this is good for consumers.
Quality argues for itself.
You can have additional labelling if you want.
This agony will come to an end today.
After all, there is no accounting for taste.
Prudence is called for once again.
After all, there are conflicting interests involved.
The addition of any other fats spoils the flavour.
Mr President, consumer protection is our prime concern.
Tastes are certainly culturally conditioned.
We are defending the concept of authentic chocolate.
Cocoa butter is the very essence of chocolate.
Today' s vote is a symbolic one.
What then?
It is also a financial obligation.
This is the crux of the problem.
Europe must not adopt the lowest possible standards.
This is the thrust of our amendment.
Yet the matter is actually quite simple.
We always talk in terms of what might happen.
This must be tackled.
I have spoken to medium-sized enterprises.
Parliament has said we need a method of verification.
But is this actually true?
I will start with the information for the consumer.
The margin of error is 2%.
This seems to be unacceptable to me.
Which is it and which will it be?
The citizens we represent are not fools.
Instead, the previous system can be retained.
I think that is completely unnecessary.
I am very much in favour of clear labelling.
This is not what we are asking for.
Nobody.
So what is to be done?
This is what the consumer wants.
Thank you very much, Mrs GrossetÃªte.
Welcome
Cocoa and chocolate products (continuation)
It is an ethical matter.
We have made formal commitments to them.
So what is the reason for this time limit?
Should free trade be granted absolute priority?
Neither Scandinavian, Belgian nor British chocolate is dangerous.
The whole issue is therefore somewhat ridiculous.
So I know what I bought.
I do concur with the rapporteur on one point.
The second amendment may nonetheless be approved in principle.
We may agree with something or we may not.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
There are basically two reasons.
The other reason has to do with comitology.
(The vote was postponed until the following day)
Amendment No 6:
We know full well who they are.
.
But what about vessels from outside the Community?
Will they also be asked for certificates?
This is why we need to find an alternative.
This is absolutely scandalous and intolerable.
EU Charter of Fundamental Rights
I strongly commend the resolution.
We are not one people.
We do not have the same ethnic origin.
We do not speak the same language.
We do not have a single culture and religion.
Therefore, what is it that binds us together?
What enables us to live together?
These are what unite Europe.
Human dignity is sacrosanct!
Human dignity is sacrosanct!
.
Madam President, Europe is founded upon fundamental rights.
Fundamental rights can create identity and citizenship.
These complications ought to be studied more closely.
This is not the case at all.
This is a misconception in my view.
Specific women' s rights do not exist.
Fundamental rights are recognised in our constitutions.
So what is this Charter for?
Being European has an added positive effect.
This is the political message which we must send.
Being European is a positive thing.
We do not believe that a declaration is sufficient.
We should make this very clear.
This is the background against which we are working.
That is important to note.
The charter must contribute to this.
We want more than this.
My second point is to do with its content.
Why?
This is extremely important to my mind.
What purpose does it serve?
What do I personally get out of it?
This contradiction is not politically defensible to my mind.
Have they not learnt the lessons of the past?
Finally, fundamental rights are based on human dignity.
I therefore welcome it.
This question was raised in that document too.
It should not duplicate what is already there.
There is however one risk.
The EU is faced with a number of choices.
Are we to secure our own rights?
Or are we to reinforce human rights throughout Europe?
The rights need to be in two categories.
It cannot and must not be without this reference.
For this reason, we are against it.
This is not a plus, but a minus.
That would be a real step forward.
This was an important goal in the past.
Let us support them in this.
We do it differently and no less effectively.
The first issue regards jurisdiction.
This is a fundamental question.
How far do we intend to go?
How far is the Union prepared to go?
Quite the contrary.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Additional Commission contribution to the IGC
This was one of them.
We confirm this approach.
This is the first principle.
That is the second principle.
In so doing we are seeking to achieve coherence.
We must avoid penalising them.
We eliminated any ideological thinking.
That makes absolute sense.
How will that be defined?
That is a matter of intense debate.
Thank you, Mr Martin, for your assessment.
Indeed I believe that this is the right approach.
Could you comment on this?
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.
Let me make one preliminary remark.
Question Time (Commission)
We will examine questions to the Commission.
First Part
Question No 39 by (H-0174/00):
Yes or no, Commissioner?
Question No 40 by (H-0241/00):
Question No 113 by (H-0251/00):
We have intervened in all corners of the world.
That will require determination, consistency and perseverance.
Might I ask you to clarify one point?
We intend establishing a multi-annual work plan.
We will refer to that on our website.
Question No 41 by (H-0212/00):
I am satisfied with it for two reasons.
Question No 42 by (H-0215/00):
Mr Fischler will reply on behalf of Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
Question No 43 by (H-0242/00):
Second Part
Commissioner, thank you for your answer.
Now it is up to me who I believe.
Questions to Mr Lamy
Question No 44 by (H-0206/00):
Question No 45 by (H-0208/00):
Thank you very much for that reply.
I would urge you to do so.
This is a good question.
That is the first reason.
Let me take the example of spirits.
It is not quite over yet.
Thank you very much, Mr Lamy.
The time allotted to Mr Lamy has fully elapsed.
Questions to Mr Fischler
Question No 48 by (H-0173/00):
For example, what transitional arrangements will there be?
The Commissioner has not been explicit.
Secondly, these are two completely different questions.
Question No 49 by (H-0187/00):
Question No 50 by (H-0190/00):
You mentioned the Council.
That is why we must overcome this problem.
That is no way to solve the problem.
We must draw a distinction.
Question No 51 by (H-0195/00):
This would be a clear distortion of the market.
Question No 52 by (H-0202/00):
The notification periods have been extended.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
Questions to Mrs de Palacio
Question No 61 by (H-0156/00):
Question No 62 by (H-0163/00):
Most countries apply a level of 0.5 mg.
Will this ever be put into the recommendation?
Question No 63 by (H-0164/00):
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Eco-label
Our approach should be different.
The eco-label should not be associated with mediocrity.
Services such as tourism and clean taxes could register.
We are therefore able to accept these amendments.
The Commission supports this overarching objective.
They are only to be found in English.
That was the first point.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you, Commissioner, for your contribution.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Incineration of waste
I then asked for this to be corrected.
Thank you very much for pointing that out.
A cumulative sample is taken for a one-month period.
I strongly urge MEPs to meet these expectations.
What is the advantage of this for the environment?
This is what the common position proposes.
Such a thing does not yet currently exist.
Until now, they applied only to non-dangerous waste.
This subject is incredibly involved.
Moreover, the lobbyists have been something else.
This is a common commitment and a common responsibility.
We must look at the whole hierarchy.
Measuring once every two years would not do that.
These installations are not being brought up to date.
This issue, however, should form an exception.
We should treat this seriously.
Above all we want to save fossil fuels.
We cannot say that it is all wrong.
We should not be constantly re-regulating incinerators.
We also must remember that waste does not disappear.
What will be the long-term consequences of that?
The incineration of mixed waste is bad environmental policy.
Have they received any representations from United Kingdom ministers?
I have given the Commissioner notice of these questions.
The directive makes some headway in that direction.
This should not be happening.
The majority decided in favour of coincineration.
The debate has focused on coincineration.
And this is important and necessary.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We need the specialist toxic waste incinerators.
43 amendments have been tabled.
We consequently accept this principle.
That sounds dangerous.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Ozone in ambient air
We hope that you will consent to it.
I think there are two crucial points here.
I think they are completely incomprehensible and irresponsible.
Ozone smog is still on the increase.
Ozone is always an aggressive substance.
This especially applies to the situation in southern Europe.
Amendment No 12 can be approved in principle.
The principle in Amendment No 16 is also acceptable.
We cannot, however, approve Amendment No 1.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow.
Atmospheric pollutants
These are the amendments passed by the industry committee.
Could we be informed on the progress made?
So the protocol in many ways is a nonsense.
It can give us no confidence whatsoever.
It is a messy political compromise and nothing more.
The vast majority of the amendments I can support.
With what targets are we to start?
It is an important instrument for future environmental policy.
The Member States are given a clearer brief.
They know what they should be aiming for.
I shall give you an example.
That is eight times less.
We are therefore appealing for your help.
I think that this is a good strategy.
All of this seems quite reasonable.
Nevertheless, I must ask a question here.
Would this not be wise?
The Gothenburg Protocol is a step forward.
However, it is nowhere near enough.
Let me now turn to the amendments.
The Commission accepts the principles of Amendment No 23.
We cannot therefore accept Amendment No 31.
The Commission must reject Amendment No 6.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 7.
The proposed definition is identical in the Gothenburg Protocol.
We must maintain technical consistency.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 10.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Environmental legislation
But what does it matter?!
And how could it be?
It must be observed!
You must do it!
I wish her well.
That is the balance I suppose.
One more word on the habitats directive.
They are seriously late.
I am not suggesting that we contravene legislation.
But let us be clear.
It should not just be an idle threat.
Member States have to comply with European regulations.
You must stick to that.
I would support you one hundred percent.
That was not at all clear.
Let me say two or three things.
You should do that!
Here too we must watch out!
Twelve European countries are before the European Court.
That is what this is about.
We are reasonable.
That is a clear timetable.
That is the decision we have taken today.
This will be a very important tool.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12.09 a.m.)
Maes (Verts/ALE).
50th anniversary of the Geneva Convention - humanitarian law
I congratulate the President for domestic reasons.
Never again.
This is what politicians decided in post-war Europe.
This appeared not to be the case.
Nearly 50% of infants born prematurely die.
The children being born are underdeveloped due to malnutrition.
Millions of people are suffering worldwide.
Iraq is a formidable enemy.
This, I deeply regret.
This was considered helping the UCK!
Surely this is too absurd for words!
There are reports of torture.
There is a vicious circle.
Human rights are indivisible.
This demand has also been put forward here today.
Thank you very much, Mr Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Human rights, racism, xenophobia and antisemitism
The next item is the joint debate on:
Certain basic rights are universal.
We need long-term work, not occasional campaigns.
Thousands of young women suffer genital mutilation every day.
Obviously we need to deal with this.
They are concerned not with opinions but with actions.
They provide protection against injustice and discrimination.
The EU should not be changing or reinventing things.
The aforesaid legal practice is not static.
Fortunately, it is developing the whole time.
The conventions too are constantly being supplemented.
But so too must the present Member States.
Please allow me to make a direct reference.
Meanwhile, the day-to-day reality is disappointing.
Mrs Ludford' s report bears witness to this.
The answer is yes.
Racism is a complex issue.
The Commission needs this aid.
Without civil society we are living in a vacuum.
Racism is not an opinion.
It is a crime against human dignity.
We cannot nowadays simply defend those described as minorities.
Instead we must get them out of this ghetto.
We must teach our children about all of this.
These people have clearly chosen their side.
Legislation against racism must be harmonised.
The words must take on real meaning.
And where does the right to life come in?
And what about the protection of the family?
Racism, xenophobia and antisemitism must be stamped out.
This notion smacks of a naÃ¯ve kind of intellectualism.
(Applause from the right)
We have several basic principles.
Children are actually invisible in the EU Treaties.
Animals have rights, children do not.
We have problems in the candidate countries.
We have to take tougher action.
We have to bring children up the agenda.
Why can we not do the same?
Why can we not do the same?
I know we have communications.
But cultural value patterns underlie these violations too.
I can give you two examples of this.
This really is a case of fundamental rights.
How can we allow some people to be excluded?
This year is especially significant.
I want to make three small points.
Which is the decision-making authority?
That is a question which has no meaning.
Who knows where it will all end.
Religion per se is a factor which promotes fraternity.
Culture is based on values, not colour.
One of these is the issue of water.
Self-criticism is not enough.
In this sense, thank you.
This is where we expect to see progress.
There continues to be a barbarous war in Iraq.
Bombing continues ruthlessly and unreported.
We are not doing anything whatsoever about it.
I condemn such a conservative ideology.
People have to overcome their fears and short-term interests.
What interest would be served in doing so?
These ladies and gentlemen are never present in committee.
Technical work, no thank you.
Simplified rabble-rousing, yes please.
(Applause)
I have identified three particularly characteristic points.
What are racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extremism?
What do these concepts cover?
What are their philosophical origins?
What doctrines do they involve?
Do those accused of these acts deserve this opprobrium?
This is completely absurd.
Who is racist in Europe nowadays?
Xenophobia is the rejection of a foreign presence.
This will not start with you! ...
Neither represent any conceivable threat to the Italian State.
To ask the question is to answer it.
After all, human rights are there for everybody.
There are ten words missing from the Danish version.
He deserves it.
I will give just one example.
This is a very important topic.
That is what this report aims to do.
The EPP's amendments seek to divide families.
They object to family unity.
That is the aim of Amendment No 13.
It deletes that from the report.
Is that what we want?
I do not think it is.
It would be a retrograde step.
I agree with Mr Schulz.
Thirdly, reference has been made to quotas.
Nowhere in this report are quotas mentioned.
As a liberal I am opposed to quotas.
It refers to where we are now.
Regions and stateless nations are ignored.
People within their own communities therefore suffer.
Europe is full of Haiders.
This is already happening.
Vote
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.
This is totally clear.
After the vote:
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Quite right, Mrs Myller.
Before the vote on Amendment No 18
Thank you.
Everyone is now clear on this.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I will therefore put this to the House.
We should keep to what was decided.
Madam President, I disagree with this decision.
Absolutely, Mrs Banotti.
We will make a note of this.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
However, these amendments were not adopted, unfortunately.
Yet it seems that another definition is now emerging.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We have not granted them this labelling on chocolate.
Nothing has changed.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Developing countries are also the victors.
It also does not guarantee the quality of chocolate.
I am therefore not happy about this.
We must demand the following:
This is all cock-eyed.
Stop playing with our food.
Now that would be real progress.
Understand this.
Who would have believed it?
Everyone has different tastes.
.
Consumers require clear and specific information.
They should no longer be deceived.
We can hardly do otherwise.
Consumers should find out for themselves what tastes best.
The answer is clearly no.
The situation was therefore satisfactory.
So why change it?
Not at all.
In fact, quite the contrary.
This is deceitful.
Chocolate lovers, religiously savour your next Easter eggs!
What will be next after chocolate?
Our citizens want to see concrete action.
The debate has particularly crystallised around co-incineration plants.
This report is now before us at second reading.
I believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal.
.
1.

3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.
Considerably limits the present derogations for cement kilns.
11.
Cement kilns are actually subject to strict emission rules.
Plants for unsorted waste require more advanced equipment.
The directive' s objective is commendable.
This latter aspect essentially concerns France and Belgium.
I find the UKIP's hypocrisy breathtaking.
We have just been talking about chocolate.
Davies report (A5-0062/2000)
This is to be regretted.
Myller report (A5-0063/2000)
The rapporteur has proposed amendments to reinforce this proposal.
In principle I can only agree with these proposals.
I feel this is a good compromise.
This is essential.
Motion for a resolution on the Lisbon European Council
This initiative is to be congratulated.
We must firstly set ambitious objectives.
I therefore broadly support this programme.
And rightly so.
Capitulating to China was both immoral and cowardly.
It was cowardly also.
Respect for human dignity must be our guide.
Everyone must be protected from poverty and exclusion.
Everyone is entitled to education, culture and health.
We must declare that poverty will not be tolerated.
Fraternity must guarantee the rights of the poorest.
I believe it has a place here.
I consider this last point to be very important.
The report does not contain what the title promises.
That was Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar' s intervention.
I will now begin my own, Madam President.
The report raises many relevant points.
We also need to address the causes of discrimination.
Roma often live in areas where everyone is struggling.
The Roma' s own contribution is also important.
This needs to be given special attention.
This is praiseworthy in itself.
The death penalty is an example.
Cyprus - Cyprus satisfies the Copenhagen criteria.
But we must help them with training.
The Belder report also states this unequivocally.
I refer to the Russian-speaking minorities.
An Austrian citizen is a Portuguese citizen.
A Portuguese citizen is an Austrian citizen.
That simply is not true.
Let me start with the MalmstrÃ¶m report.
We produced a communication in 1998 on this subject.
We could not work without NGOs.
Broken promises can lead rapidly to bankruptcy.
I will be exploring this in the communication.
These discussions have produced concrete results.
We will persevere with such measures.
We are also open to opportunities for strengthening them.
These reports cover extremely important issues.
I am grateful to Parliament for its timely input.
The bilateral sanctions are therefore exactly that.
It was not by chance at all!
That is quite clear.
These are the Haarder and Ludford reports.
We felt that it was politically possible.
Mr Schulz, we have noted your statement.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Eurodac
The next item is the joint debate on:
This is not a trivial question.
And we have given our reasons.
It started back in Dublin in 1990.
That too was a very positive aspect.
How will the system actually be configured?
I personally take a different view on this.
It is incomprehensible.
The same applies to parliamentary scrutiny.
And believe me, we shall do so.
Are the Council and the Commission so convinced?
That is the task now before the Council.
We should start by harmonising this policy.
We do not want to lose time.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Trade in bovine animals and pigs
We are calling for Article 17a to be deleted.
This is a codecision process.
We have already had intensive discussions.
This exemption has important implications for my country.
Some were implemented, but many were not.
Let me express my surprise and concern about this.
It pre-dates that agreement.
We noticed that.
The legal text is therefore confirmed.
Then we can use the simplified procedure.
It makes no sense to continue with the debate.
That gives clarity to the situation.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Question Time (Council)
We will examine questions to the Council.
Question No 1 by (H-0141/00):
Does the Council concur with that statement?
.
A number of conclusions emerged from this work.
The majority of cases involve women in illegal situations.
Question No 2 by (H-0148/00):
Can these sanctions also be stopped bilaterally?
First of all, there is no Council decision.
This is not a European Union issue.
Different individuals will have different perceptions of all this.
I personally do not like sitting alongside fascists.
Question No 3 by (H-0151/00):
Question No 4 by (H-0155/00):
Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez, you have asked two questions.
Your comments make perfect sense.
Question No 5 by (H-0158/00):
Thank you, Minister.
Question No 6 by (H-0160/00):
How exactly do things stand?
This comes to some USD 40 billion.
Other countries have been paid.
Greece has not.
Why?
Germany has acknowledged its obligation from time to time.
Question No 7 by (H-0162/00):
We are also concerned about this.
Question No 8 by (H-0166/00):
We are not working at Council level here.
This uneasiness is only being reflected in bilateral relations.
We are not confusing Community matters with bilateral matters.
Question No 9 by (H-0169/00):
The current presidency has been following this practice.
Would you accept that principle?
.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(The sitting was closed at 7.00 p.m.)
Mr Evans has the floor.
Evans, Robert (PSE).
Thank you, Mr Evans.
EU-Mexico Interim Agreement
This is hardly a resounding success.
Anything but, in my view.
650 000 employees.
Is this how we are to combat unemployment?
We cannot renegotiate the agreement.
The advantage to Mexico is obvious.
When free trade increases, there are also losers.
Poverty in Mexico has risen rather than fallen.
The second is scientific and technical cooperation.
The EU has kept derogations open for itself here.
Mexico has none!
Some points even contradict the Mexican constitution.
On the contrary!
We are going to talk to non-governmental organisations.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Information society for All
In other words...
We must not forget people with disabilities.
The United States occupies second place.
This must be reflected in the action plan.
Otherwise, it will not properly take off.
But the reality of the matter is somewhat different.
The IT boom is confronted by mergers and redundancies.
History teaches us that this approach has failed.
How can these two things be reconciled?
Data protection and encoding are what we need.
These are two different things.
Information is only a raw material of knowledge.
The information society is the chaos society.
The rest of us should start a counter-revolution.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I do not want to deny this.
The amount is much too small.
Far-reaching harmonisation concerning commercial communication is therefore urgently needed.
How do we measure it?
But are these two forms of backwardness the same?
Will it be a social content or purely market-related?
We need to evaluate them properly.
Technological progress is an all-too familiar slogan.
Improvements are therefore needed here.
Greater account needs to be taken of this.
This locomotive needs rails.
We need a basic legislative framework for e-commerce.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This, I think, should be stopped.
First there is the pragmatic deficit.
And finally there is the investment deficit.
How can we become more competitive?
How can we create new markets?
How can we create permanent, more highly-qualified jobs?
Europe has talents.
Europe has skills.
Occasionally we lack competent directors to motivate us.
Mrs Hieronymi pointed that out.
Schools without computers must become the exception.
Independence is increasing, as is pseudo-independence.
Within companies, responsibilities are changing.
Teams have shorter and shorter sell-by dates.
The significance of e-commerce is difficult to overestimate.
Avoid being so fearful and negative.
Take Mrs Villiers' insights on board.
That would be Europe' s loss.
Your report expresses concern about the smart card action.
The aim is not to disadvantage other technologies.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Vote
(Parliament agreed to the request)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, one other brief point.
I have some sympathy with that remark.
The Commission has not expressed its opinion on that.
I am not going to debate it.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
However, I wanted to point this out.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Concerning paragraph 45:
This a serious translation error.
I feel sure that the Italian is a mistranslation.
I think this is the root of the problem.
The French, Danish and English versions are correct.
That would overcome all the difficulty.
There is no ambiguity, there is no uncertainty.
That is quite reasonable.
Concerning paragraph 61:
It is the English version which is correct.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This is not a legislative report.
So I agree with you one hundred percent.
That hardly constitutes a point of order.
I suppose I cannot win.
I urgently request that you continue the vote.
It is going to be an interesting vote.
The members have already left!
Even the rapporteur does not want that.
That is quite in order.
We have already overrun by 45 minutes.
I suggest that we vote this evening.
The vote will be totally distorted.
This is shameful.
Two specific points.
Perhaps all the members should be reminded of that.
Please let us proceed thus.
Sarah Ludford has stated that she agrees with that.
That is my motion.
There is absolutely no problem with that.
It is well within the Rules.
It can be done immediately before the vote.
It is normal procedure.
That is why I cannot take it now.
That concludes the votes.
Ferrer report (A5-0066/2000)
In other words it is a mini-MAI.
It is a gift to large-scale European industry.
The living conditions of the people have been disregarded.
Joint resolution on the annual legislative programme
We abstained as a group throughout this vote.
We want something more substantial and meaningful.
Duff/Voggenhuber report (A5-0064/2000)
Who was consulted beforehand?
Yes, I did say "the Commission" .
That is quite ludicrous!
But then is that not how Europe usually works?
A Charter could make a positive contribution to this.
We are therefore voting against the whole report.
Our demands are quite clear.
.
Jackson resolution (B5-0227/2000)
These are vital life-line funds for jobs and growth.
That is a laudable and necessary ambition.
MalmstrÃ¶m report (A5-0060/2000)
Obviously I agree with that.
Haarder report (A5-0050/2000)
Hence our support in principle.
We must grasp these new opportunities.
The European Parliament must, therefore, remain vigilant.
This is an issue which requires deeper analysis.
I would, however, add a few caveats.
This section is poorly drafted and ambiguous.
In most cases they are.
And why not?
Freedom is not something that can be decreed.
Not one of them constitutes an actual minority.
.
Perhaps that is what this whole exercise demands.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Topical and urgent debate
Western Sahara
on the Western Sahara.
I am not shocked.
I can understand it.
Direct dialogue between the parties is essential.
Self-determination in Western Sahara is essential for that.
A state of emergency reins in the occupied areas.
The supply situation has deteriorated dramatically.
A referendum was held.
A state of emergency followed.
Morocco is not complying with the United Nations resolutions.
Nor has it confined itself to these delaying tactics.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Mozambique
on the floods in Mozambique.
And what are the nearby African countries doing?
And what about the criticism concerning coordination?
Mozambique has now entered an extremely difficult phase.
It is now a question of rebuilding the country.
The shock must be absorbed and the economy relaunched.
The European Union must never behave like this again.
Mr Van den Bos has also pointed this out.
We most definitely provided support.
Constraints have been identified in this terrible disaster case.
This is not easily done.
In money terms we have contributed quite well.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Human rights
Presidential elections in Peru
on the electoral process in Peru.
War crimes in Chechnya
Freedom of the press in Serbia
Situation in Iraq
on the situation in Iraq.
Situation in Jammu and Kashmir
on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.
Presidential elections in Peru:
But the guarantees are not complete.
That means the guarantees are not complete.
War crimes in Chechnya:
We responded.
It is a scandal and we cannot accept it.
Freedom of the press in Serbia:
This is now happening every day in Serbia.
Dissenting voices are silenced.
Mr Milosevic and his fellow criminals must be removed.
Democracy must be saved.
The result is yet more conflict and violence.
The situation in Yugoslavia is deteriorating by the day.
Tension surrounding Montenegro is mounting.
This ranged from high fines to direct intimidation.
It is increasingly difficult to enter the country.
I find this a dangerous game.
So much is clear.
I am in favour of this.
The EU makes a difference.
But we have already said that.
Situation in Iraq:
Imposed on the Iraqi people I should say.
Iraqis are not going to die of starvation.
So the debate continues and the resolutions are withdrawn.
It cannot continue.
The fault lies with the government of Iraq.
Situation in Jammu and Kashmir:
We have to support all available initiatives.
What we must not do is keep quiet.
That woman was sobbing her heart out.
We must find a solution.
They must come to the negotiating table.
This appears to have awakened world opinion again.
Mr President.
The latest development in Kashmir is worrying.
These issues are also mentioned in your resolution.
This will only prolong the crisis in Iraq.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
Combatting organised crime
Quite the opposite.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
CITES
Re-legalisation would only further reward bad behaviour.
It is about a battle between civilisation and barbarism.
Over-exploitation and misuse cannot be explained by poverty alone.
Besides which, it does not work.
This is scandalous.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
That was our reason for withdrawing them.
Mr Buttiglione wishes to raise a point of order.
Thank you, Mr Buttiglione.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote (continuation)
Let us proceed with the vote.
Before the vote on Amendment 53
Thank you.
We have noted your remarks.
We are not therefore voting on it.
(Parliament approved the motion for a resolution)
I would ask for this to be considered.
Mr Swoboda, that applies to both of us!
We spent a very long time voting on this.
Mr Speroni wishes to raise a point of order.
I am certain it was a problem of translation.
I am convinced of it.
(Parliament approved the motion for a resolution)
(Parliament approved the motion for a resolution)
Most of our group therefore abstained or voted against.
Our reasons were as follows.
I consider that unacceptable.
(Applause)
That obviously violates the Treaty right away.
It is badly drafted.
We abstained on point 10.
.
I think that second category is highly significant.
One other proposal deserves our full attention.
in writing.
This report totally fails to provide a balanced approach.
It is damaging through its stridency.
This report would undermine rather than improve race relations.
That cannot be a desirable outcome.
Stand up and be counted!
But that was not to be.
This is not serious.
Report (A5-0055/2000) by Mr Belder
ECB foreign reserve assets
We know that it sustained a loss in 1999.
Secondly, the ECB should gain in financial independence.
Why?
Yet it is a revealing slip of the pen.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 7.35 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
We take note of your comments, Mr Zimmerling.
This was an unfair comment.
We take note of your comments, Mrs McKenna.
That will not be a problem.
Can I go ahead?
I conclude this from the minutes.
(The Minutes were approved)
Vote
CAP: information measures
We hope that this amendment will be adopted.
Mr President, I welcome this measure.
The common agricultural policy gets a lot of criticism.
Local bodies are better qualified to do that.
Amendment No 10 concerns Article 5.
Amendments Nos 7 and 13 concern contributions.
The funds available are modest.
Amendment No 11 concerns evaluation.
Amendment No 4 concerns administration.
Amendments Nos 1 and 3 concern linguistic nuances.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Grain legumes
However, this has still not been done.
Prices have fallen for just about every product.
This is what some people call stability.
What vegetables are we actually talking about?
There are two conclusions to be drawn from this.
So how could the system be improved?
This is a reference to Amendment No 2.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Additionality
Therefore central government expenditure is reduced.
This is a clear contradiction.
The rules as they stand allow this to happen.
There are too many jobs at stake.
Secondly, he also mentioned their by-election.
I turn to the question at hand.
I thank the Nationalists for having raised this.
But I suspect there is a deeper plot here.
What are they actually trying to achieve?
I listened to Ms Evans.
We should not change that.
That is what we should concentrate on.
We therefore call on the Commission to...
(The President cut the speaker off)
It reduced in real terms by 30%.
So where did the Structural Funds go?
This year we have EUR 29 430 million.
That is simply unacceptable.
'Difficult' indeed, Sir.
So what can we do?
This is clearly not acceptable.
This is clear non-compliance.
I was talking to councils in Wales yesterday.
They need this scheme to go ahead.
We have no Objective 1 funding.
So, why do I speak?
It gets no support from Europe.
Why not?
I think they might win that case.
Their worst nightmares have turned out to be reality.
Commissioner: three questions:
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 11 April.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 10.50 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
It may be worse yet.
The next few hours will tell.
It should read "will never distance" .
Thank you, Mrs Morgantini.
Thank you, Mr Galeote Quecedo.
Something quite astonishing for this type of meeting occurred.
Everyone was quite dumbfounded by this attitude.
Of course, Mr Berthu.
This is certainly a quite regrettable incident.
Mr Tajani, you are quite right.
We do still have two of them, though.
Madam President, I shall be very brief.
Unless we therefore consider that they benefit...
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
Welcome
(Applause)
Agenda
The next item is the order of business.
Relating to Wednesday
Are there any objections to this request?
There do not seem to be any objections.
In that case, this will be the arrangement.
It is your right as a Member of Parliament.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Are there any objections?
(Parliament gave its assent)
Relating to Thursday
It is a sensitive subject.
There do not seem to be any objections.
(Parliament gave its assent)
General product safety - BSE tests
We want to have a more efficient system.
The present situation is in fact far from ideal.
This particular provision is designed to rectify that situation.
The practical operation of the system will be improved.
Madam President, Commissioner.
We know that meat production begins in the stall.
I have quite a few questions.
I have a second question for you.
So all these factors must be looked at together.
Mr President, Commissioner.
I share all the concerns expressed by previous speakers.
Will these tests also be carried out in Austria?
That has tended to concentrate minds very considerably.
What is to be done?
The findings of the report make extremely alarming reading.
Aeroplane "hushkits
Or would they?
So what is the crux of the matter?
Our position, then, is as follows:
It is now a powerful body.
That is all we know for sure.
What can we negotiate?
We can negotiate two things:
.
And we are being firm.
I wonder what he actually means?
It is either one thing or the other.
There is much ado about a great deal.
That is the only reason.
I welcome that and I congratulate you.
That much is clear.
They have given it to us so often.
We should not turn things round.
I believe they should withdraw it.
That is why these concessions were not made.
That was a big mistake.
Consider the example of genetically modified organisms.
It has not even entered into force.
Why should we abolish it?
This was also what my fellow member was asking.
Stand by your guns, Madam Vice-President!
It is contrary to the principle of non-discrimination.
There are no grounds for suspending regulations.
I understand that we must not be inflexible.
There are regulations, we put them in place.
They are good regulations.
Suggest that to them, Madame Palacio.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt was quite right to point this out.
That is a positive development.
We must go further.
There is nothing more to say about this.
That is all.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow.
Mediterranean policy
The first is a general consideration.
This is a general political concern.
The second point is more specific.
And this is a weak point.
We agree to support the civil forum.
I hope I have been clear.
We feel very strongly about this issue.
The Partnership is still far from achieving its objectives.
Mr President, enlargement is essential.
We think that this is of the utmost importance.
I shall now conclude, Mr President.
It should be as meaningful and far-reaching as possible.
Often the final beneficiaries are not the partner governments.
I count on the Parliament to support our efforts.
Regional infrastructure is essential to economic development.
NGOs can benefit from a number of programmes.
This assessment certainly includes some positive aspects.
Thank you very much, Mr Obiols.
Not the opponents of the regime.
It is official.
I hardly need express our pessimism in this regard.
However, this is not just about underlying attitudes.
The Commission proposed various amendments last year.
I think the inclusion of Libya is crucial.
I hope that this Parliament will support it.
The Mediterranean and its peoples need us.
We cannot leave them to struggle alone.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It should be filled with content and not emptied.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration
I believe this warrants some reflection.
This is not the only problem, however.
Let us look at the situation in Iraq.
Whom should we urge to respect human rights?
This modus operandi is unacceptable.
This is totally unacceptable.
Now, how can this possibly be?
I am going to talk about asylum.
This clause is a violation of international law.
Europe must cease to turn a blind eye.
This means cancelling the debt of developing countries.
The only solution must be a brokered peace.
Nothing else matters.
Nothing else will stop people from fleeing the country.
What conclusions can we draw from this report?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an excellent report.
Clearly this is not an easy task.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
2001 budgetary guidelines
Parliament sets particular store by this.
The European Parliament also stands by these commitments.
Allow me to make myself quite clear.
Without flexibility we will get nowhere.
What are the challenges of Activity Based Budgeting?
There is potential for collaboration here.
That is the view of this Parliament.
A number of points have been taken on board.
We must not carry on this way.
We want transparency.
The substance of the Treaty must be implemented.
This, for us, is the crucial approach.
We do not want a Lego approach to enlargement.
This is especially important in relation to linguistic support.
Any changes have to be clearly justified and transparent.
Drafting the budget means spending taxpayers' money.
Only the vital areas can receive public funding.
But the reforms will require cooperation with the staff.
I am all in favour of this.
Nor will my group.
But it is a different story with the Council.
Mrs Haug is not to blame.
Why?
We cannot go on like this.
Does she want us to wear blinkers?
This is not on.
There is another important point in this budget.
It concerns civil dialogue.
Later we will need the commensurate funds.
Thank you very much, Mrs Langenhagen.
Unfortunately, others do not tend to follow suit.
This division of tasks is unacceptable.
That cannot be.
We have stretched out our hand.
Mrs Haug has stretched out her hand.
We can work together.
You should know that.
Take the outstretched hand.
I share this view.
It is the financial situation which dictates future development.
Farmers and politicians fought hard for this position.
We therefore reject it.
We have therefore introduced an amendment to cover this.
This report proposes changes.
This is a very serious commitment.
This morning we discussed environmental protection.
Then it was said that environmental protection took priority.
We must endeavour above all to include small enterprises.
Nevertheless, we do have a fall in incomes.
Now to Mrs Haug' s report.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Combating child sex tourism
Everyone involved agreed on this consensus.
This problem cannot be solved through national measures.
It is about touching people' s consciences.
They are innocent and defenceless and they seek security.
There must be criminal penalties for child abusers.
Much more effective measures are required.
It is an extremely serious problem.
I find that cause for extremely serious concern.
But that is not enough.
This requirement must be abolished forthwith.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Liability for defective products
This is a very good idea.
We need more and deeper study for that purpose.
I do not think it should be prejudged.
Caution and level-headedness are needed.
Millions of cases are affected day after day.
Which is why we have been elected.
It would be dangerous to stifle this by uniformity.
The third principle concerns setting levels of compensation.
These two sets of subjects overlap.
The Commission agrees wholeheartedly with Mr Harbour.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Electricity
We have many reasons to move in this direction.
What must the cornerstones of this forthcoming directive be?
But, on balance, everyone is in favour.
We must recognise that.
We are represented in accordance with the subject matter!
We must make a distinction between these causes.
The distinction is easy to make.
They need permanent protection.
We certainly have no lack of reports.
How can we do this?
Secondly, aid must be degressive.
The report does contain many good ideas.
What can we do about it?
First, the sustainability of energy sources.
Support must be given to renewable energies.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
I want to stress two points.
I have never said that.
Thank you, Mr Berthu.
Are there any further comments?
He did not say that.
Absolutely.
I remember that too.
That will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
Will it be made public?
It is standard procedure, Mr Staes.
This is not a lack of transparency.
It is not up to me to do it.
Quite, Mr Wurtz.
The "Echelon" system
I must stress this very firmly.
It cannot gather this data directly.
I will clarify this for you.
These ideas are still being developed.
I will try to cover most of them.
The introduction of such products is not without complexities.
Let me now turn to data protection.
What is this committee supposed to find out?
Now, we must act.
So what is to be done, then?
Do we want a committee of inquiry?
Do we want a non-permanent committee?
Do we want an own-initiative report?
Not a single word.
That is something, at least.
I have to say I am disappointed.
Is the British Government being open about it?
Is it collaborating in the system or not?
I think we have a right to know.
I am really very worried.
Tongues are being loosened in certain Union governments.
Where is this taking us?
With friends like that, who needs enemies?
Our fellow citizens have been alerted.
We have some irregular espionage practices of our own.
Will you ever go to Sydney again?
Will you ever go to Ottawa or Wellington again?
And we thought there was solidarity in Europe.
But stronger than whom?
Stronger in opposition to Iraq?
In opposition to the Serbs?
Stronger in opposition to nations and nationalism?
Poor old European Commission!
Poor old European Council of Ministers!
Poor old European Union!
We are conditioned by the circumstances of our birth.
This is marvellous.
My third question relates to Article 3.
What have your findings been in this sphere?
We fear and suspect this, however.
I therefore have three questions.
The first is to the Council and the Commission.
This then provided us with the notorious Infopol documents.
I should like to quickly make the following points.
I did do so and I do so again.
Here, there have been programmes for eighteen months.
No companies have contacted the Commission on that issue.
I think this decision is very clear.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the next part-session.
That is the reason why I am here today.
Some oppositions to this patent have already been filed.
This is a flagrant violation of human dignity.
We now see how important these clarifications were.
There is also something else which requires clarification.
Why do I mention this?
Moreover, everyone must adhere to this.
I would draw your attention to two elements.
Firstly, there is the biotechnology directive.
Just imagine that!
This patent is no isolated case, however.
I dispute this.
I agree with him.
I think that the directive is a good one.
Well, President, it is forbidden.
The proper term to use is a Community patent.
We are working on that.
Mr President, I just wanted some further clarification.
Not so.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Vote
A mistake has nonetheless crept into our opinion.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on Mediterranean policy
Concerning Amendments Nos 4 and 5:
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Concerning Amendment No 4:
I think it is a translation-related problem.
The German must therefore read 'verbrauchende Embryonenforschung' .
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
Enlargement will be an expensive business in many ways.
.
The Committee on Fisheries does not want more money.
Ferber report (A5-0068/2000)
There is too much staff-related expenditure.
They reflect political choices our delegation finds unacceptable.
Such trickery deserves to be denounced.
Resolution on "hushkits" (B5-0289/2000)
The noise issue is equally topical in American airports.
That is stressed in the resolution.
This is not a lot of fuss about nothing.
Resolution on Mediterranean policy
The European Union must start facing South!
So we must relaunch that dialogue.
But it has virtually chosen to overlook interregional cooperation.
That is an area which must be developed.
There are still many social challenges to be faced.
HernÃ¡ndez Mollar report (A5-0057/2000)
Why, then, are so many Members critical?
So what is Europe doing?
Klamt report (A5-0052/2000)
All the same, the coincidence is distressing.
That is intolerable!
Amendment No 3 broadens the terms of this measure.
Mrs Klamt has presented a good report today.
We must condemn these practices.
Technology is proceeding faster than individual governments can legislate.
Progress is, of course, being made.
MacCormick report (A5-0061/2000)
Turmes report (A5-0078/2000)
Nowadays, it is impossible to live without electricity.
Do we pay for the air we breathe?
Resolution on the cloning of human beings
That is unfortunately not the case.
On the contrary.
It is human dignity which provides the decisive standard.
This is what the Edinburgh research is about.
Soon we will be cloning our pets.
Where will it end?
There is plenty of money at stake.
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I believe it was very important for this House.
Thank you, Mr Imbeni, for your comments.
I would hope that happened in the European Parliament.
Disciplinary procedures?
(Applause from the left)
Thank you.
(Mixed reactions)
Meanwhile you allow five million euros to be stolen!
Thank you, Mr SeppÃ¤nen.
It is not just a little detail.
I will attend to it this week.
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.
We are now faced with a dilemma.
The Group leaders have heard your points.
I consider this to be extremely serious.
Football is a sport which transcends the world.
Almost every country plays football.
It is known as a beautiful game.
Thank you, Mr Miller.
We shall do so.
This is a very sensible suggestion in my view.
Agenda
Sittings in Strasbourg from 10 to 14 April 2000:
Relating to Tuesday:
Let me turn now to Mr HÃ¤nsch.
Is this what you propose?
So, Tuesday Turkey, Wednesday Ethiopia.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Relating to Wednesday:
Yes, of course.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Relating to Thursday:
Yes, I think that is clearer.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?
It is okay to have five points.
Thank you for that.
It is up to the House to decide.
I think we are all in agreement.
So, I have the proposal regarding Zimbabwe.
(Parliament gave its assent) Relating to Friday:
I do not think that would be a problem.
(Parliament gave its assent)
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
Child pornography on the Internet
We have been short of a definition until now.
We want to stamp out this appalling abuse.
I believe that we have managed to do so.
We have had nothing but positive contributions.
This will hopefully lead to better investigations.
All children should have the right to a childhood!
That ought to be a basic human right.
This obligation must have legal implications.
This in turn requires extremely advanced technology.
This is the key to prevention.
The Internet itself cannot commit crimes.
95 to 97% of the Internet is legal.
It is a high-quality text.
This is simply lacking.
In fact, his name fills us with hope.
The NGOs are doing a great job.
Communication technologies transform data.
Interpol has acknowledged having a file of 800 photos.
Why are these valuable documents not used?
To govern, however, means to make plans.
This is an irresponsible attitude.
For example, in the area of trivialising homosexuality.
It is the originators we must combat.
(Applause and mixed reactions)
The report is therefore on the right track.
Children are taking on various ages in this Union.
We welcome the debate on the age limit.
Actions must follow.
He beautifully tars everyone with the same brush.
Then it all sounds so wonderful.
They spout their poison and then push off.
On this point, Mr Hager is correct.
These are all points underlined by Mrs Plooij.
The Internet has the aura of progress.
This is a problem.
I truly welcome this debate.
My second point is the age limit.
It cannot be set high enough.
16 is just the first step.
The target must remain 18.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
European Refugee Fund
All refugees begin with a dream of returning home.
The Commission is obviously on the right track.
The second objection is more extensive.
The Commission is on the right track.
So the proposed review process becomes essential.
Asylum-seekers are not a burden but a responsibility.
The asylum policy urgently needs a European approach.
However, perhaps this is also happening elsewhere.
Mr President, my Group welcomes this proposal.
I agree.
We saw the need during the war in Kosovo.
We therefore support these motions.
We shall here mention only three points.
That contradicts the basic intention.
Those are three different areas of work.
Financing must be ensured up to 2004.
This proposal raises many questions.
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Electronic money institutions and credit institutions
(Rapporteur: Mrs Kauppi)
The Commission took a similar view.
We therefore welcome the directive.
What are we talking about here?
We will monitor this.
This must change!
However, I am thinking primarily of consumers.
That is very regrettable.
This does not make sense.
It is also good news for financial institutions.
E-money does not mean that money is created.
We want those rules.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Animal nutrition inspections
There are ample examples to prove this.
Scandals can have a cleansing effect.
It immediately drew lessons from the dioxin crisis.
He is evidently more optimistic than I am.
Such is life!
And what has the Council learnt from this?
So what has it learnt from the BSE crisis?
Has it learnt that rapid action is needed?
It has learnt none of these things!
I consider this common position to be scandalous!
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Food additives other than colours and sweeteners
We are effectively working with a positive list.
What is being proposed today?
I shall mention them quickly.
We must consequently reject this one too.
Finally, three other additives are proposed as propellants.
That is a brief overview of the problem.
I have counted around fifty of these myself.
Others should be used far less widely.
This raises a few questions.
We cannot do a bit of both.
I should like to point out a further problem.
This makes stale carrots look fresh.
What consumer interest is served by doing this?
The substance is not useful to the consumer.
One of them is there only for professional use.
The other two are regarded as safe for all.
But its meaning remains crystal clear.
It is being done in the consumer's name.
For that reason we commend Amendment No 2.
What are we discussing here?
The question answers itself.
That is the prime consideration.
Our proposal is based on three main principles.
Therefore, in those circumstances, it is justifiable.
Mr Lannoye mentioned the application of the precautionary principle.
Our decisions ought to be science-based.
That is a factually incorrect statement.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting closed at 9.20 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
Could the EPP Group please get its act together!
(Applause from the left)
I should like that to be corrected.
It shall be done, Mrs McNally.
Thank you for your understanding.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Applause from the right)
Vote on request for urgent procedure
.
It is planned for our agenda in May.
We can leave this until next month.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
1998 discharge, budgetary control
Section IV - Court of Justice
Section V - Court of Auditors
Section VI, Part B - Committee of the Regions
Section VI, Part A - Economic and Social Committee
All the cases are awaiting a decision.
There has been no whitewash.
That is another difference in the discharge procedures.
We have already discussed them at length.
We have received every document written on the subject.
The inventory has been addressed.
Mr SeppÃ¤nen addressed it yesterday.
So what exactly were Parliament' s requirements?
This is moving in the right direction.
What does the Committee on Budgets mainly want?
This is something which the Commission could undertake itself.
I think it is about time this stopped.
The Committee on Budgets, therefore, recommends discharge.
We are expecting a report on this.
There is something else.
The Commission has promised to assess this.
.
What does the Commissioner intend to do about this?
Has the Commission ever taken legal action?
Or does it intend to?
I would like to have these questions answered.
We are prepared to grant discharge under these conditions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Then there is still the staffing problem.
You addressed this point, Mr van den Berg.
This Commission has no fear of any findings.
I expressly state that I agree with number 4.
The Commission notes this proposal with interest.
This alone would considerably improve this instrument.
We are working on that.
Mrs Schreyer also mentioned it.
This includes reappraising old cases.
The rapporteur quotes four cases by way of example.
We shall have to debate this.
Excuses and promises are no use.
We need clear proof of improvement.
We check their accounts.
We ensure that policies have been well managed.
That was clearly used as a political battering ram.
Mrs Stauner quoted Goethe.
I will quote Shakespeare.
We do not want witch-hunts.
We are voting for postponement on many accounts.
It is always greatly appreciated.
This was already mentioned last night.
We must not get ahead of ourselves.
The documents disappeared everywhere simultaneously.
Secondly, we would like proportionality explained.
Should large businesses pay larger fines than small businesses?
Thirdly, where does the Commissioners' responsibility lie?
This is an extremely political issue.
Then Parliament would know where it stood.
Europe' s ideal needs to be preserved.
We need clear-cut criteria and clear-cut guidelines.
Mr President, the European Union lacks moral authority.
That is particularly problematic in matters of finances.
It is not that there are no rules.
National states provide development aid, so does Europe.
National states combat racism, so does Europe.
And so on and so forth.
No.
No.
No.
You operate on the principles of absolute monarchy.
Firstly, on the question of the Parliament discharge.
I come to two points here.
The first is access to information.
Why?
Parliament is not getting the answers it requires.
Secondly, the question of the disciplinary procedure.
It is an arbitrary procedure.
I do not share this view.
We are the controlling body.
We have the direct link with the citizen.
We should outstrip them by far.
Unfortunately, nothing is further from the truth.
Mr Kuhne has completed an excellent piece of work.
But Mrs Morgan, this is not happening.
This is no longer the exception.
The price tag is FFR 27.4 million.
This is ludicrous!
He is blaming us for playing a party-political game.
The Stauner report deserves every support on this score.
These shady tricks must stop at once.
Why such a steep rise?
A clarification regarding this drastic rise is urgently required.
This is the umpteenth affair involving new buildings.
They are not the only ones.
Documents must not disappear.
I will give you an additional piece of information.
It is a general debate.
Of course we must.
However we must not compare separate issues.
That is not the case.
I should like to give an example.
It was sent to the Commission in November.
I hope the Commission will take our demands seriously.
The Commission' s delegations have failed.
I look forward to seeing the results.
This is both embarrassing and distasteful.
I was perfectly aware of its importance.
As are we.
Then everyone will have a true picture.
Questions can hurt.
I thank Mrs Stauner for her report.
I would not entirely accept the explanatory statement.
The procedure needs to be completely overhauled.
However, these suggestions do not go far enough.
I would ask the Commission to reconsider its position.
In this respect, the report has been improved.
These are the three positive features.
This gives us grounds for concern.
Mr President, thank you for letting me conclude.
We need better access in order to move forward.
That is right.
Unfortunately, these problems have not been solved.
This merits further attention too.
OLAF must use its teeth.
The committee has now changed this, albeit informally.
Mr Mulder, you also returned to this point.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Vote
Before the vote:
Bolkestein, Commission.
Before the vote:
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Before the final vote:
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Before the vote on the amendments:
I am sorry but it is too late.
The request was not submitted in time.
The Rules are very clear.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES
Staes report (A5-0084/2000):
At the time, several problems had been identified.
Obviously, this is extremely reprehensible and even irresponsible!
Lannoye report (A5-0072/2000):
Usefulness for the consumer is a particularly vague concept.
Finally, there is the criterion of harmlessness.
There are still loopholes!
Kirkhope report (A5-0090/2000):
The Internet operates across national borders.
The twenty-first century is the century of communications.
Frahm report (A5-0091/2000):
It means "distributing the burden" .
That concludes the vote.
It was certainly a turning point.
AntÃ³nio Guterres' handling of the debate was exemplary.
The Lisbon debate generated substantial agreement on most issues.
It is our duty not to let them down.
I will borrow the words of the Presidency.
Let me utter a few words of warning.
It will not be.
Let me issue a second word of warning.
We are on the threshold of enlargement.
Here is a riddle.
We want sustainable development in all these aspects.
(Applause from the left)
The first point is the strategic goal.
The second point relates to employment.
This is also true of the Monti package.
I cannot however be delighted by it.
This applies to both positive and negative aspects.
I am not aware of any European social model.
The real problem is being completely ignored.
Paper is cheap.
Unfortunately there is a total lack of concrete results.
We are all familiar with these requirements.
But implementation is where it falls down.
Judge the Austrian government by its deeds.
(Applause from the right)
That is our challenge.
It is action not words that is needed.
Do not worry, it is meaningless.
It is a question of strategy really.
It is a strategy which is radically innovative.
The most basic example is employment.
This is the simple yet great idea of Lisbon.
Such cynicism borders on candour!
Mr President, I welcome the Lisbon conclusions.
Partly that follow-up is institutional.
Will it, in fact, be largely intergovernmental?
If so, I think we will be disappointed.
We are also concerned about the substance.
We need a clear programme.
We have to tackle that reform of the Treaty.
We need deeper knowledge in science and technology.
The sixth framework programme will be another tool.
We need to use the knowledge in better ways.
We also need new sustainable technologies.
This goes beyond socialism, this is pure Marxism.
Her remarks fit this depressing tradition perfectly.
Congratulations, Mr President.
First of all, Mr Blair.
This is a problem too.
We have listed a few problems.
We also hope that they will implement it efficiently.
It needs to be done locally.
We must not allow that to happen.
The e-commerce document springs to mind, for example.
This is an existing document.
This intention was formulated a long time ago.
This is very serious.
Secondly, social security.
Do you remember?
This is its strength.
E-commerce is not a separate end in itself.
This begs another comment on Lisbon.
You must understand that this is a network.
That is clear.
This is the potential significance of Lisbon.
The debate is closed.
.
Some progress was made on this issue too.
We have already seen some good election results.
Peace can bring prosperity.
Clearly commitments made a decade ago have not materialised.
40 million African children today are not attending school.
They have no toilets.
But that man' s wonderful dreams were lost.
But none of this is the key issue.
And why not?
Because no destination was established.
The next objective was Socialism, the fair-haired comrades.
Black Africa was supposed to turn red.
For the Africans it was a negative outcome.
An interparliamentary assembly, like that of the ACP.
I disagree with him on this.
Commissioner Nielson also said something to that effect.
Nonetheless, an EU-Africa Summit is to be welcomed.
The figures speak for themselves.
These are policies that have never worked anywhere.
Quite the opposite.
We must support democrats unreservedly.
Europe thus has a moral debt towards Africa.
But who notices that here in Europe?
Some think it is a missed opportunity.
Such a step is significant.
You cannot develop the African people from within Europe.
A new framework such as this really creates opportunities.
Ordinary, regular contacts cannot work miracles.
They should become the norm.
I would like to add one more point.
This is my maiden speech in this Chamber.
.
I would like to clarify a few points.
Why was this the case?
It also covers the Caribbean and Asia.
Another important point is debt.
The summit is not an international financial organisation.
This represents a complete U-turn in this area.
It was time to put right this delay.
It had never been done before.
It was the first time.
We took that step.
I have discussed AIDS in Africa with President Mugabe.
I appreciate the support from Parliament to that effect.
I wish that were true.
This should be part of international economic governance.
They got along quite well.
They certainly developed quite well in those two days.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
External relations package
It is a very practical document.
Inertia is only part of our problem today.
The rapid reaction facility responds to these needs.
The facility is a kind of quick-start package.
It is not an ideal solution.
I have a question pertaining to his first point.
There is an image problem.
It is one we address in the communication.
Mr President, Commissioner.
I concur with Mrs Maij-Weggen' s question.
What sort of timetable should we be working towards?
I have enough anecdotes to justify my impatience.
It is an extremely valuable contribution.
We will keep in touch with them.
We can manage EUR 30 or 40 million.
It is much needed.
It is very difficult to compartmentalise these crises.
Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement.
I strongly welcome this rapid reaction facility.
The question of coherence is very important.
I am thinking again of the role of ECHO.
I recognise the case for coherence.
The honourable Member is entirely right about that.
There are differences.
The practical implementation is the difficult bit.
Would the Commissioner agree with that?
I agree with the honourable Member on that point.
That is unacceptable.
The stores down there are empty.
Where was ECHO?
Absolutely nothing has been done.
I just wish to add two points.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Question Time (Commission)
We will examine questions to the Commission.
First part
Question No 34 by (H-0306/00):
Can the Commission explain the reasons for this non-participation?
Will the Commission insist on its right to participate?
I certainly do not think that is an issue.
Thank you very much, Mr Patten.
We therefore wish you a good afternoon.
Question No 32 by (H-0293/00):
The Commission departments have made such information available.
Question No 33 by (H-0298/00):
.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
No applications have been filed.
That is the drawback with this variation.
Question No 35 by (H-0307/00):
There is also the question of Internet pornography.
In Romania there are no people paying for it.
Now let me come to Romania.
Not that I am saying that it is untrue.
Simply that we cannot confirm it.
Question No 36 by (H-0289/00):
Second part
Questions to Mrs Schreyer
.
.
This is the Rule in this House.
Question No 37 by (H-0272/00):
This is a disgrace for European agriculture.
This is a disgrace!
A disgrace!
Does the Commissioner agree with that?
We have examined this carefully.
Question No 38 by (H-0287/00):
The absurdity of this system is becoming increasingly apparent.
Questions to Mr Kinnock
The Commission is currently updating this analysis.
I hope that we can count on your support.
Thank you for your answer.
Thank you very much, Mrs Schreyer.
Question No 40 by (H-0332/00):
I thank the Commissioner for his reply.
.
Question No 41 by (H-0342/00):
How do you plan to address this?
Questions to Mr Byrne
.
We thank Vice-President Kinnock for his replies.
Question No 49 by (H-0284/00):
The Swedes have since changed the rules.
I should like to thank you for your answer.
I thank the Member for her supplementary question.
The way Question Time is run is not acceptable.
Firstly, it does not start on time.
That makes it impossible for Members to be here.
How are we meant to function in this way?
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Situation in Turkey
.
We are working in the right direction.
The ball is in Turkey' s court.
Commissioner Verheugen has just recapitulated these expectations.
Mr Birdal advocates peace.
I am glad the Commissioner stressed these.
To say this is not to be anti-Turkish.
Will not other Turkish citizens benefit also?
Including Turkey.
I should like to list a few examples.
Why are arms being delivered to Turkey?
There is a very lively debate in the country.
That is very important.
Perhaps we are seeing something new being born.
But the old legal system is still there.
They certainly want membership.
But we need more precision from the road-map.
Turkey has made none.
Have they still not managed to do so?
Is that such a drastic step?
It was one of disappointment.
Commissioner, you mentioned the interministerial committee.
Except that they do nothing.
I warned you about that.
Changes need to be made here.
But no, this is not the case.
And in politics, false realities produce false results.
.
No!
Nobody said that!
And this is something upon which we agree.
Turkey has merely been recognised as a candidate.
We are, therefore, at an exploratory stage.
We are only just preparing the pre-accession strategy.
I therefore advise on a little patience here.
The debate is closed.
Deliberate release into the environment of GMOs
Many aspects worry me.
Take the example of genetic transfer.
All we hear about are Frankenstein plants and superweeds.
I have a key witness here.
I think it is important for health reasons.
One controversial issue is producer liability.
Anything else would amount to
What will happen if it does not do so?
We need a clear ban here.
Is that your sop to the genetic engineering industry?
My last point concerns genetic contamination.
We regret this toning down.
The biotechnology debate requires an integral ethical approach.
We believe that God created the world.
I believe we can do so without destroying biotechnology.
Firstly, antibiotic-resistant genes must be phased out.
That is only right.
It is fair.
This is not acceptable.
Firstly, the protection of public health.
Secondly, the commitment to international agreements.
This is not possible in conventional agriculture.
Tinkering with genes holds unknown risks.
The Christian Democrats are playing a dangerous game.
We are already lagging far behind other countries.
But nor can we demonise it.
We must address those very real issues.
What are the risks?
How do we best avoid possible negative effects?
This will provide clarity for complainants and prevent loopholes.
It must be seen in that context.
A phase-out is already foreseen in the common position.
The Commission agrees to strengthen this political message.
This is both for administrative and legal reasons.
This concerns in particular the plant breeding industry.
Amendment No 32 is therefore not acceptable.
I just want a yes or no.
I should like a clear answer on this.
I am not reopening the debate.
Commissioner, do you wish to reply?
.
That is why we cannot accept Amendment No 42.
Your views are also welcome.
I intend to ensure that this paper covers GMOs.
It already covers product liability.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Identification, registration and labelling of beef
So we are talking about an extremely complex operation.
I believe that we have managed to achieve this.
I propose that we change this system.
Consumers want information, not a novel.
We shall have problems explaining this to consumers.
It is only a matter of four months.
Mr President, beef labelling has two distinct functions.
The two should not be confused.
The need for information sprang from the BSE crisis.
We should not go down this road.
Why do we want that?
My last point is to end where I began.
The postponement adopted is not lawful.
This system has proved very effective.
It has made it possible to restore consumer confidence.
The Member State of origin must therefore be indicated.
This is a good move.
The amendments will be adopted.
It is high time we took action.
This must be our ultimate goal.
We will then be where we need to be.
We simply need this.
I agree with this.
Take the example of summer pasturing in the Alps.
The Commission thinks it should.
The background to this is the food crises.
This is often a matter of taste.
In my opinion, we should choose another approach.
The internal market is a large entity.
The principle of mutual recognition is fundamental.
This is unacceptable in my view.
All EU Member States need to guarantee safe meat.
But it should not be an EU stipulation.
One of those words is "slaughtered".
I want to sound a note of caution.
I have a number of concerns.
The first is: who pays?
It has not been borne by the retailer.
I have one further question of the Commission.
Is it wise to renationalise the beef market?
Or even to regionalise it within countries.
I seriously question that point.
I challenge the Commission tonight to answer that question.
Is this a wise move?
The Commission is able to accept 18 of them.
That concludes the debate.
(The sitting was closed at 12.10 a.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mrs Ludford.
Thank you, Mrs McKenna.
Madam President, with rather more levity.
Could we find out why this has happened?
It is so embarrassing.
I want to express my solidarity with them.
Thank you, Mrs Laguiller.
I will give the letter my utmost attention.
(The Minutes were approved)
IGC
Mr Ribeiro e Castro will present the motion.
The very essence of Europe is under threat.
Thank you, Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
Thank you, Mr Berthu.
I call on Members to vote against this motion.
The EU countries have completely different cultures.
Some countries have a different system.
We have recital 15.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has already mentioned that there are amendments.
(Laughter and applause)
(Parliament rejected the procedural motion)
The Intergovernmental Conference attempts to answer just that question.
I refer very specifically to closer cooperation.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos mentioned flexibility.
We want a statute for European parties.
The European Union is not a State.
This is another task as I see it.
It is all part of the same package.
The European Union is a Community of values.
None of them is currently operative.
This is not currently the case.
Our third demand relates to competition policy.
I would like to raise two points.
My second point concerns energy.
We owe this to our citizens.
I believe that this results in satisfaction all round.
There are nonetheless two points that are lacking.
Maybe we will do so in future.
There is no justification for this in our eyes.
It strengthens economic and social conditions.
How does it do this?
Its collegiate nature must be preserved.
This augurs well for the success of our work.
That is what we need.
That must not be just on paper.
It is measured by the degree of legitimacy.
We support the main thrust of this report.
We must create a fully democratic institutional fabric.
We cannot create an Amsterdam 2.
This is precisely the issue.
We must adopt a more positive approach.
Asset stripping is a punishable offence.
We parliamentarians have been side-tracked.
Join us in SOS Democracy.
We would like to make three points.
Secondly, the importance of transport.
.
The report is clear and comprehensive.
I have two comments to make on the report.
And success is what we need in Nice.
These changes are essential to the success of enlargement.
But we also proposed two options on that basis.
Negotiations on these issues have scarcely begun.
I think that is a good thing.
The first point concerns European defence.
The European Union Defence Ministers met on 28 February.
We can see that today.
One could say that these principles are self-evident.
That is a question of terminology.
Let me say a few words on this.
But who would seriously suggest that?
We have to start out from what we have.
I hope to present the results in May.
(Applause)
Next is the number of MEPs.
The third point concerns the issue of unanimity.
We would also thank the Commission for this support.
Here we must consider ourselves to be small.
Leftovers are thrown in the bin.
The euro is to be introduced.
We have heard this before.
Quite simply, the EU must become more liberal.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
We are overloading the wish list of the IGC.
Our priority is enlargement.
We should not confuse or reverse our priorities.
Mr President, my group welcomes this report.
The Commission cannot go on expanding indefinitely.
It is ambitious.
That is essential for our future.
VOTE
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(The President declared the common position approved)
Simplified procedure without report:
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
(The President declared the common position approved)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
WallstrÃ¶m, Commission.
(Laughter, Applause)
Thank you, Mr Liese.
May I remind you that the debate is closed.
It is that very common position.
He does not seem to agree with you.
I can only regret that.
There were eight votes to go.
I quite understand your feelings, Mr Bowe.
To tell the truth, I agree with you.
Some Members had left the Chamber, others remained.
But I too am sometimes faced with imponderables.
You yourself are a member of the Bureau.
(Mixed reactions)
For it is unacceptable...
(Applause)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on the Lisbon Summit

(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Resolution on the additionality principle
This matter urgently calls for review by the Commission.
I am very glad about that.
Paragraph G is inaccurate.
Agricultural statistics for the period 1993-2003
Checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road
My first point relates to liability.
My second point relates to antibiotics.
This is most disgraceful!
The same goes for the issue of genetic pollution.
Parliament has caved in on this too.
There are major issues at stake.
Nothing of the kind has happened, however.
That tells us something.
to impose a strict liability system on producers.
I want to issue this warning today.
Further delays would be a mistake.
The Directive guarantees a high level of protection.
Nothing is so enduring as the accidental.
This will ensure that other species are protected.
Papayannakis report (A5-0088/2000)
Lisbon European Council
The Lisbon Summit created enormous expectations.
If only these promises could be fulfilled.
On this score, only the future will tell.
Yet we already regret certain weaknesses.
EU-Africa Summit in Cairo
Frankly this does not appear to be the case.
Our President exceeded the rules of protocol.
IGC (continuation)
There is no point in trying to deny anything.
This confusion will lead to conflict year after year.
Progressiveness cannot only be based on expenditure.
I listened to Mr Segni' s speech.
This is the real challenge.
We are the representatives of the people.
First number: 700.
Second number: two thirds.
We must create a formal symmetry.
Third and last number: 2009.
So what is different?
The answer is everything.
What a frightening idea of democracy!
I shall concentrate on these.
1) One Commissioner per Member State.
3) No Europe-wide lists.
The distance from the voters would be too great.
Party financing may be misused.
Suspension is a serious measure.
There is a need for wording of this kind.
Of course we can only be delighted at this.
It is most important to incorporate that Charter.
That is the nature of democracy and democratic decisions.
It is a question of legitimacy and acceptability.
It is a question of equality and solidarity.
IGC 2000 is not the end of the story.
Europe is at a crossroads.
The IGC should therefore make up the democratic shortfall.
This is provided for in Amendment No 162.
A community of law must uphold its own law.
What does that make us now?
The accession negotiations are now under way.
We must strike a balance.
In my opinion, we need more than that.
That is not something to be proud of.
Moreover, we cannot sit on all the committees.
I believe that our report is more serious.
I warmly congratulate the rapporteurs on their work.
We hope that certain amendments will be approved tomorrow.
My second point is directed at the President-in-Office.
Congratulations, Mr President-in-Office.
Madam President, this is an extremely interesting debate.
Parliament must be a driving force in this.
That is not on!
We have not struck the right balance yet.
The European Union is not just an economic community.
We are also a community of values.
We have an excellent report for voting on tomorrow.
I would expressly like to commend them for this.
This point is very important.
President Napolitano proposed the idea of an interparliamentary conference.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Famine in Ethiopia
The decisions were also taken at the right time.
We are monitoring this issue.
It is a lethal mix.
That is the frustration.
They will be making recommendations on our future efforts.
The real figure is more than three times that.
That is the background.
It is important to be aware of it.
I hope that letter gets wider circulation.
It is important to remember that point.
This quantity should be sufficient to meet immediate needs.
So that is what we are doing.
We are also considering using the Port of Sudan.
They will have our unstinting assistance.
Who does one negotiate with in such a situation?
When I was there they were pleading for help.
According to them, we are entirely to blame.
They are jointly responsible.
My second point concerns food.
Is there anything for sale locally in the region?
It is not easy.
Ethiopia and Eritrea bear the ultimate responsibility.
Millions of people are again threatened with starvation.
This is not just caused by extreme drought.
We should nonetheless not lose hope.
Nature can only destroy where people fail.
Why do we still allow this to happen?
Do we not have a conscience?
So how can we be surprised at this situation?
It is not true that we show solidarity.
No.
I am not saying anything new.
When will we have a Marshall Plan for Africa?
Yet we cannot relax.
Starvation and death continue today.
The population of Ethiopia pray for rain.
Sadly they see only a rain of bullets.
People crave water, food and medicine.
These measures are palliative.
This must be made clear.
Thank you very much Minister.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Stabilisation and association process for countries of South-Eastern Europe
This concludes my general comments on the Funding Conference.
First of all, the funding.
He finally came up with EUR 530 million.
What is the progress here?
Fourthly, the NGOs.
Finally, the distribution of tasks.
.
We must now swiftly regain lost ground.
We must be on our guard here.
Elections are no panacea.
One cannot vote democracy into being.
This will cost money.
The court judgements are not even being implemented.
So what are these issues?
So what are they?
A domino effect.
It is a bet which must be won.
Otherwise, these will not happen.
Croatia is currently the main object of our attention.
Croatia has experienced a political watershed.
That much is clear.
However, we also need the appropriate mental infrastructure.
Mr President, I will make three points.
We have first and second wave candidate countries.
I would, however, stress certain points.
The sooner we do this, the better.
It is causing serious harm.
And who can lift it if Europe does not?
We must find the courage to take this step.
Then there is the issue of crime.
Yet there was a great deal of similarity.
It is important to be clear about that.
For agricultural products the figure is about 0.16%.
I have spoken before of my concerns about Montenegro.
About EUR 350m of that will go to Kosovo.
People say that is a crazy figure.
That could only start once Milosevic has gone.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
We will examine questions to the Council.
Question No 1 by (H-0255/00):
Question No 2 by (H-0286/00):
Question No 3 by (H-0299/00):
If anything, things are worse.
But no more!
And not just that.
But that cannot happen.
Mr Theonas wishes to rephrase his question.
That was my comment.
In fact, quite the contrary is true.
This is very clear to me.
For goodness sake!
Mr Korakas, I must make a confession.
I cannot make this any clearer.
Question No 4 by (H-0294/00):
These are clearly administrative issues.
He specifically referred to two monasteries.
Question No 5 by (H-0262/00):
I want to thank him for his answer.
This situation is unfair.
You refer to the KLA.
In fact quite the contrary.
A more effective result has not been possible.
Question No 6 by (H-0279/00):
.
What is hiding behind all that?
That does not happen anywhere, it is unreasonable.
The Council presidency has no knowledge of this issue.
There is a specific body responsible for this administration.
The European Union is not a country.
Question No 7 by (H-0274/00):
This too involves the principle of subsidiarity.
I want to thank the Council for its answer.
What happens in the future is important.
This is the answer to your first question.
Question No 9 by (H-0275/00):
The European Union must be progressive.
I must always be objectively honest.
Question No 10 by (H-0276/00):
Mr President-in-Office, I thank you for this reply.
They were not able to before.
Question No 12 by (H-0277/00):
These structures were established on this date.
I would thank the Council.
I am nonetheless a little surprised at the answer.
Question No 13 by (H-0283/00):
This is why they signed the Treaty.
Thank you very much, Mr Seixas da Costa.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(Loud applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Democracy is always a painstaking business.
(Loud, sustained applause)
Mr President, we have now heard you.
Our vigilance is not partisan.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause.
Uproar on the far right)
Financial services and complementary pensions
What is included in these measures?
What is intended through these measures?
Thirdly, granting the Commission broad powers of interpretation.
We could not agree more.
Firstly, the barriers are not identified.
What exactly does that mean?
I would appreciate a reply to this.
.
That covers the general framework.
The communication from the Commission is liberal-minded and forward-looking.
This increases choice and diversity.
In committee there was lively discussion on biometric risks.
Freedom of choice is emphatically a good thing.
What was bound to happen has happened.
It is challenging the civic foundations of European construction.
Supplementary assurances are therefore a problem.
A full-value pension scheme covers biometric risks.
This leads on average to higher returns.
What are pension funds?
(The President cut the speaker off)
There is a reason for this.
I think he deserves tribute for this.
This also includes small and medium-sized businesses.
Two arguments are in order here.
But we should not establish a system today.
That would constitute misrepresentation of the product.
That would do our cause no good at all.
The key word is "supplementary" pensions.
And what is the truth?
It is time to change the tune.
What do we understand pensions to mean?
(The President cut the speaker off.)
We should keep intervention to a minimum.
I think that two issues still need tackling.
A second moot point is that of codetermination.
People need time to make these provisions.
These are the European Commission' s twin objectives.
It is an important remark.
This is a very important matter.
The report will be made available shortly.
But how exactly can this be done?
Should we make more use of comitology procedures?
This is beyond dispute.
This coordination is a precondition for cross-border labour mobility.
I believe that this is not right.
This freedom remains.
The Commission is acutely aware of this.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Strategy for Europe' s Internal Market
What was that message?
What does the internal market mean to European construction?
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The Member States must cooperate in this application.
This new version does contain specific measures and proposals.
Liberalisation presents other difficulties.
I invite colleagues to reject that proposal.
I hope that is appreciated.
The Council has been dilatory in many areas.
I would like to highlight some of these points.
This is why information campaigns are essential.
Back to basics should be our motto.
Superfluous legislation should be withdrawn.
I believe that there has been a little confusion.
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has mentioned three topics.
This is tied in with the economic culture.
I happen to disagree with these critics.
Responsibility lies with both camps.
And he is right, of course.
This is certainly not the intention of this Commission.
This could not be further from the truth.
The internal market is far from complete.
Let us hope that this will change.
This would actually unblock half a dozen directives.
We are all waiting for this moment.
Mr President, this concludes my remarks.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
2001: European Year of Languages
.
This is a terrible observation to have to make.
The European Year of Languages is important and worthwhile.
Language is the most peaceful way of communicating.
Independence is language and language is independence.
Language is a powerful force.
It is the most important bond for a nation.
It is a means of occupation.
What better rapporteur could there be?
Now it tends to be English.
Let me just briefly mention a few points.
Languages reflect the diversity of the European Union.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Youth
Young people are Europe' s future.
The new programme is more comprehensible and more citizen-friendly.
This report had a long gestation period.
We will always ask for more money.
The budget is not enough.
But we can be pleased with the outcome.
I would recommend that we support this programme.
It is a very good report.
We hope that imbalance will be redressed.
I hope that does not happen.
That is an excellent initiative.
That is what this programme is intended to achieve.
Thank you very much and the best of luck!
I offer them my thanks for their work.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 12.45 a.m.)
Principles for recording taxes and social contributions
This is a serious issue which has been debated.
Two questions still remain, however.
Ladies and gentlemen, what is done is done.
This change is a complicated change.
This is certainly a step forward.
Overall, this is a useful step forward.
I welcome the commitment of the Commission.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
COM in bananas
, rapporteur.
The stakes are high.
We need to know what our objectives are.
Why should it be any different for bananas?
That way we can finish on time.
But let us give them time.
They will then become competitive.
It seems that the Council cannot easily accept it.
Parliament does not like it either.
However, the Commission proposes many other things.
After bananas, will other sectors fall?
This clearly remains an open question within the WTO.
We support his report.
Well, it is not enough!
The United States wants more.
Technically, what does it want?
What is Europe doing to face that challenge?
It is divided and getting bogged down.
We are divided from our German friends.
Another four years, Mr American executioner!
And we have tabled amendments too.
It is regional policy that is at stake.
It is cooperation policy that is at stake.
Sanction for sanction, retaliation for retaliation.
The banana is a moment of truth.
The reason for that is simple.
I congratulate and thank Mr Dary.
Is the Commission not guilty of double standards here?
That will lead to poverty and even more deprivation.
Yes, we have to simplify the system.
It is far too complicated at the moment.
Yes, we have to find a solution.
The challenge should be to reform the WTO.
This should be the European Union' s policy.
Mr President, I speak from three perspectives.
I regret various aspects of this Dary report.
That is essential.
I support the Commissioner's efforts.
He has a difficult task.
That is the official position.
Mr Schwaiger recognised this a moment ago.
That really would be demanding the impossible.
If prices fall, subsidies automatically increase.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
I shall suspend the sitting until the President arrives.
Vote
I also have to reject Amendment No 5.
Almost every member of the committee spoke on this.
They are radically different.
That is why I tabled this amendment.
Is that correct?
on Amendment No 5
After the vote on Amendment No 5
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
before the vote
before the vote
These amendments make reference to the Secretary-General.
I am not expressing an opinion on their content.
Parliament has not yet voted on them.
on Amendment No 4
on Amendment No 1 from the Greens/ALE Group
There is nothing contradictory at all about this.
(Parliament adopted the decision)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
on compromise Amendment No 224
Presumably the English version is "more proportional".
We cannot accept that word.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
But I have to apply the rules.
A compromise amendment has been put before me.
I put the question to Parliament.
I thought that was the case.
That is the simplest approach.
on Amendment No 118 from the Greens/ALE Group
Madam President, the French text takes precedence.
Right, thank you for making that clear.
on compromise Amendment No 227
on Amendment No 174 from the PPE Group
Is that right, Mr Brok?
So it would be easier to do that here.
Is that right?
That is the old text.
We cannot split this again now.
That is clear.
I proposed a solution in both cases.
before the final vote
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
(Loud applause)
By way of explanation, consider the following quotes:
We chose to abstain and this requires explanation.
We think not.
We are against such an approach.
So we have chosen to abstain.
Kuhne Report (A5-0097/2000)
Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen Report (A5-0086/2000)
That is clear.
But we know that.
I am confident that we can do that.
We were very near to a compromise agreement.
We should be able to crack this one.
Mr President, I have voted against this report.
I say this with regret.
We find three points in this report particularly harmful.
Why not a European Parliament of 1000 Members?
This agenda is, of course, too restricted.
There is nothing of this, however.
Otherwise, the whole system will implode.
I have therefore voted against.
This is why I voted for this amendment.
Enlargement means more States' representatives in Parliament.
It imposes forced privatisation.
That is why we have voted against this report.
There are other excesses in this veritable shopping list.
Unanimity cannot be limited to constitutional decisions.
, in writing.
Therefore,
We will therefore be voting against the report.
That concludes the vote.
I do not remember Mr Berlusconi being present.
Topical and Urgent Debate
Iraq
Over 200 children die there every single day.
This is not acceptable.
We cannot allow this to go on.
It is the ordinary people who suffer.
We cannot allow this to go on.
That is absolutely unacceptable.
We have no reason whatsoever to doubt their veracity.
I too have met some of these people.
I have shared their suffering with them.
But what a contradiction.
What a tragedy.
And that is essential.
This is important for all of us.
Their minds are under attack as well.
There are no books.
There are schools but there is no paper.
There are doctors, but there is no medicine.
It is perverse.
They were promised food in exchange for oil.
Do not keep silent!
Do not be accomplices!
UN officials are resigning.
They must be released from this poverty.
I appeal to your consciences!
Europe is denying itself!
We certainly cannot continue to accept this situation.
And here I differ slightly from Mr Collins.
Remember, the Iraqi people are innocent.
He decided to resign.
Mr President, our resolution is very consistent.
I had the opportunity to visit Iraq last month.
I met the families of the Kuwaiti prisoners.
The debate is closed.
Chechnya
Mary Robinson obtained limited access.
We have a global responsibility to defend basic rights.
This illustrates that there are various movements within Chechnya.
What proportion are we talking about?
This is unacceptable.
Perhaps stopping the massacre of women and children?
Perhaps stopping the bombing of hospitals?
Please explain this to us.
We have had enough of excuses of this type.
This joint delegation needs to set off without delay.
That is what we should condemn.
The debate is closed.
Human rights
Jewish prisoners in Iran
Akin Birdal
Tibet
Zimbabwe
Jewish prisoners in Iran
God willing, that is what we shall see!
The trial is taking place behind closed doors.
Three have been freed on bail.
So it is imperative that we react.
The youngest is only sixteen years old.
Our feelings are as strong as our concern.
We must make ourselves perfectly clear.
But the trial opening today only involves the Jews.
They were put on trial for it and hanged.
Who are the accused?
What are they supposed to have done?
No one really knows!
That was refused.
That was also refused.
Up to now that has been refused.
I agree with all the previous speakers.
The reason: espionage.
Yet again.
The Jewish communities are afraid.
What is likely to happen?
Either that or they are used for cattle trading.
It is very worrying and must be followed up.
Akin Birdal
He must be released immediately.
Those were Akin Birdal' s words.
Akin Birdal is a gentle and peaceful man.
It is real provocation.
Akin Birdal is not a Kurd.
And yet he has had to endure great suffering.
When will this end?
Tibet
Point one: Tibet must become a peace zone.
How did a Tibetan delegate put it?
Tashi delek!
Eight years ago I was rapporteur on Tibet.
A great many people are involved here.
Death penalty in the United States
Things are changing in the United States.
This is by no means an enviable record.
There is a presidential campaign under way.
Mr President, my Group firmly supports this resolution.
Zimbabwe
This could take up to three months.
This would show real transparency.
African countries must work together to consolidate their future.
I particularly highlight land issues.
The court rulings were ignored.
Land reform is necessary.
It must, however, take place lawfully.
One can think of a whole range of things.
In my view, Zimbabwe deserves our confidence.
The population has chosen the path of development.
With this in mind, we support the resolution.
I believe that we have a reasonable common position.
The elections are therefore necessary.
The rule of law is necessary.
This is what is happening in Zimbabwe.
The American authorities should be expecting one.
Finally, Zimbabwe.
Like the European Parliament, we utterly deplore them.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
World education forum
on the World Education Forum.
A prominent African leader made a very pertinent comment.
This underlines the seriousness of the problems.
I am pleased with this resolution.
Make resources available.
This is also our message to the Commission.
Human beings are born in a state of dependency.
Defenceless, babies have no duties.
They cannot have any.
Duties follow awareness and awareness awakens with education.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Taiwan
on Taiwan.
China reacted furiously.
That is indeed the case.
Is that a threat to China?
The Taiwanese have shown that.
Do they really think their threats will bring results?
As Europeans we do not need to interfere.
These results alone mark a historical turning point.
Nevertheless, everyone involved was aware of the circumstances.
The region needs security and stability.
Healthy relations are also needed for economic development.
Unfortunately, democracy is not infectious!
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Relating to the joint resolution on Iraq
This is an oral amendment.
Are there any objections?
The request has to be made by 32 Members.
(Loud applause)
Thank you, Mr Swoboda.
Mr President, I think we should vote.
Let us proceed to the vote.
Relating to the joint resolution on Chechnya
Everyone has agreed to this specific proposal.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Vote (continuation)
No, it has not changed.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Perhaps you could let me know later.
It would save time if you tried that first.
Mr President, do you feel young?
I think you are saying that you do.
.
Our young people are Europe's future.
GraÃ§a Moura report (A5-0099/2000)
GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm (ELDR).
This statement is thoroughly valid for lesser-used languages.
All of them are already bilingual.
Foreign language learning is indeed the key to integration.
Lasting commitment is needed.
Dary report (A5-0093/2000)
Maes (Verts/ALE).
The problem, however, is the price.
Lagendijk report (A5-0069/2000)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
Negotiations are currently taking place with Macedonia.
GarcÃ­a-Margallo y MarfÃ­l report (A5-0059/2000)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).

We regret that our amendment was not approved.
Kuckelhorn report (A5-0053/2000)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
The opposite is true of course.
.
Subsidiarity and free choice require this.
Palacio Vallelersundi report (A5-0098/2000)
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
COM in milk
This amendment to the Regulation must be made.
What does 'efficient' mean in plain language?
What will the situation be then?
So what is this all about?
Why?
So we have introduced an interim stage this year.
Is that logical?
Surely you can see that.
Why not 'weary women' as well?
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
COM in milk
I found that remarkable in itself.
This has been borne out by studies.
The European Commission has also commissioned a study.
That in itself makes for a stronger case.
You must also be realistic.
That is a good thing.
I myself am a great supporter of school milk.
The proposals before us definitely militate against that.
There are two possibilities.
We all acknowledge the aim here.
It is to cut milk subsidies.
Let us be clear.
That is the reality of the situation.
I am not proud of that.
It is an indication of our deprived status.
This is not unique to my nation.
Sadly, it affects other nations as well.
These are the buzzwords now in the European Union.
Yet they have already diversified.
They have already become as multifunctional as humanly possible.
Defending communities is far, far more important.
The Agricultural Committee deserve every support in this regard.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The European Union should take that on board.
It is good value for money.
We do not always achieve that.
I want to thank Mr Maat.
I think it is complete nonsense.
We should instead award subsidies per pupil.
It is not just beneficial to farmers.
Children do not need so much fat.
The school milk scheme concerns health and nutrition.
I do not think so.
The Union should develop its policy within this context.
We do not wish to be part of that.
Thank you for your attention.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
Vertical Restraints
I should now like to ask a few questions.
I feel this is especially problematic.
These are Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 8.20 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
...
I wish that to be placed on the record.
(The Minutes were approved)
It will be included in the Minutes.
Vote
(The number of Members present was counted)
They have had their little pleasures, Mr President.
I am now giving the floor to Mr Schulz.
We do have individual opinions within our Group.
That is nonsense!
(Applause)
Mr Schulz is right.
This is completely immoral.
We cannot go on like this.
Needless to say, we will discuss this matter.
I think that goes without saying.
I still have many requests from Members to speak.
Four MEPs have left the chamber.
We are now working within the Rules of Procedure.
The doors will remain open.
This is not the case.
Mr President, I think it is genuinely important.
I appeal to the delegates to end their demonstration.
Nobody acted upon this.
This will cause some irritation.
(Applause)
That is not a serious way of doing things.
That can hardly be called frivolous.
This is not the way things are done.
Would you like to get the quorum checked now?
My second point is an appeal to the delegates.
We can monitor all corners of the Chamber.
I am now giving the floor to Mrs Flesch.
Information and communication
The honourable Member also mentioned modern technology.
That must be taken into consideration.
We have a very committed commissioner in Commissioner Reding.
This situation is getting worse.
It is getting worse right across Europe.
Why is this so?
Why this lack of enthusiasm for the EU?
I fear we are doing neither.
Let me just suggest a few possibilities.
We must make more and better use of it.
I can watch the US Senate on television gavel-to-gavel.
But not the European Parliament.
I am not anti-Strasbourg.
I am certainly not anti-France.
This goes hand in hand with efficiency.
The Commission has long had an office there.
That would be a disaster.
That really must be taken seriously.
This means information and propaganda from above.
Public accessibility is just as important as information.
It has one Internet connection.
We thank you for this.
I do not think that it was!
Thank you, Mr President.
May I first answer Mr Perry.
He said that the situation is getting worse.
That is a very negative way of seeing things.
Probably, the honourable Member is right.
That would be terrible.
We have to act.
Mr Perry has addressed three specific points.
Firstly, the website address should be better known.
I know about this problem.
However, I leave that initiative to Parliament.
I consider it very important.
Of course, I cannot intervene in that respect.
It is a private decision of the media.
The information office in Edinburgh will not be closed.
This is a joint effort.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I share the concerns of Mr MacCormick.
I would like this to be recorded.
I am taking note of this.
This will be taken care of.
Let us not enter into discussion.
Mr President, our action is not finished.
This is what we are doing.
Deliberation is always possible.
Where are they then?
Night flights and excessive noise
What has been done to regulate aircraft to date?
All this is in the pipeline.
The vote will take place after the debate.
We talked about hushkits not so long ago.
But what is meant by night?
Mr President, so what needs to happen?
This means thorough research into low-noise engines.
This means bans and international standards.
What is worse?
It is an improvement, but not a solution.
I am looking forward to her reply.
When will this happen?
This would be some achievement.
But this is not the case at all.
These three matters genuinely require urgent consideration.
Let us hope that it will improve.
In addition, provision of information is poor.
Then the legislative framework is also fairly complicated.
Does night start at 10 p.m. or at midnight?
This is something to be taken into consideration.
In short, we are simply shifting the problem.
Technically speaking, the problem is not that enormous.
The question is whether this long wait is desirable.
I do not think so.
We cannot allow this to continue.
Munich and Berlin-Tegel limit night operations to mail freight.
I will not bore you with the details.
You have the documents in your possession.
It has committed itself to precise deadlines.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Are you moving this on behalf of your Group?
This was the speaker against.
I am giving the floor to Mr Blokland.
Mrs Buitenweg, we are voting at the moment.
We are going by the Rules.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I do not consider this acceptable.
Even then a vote is fully valid.
Mr Posselt, you are absolutely right.
The legality of this vote is thus beyond dispute.
I am speaking on a more general note here.
This will not help us any further this morning.
This is clear enough, I think.
Let us move on to the next item.
The forestry sector after the December 1999 storms
The issue is wider than that.
Did we actually intervene?
Did we employ the means available to us?
The question has been put to you.
What action are you going to take?
These are not virtual instruments.
The matter is urgent.
The vote will take place after the debate.
We will expect proposals for solutions soon.
The time has come to move on.
This involves three things in particular.
The citizens are calling for immediate action.
We support these legitimate claims.
So what has become of these famous practical proposals?
Commissioner, I know what I am talking about.
I am a farmer.
You can see that.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Commissioner, you have been extremely active this morning.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Declarations of vote and other declarations
This latter point is especially grave and reprehensible.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I am extremely concerned.
That is the real question.
We shall be a laughing stock throughout Europe.
It is disgraceful.
That was the formal declaration of vote.
It is true that some have left.
And this is why the problem has arisen.
But they went too far.
You then have to respond accordingly.
Matters proceeded as was established.
The votes which were carried out are proper votes.
So thank you.
Nevertheless, we must stop trying to hide...
(The President cut the speaker off)
This amendment was rejected by a large majority.
I feel truly ashamed.
That is how all this came about.
These resolutions are not legislative.
Thank you, Mr Posselt.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Thank you, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
I have taken note of your proposal.
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.
We will have the same situation on Whit Monday.
It is important to know about this matter.
Thank you, Mr Miller.
Thank you, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
Thank you, Mr Ribeiro.
Withdrawal of Mr Le Pen' s parliamentary mandate
Mr Le Pen, would you like to speak?
You will see that it is a serious matter.
This is what Rule 7 states:
(The President cut the speaker off)
I really cannot let you speak any longer.
It is quite out of the question.
(Mixed reactions)
I have the greatest respect for my position.
That time is up.
Review of the financial perspective
I would regard that as the wrong approach.
I think that this is a genuine problem.
I will conclude with my third question.
And that is what it has done.
In fact, these appropriations are urgently needed!
This item is closed.
Vote
Thank you for that clarification.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
PesÃ¤lÃ¤ report (A5-0081/2000)
Maat report (A5-0074/2000)
.
This is the situation in 2000.
This is an unacceptable proposal!
.
.
.
There are several arguments for doing so.
Trans-European networks (1998 Annual Report)
Anyway, now on to more serious matters.
However, this is not its main aim.
Nonetheless, the problem still remains.
He proposes increasing the budget funding.
That is why we need this redeployment.
Studies alone, however, are not enough.
Good communications are a vital necessity in these areas.
They have not done so.
In fact, they have achieved nothing.
Perhaps the people who are protesting are actually right.
Why are only estimates available?
Like the rapporteur, I am disturbed about this.
The people of the region cannot understand that.
They did not do so.
The environmental situation in the Alps is particularly problematic.
Something therefore needs to be done in this regard.
Let me make two final comments.
Madam Vice-President of the Commission.
What we need is cross-financing.
I think that would give us sound financing.
We have a massive problem with north-south transit.
This is a good sign.
There are few better or equally good ones.
Let me give an example of this.
You say that some projects are being delayed.
I want to make this very clear.
On the contrary, there is an absolute will.
These partnerships will be promoted in various ways.
That programme will cover the period 2001-2006.
I would like to make this very clear.
Does this affect France?
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
European airline industry
Is that in any way related to aviation?
These are questions which we are still left with.
Important steps still need to be taken after liberalisation.
No mergers have taken place.
What do we do then on our own?
Secondly, intermodality is highlighted in my report too.
As a result we now have substantially more competition.
It enhances individual mobility.
My position is fairly clear on this point.
This is dominated by three issues: firstly safety.
Common standards and inspection agreements boost safety levels.
This should not be restricted to the EU.
A fat lot of good that will do them.
This is a step in the right direction.
Mr Sterckx has included environment in this own report.
They are increasingly faced with delays.
We have reached the limits of growth.
Another issue to be resolved is the age limit.
Mr President, aviation is undergoing turbulent times.
I support him in this.
Competition also leads to lower costs.
It is vital to guarantee their rights.
This too needs to be regulated.
I shall begin with the medium term.
Eurocontrol does not work and that has been proven.
I think we will be happy to endorse that.
We must go further in this regard.
I now turn to the short-term aspects.
I would finally like to mention some basic points.
And maybe it will.
On the contrary, the situation will deteriorate.
Greece is a typical example.
This is extremely important.
The question of noise is also a serious problem.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Appointment of senior Commission officials
There are clear imbalances.
At least that is what I think.
In fact I would only diverge on one point.
These figures are accurate as of 27 April 2000.
Mr President.
It has all gone quiet now.
We have precise data.
The rotation system is clear.
I am speaking up today as a Dutch national.
Surely this position could not be any clearer?
What should we make of it?
In our opinion, we really need new standards.
This is what we asked the Commission for.
The Commission was willing to produce these new standards.
That is a mammoth task.
It is clear that we continue to support this.
This discussion would be meaningless.
This is the question we need to ask ourselves.
I feel this should be acknowledged.
We must realise this.
Finally, let me say a word about equality.
I supported the submission of the question.
That is a serious problem.
The fact is that Commission reform is going ahead.
Thank you very much, Mrs Morgan.
Most have submitted theirs.
That to me is modest.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Legal aspects of electronic commerce
I still have criticisms about many of them.
Here the Commission has already given the appropriate instructions.
No amendments!
Yet it was a carefully considered decision.
That is a good balance.
It is, of course, global.
We should also take care to provide coherent legislation.
Confidence is essential.
There are many opportunities but what of the threats?
E-commerce is in its early stages.
Our rapporteur has given us an extremely good basis.
I have some sympathy with Commissioner Bolkestein here today.
There is the lack of skill in these technologies.
So essentially this is the core principle.
That essentially is what we have here.
It is therefore a balanced proposal.
It is now an economic and political imperative.
I would warn against complacency.
Parliament works significantly faster.
After all, court proceedings are drawn-out and costly.
I would like a reply to this question.
Without consumer confidence, e-commerce is going nowhere.
We are witnessing a new industrial revolution.
The absence of legal infrastructures is holding back development.
I do not think so.
Europe continues to trail behind the USA in e-business.
Yet we have a real chance to catch up.
We must give political support to this trend.
Many thanks!
That will send out a clear signal.
So there is no reason to delay.
Speed on this occasion is of the essence.
We should not forget that the Internet is international.
My second point concerns cultural assets.
I think that is not good enough.
I am a little out of breath.
There is competition with regard to speed and innovation.
This has also been acknowledged by various MEPs.
Some Members are left feeling not completely satisfied.
This is understandable.
This is, of course, true.
He has spoken about the trade in pharmaceutics.
Those restrictions also apply to selling via the Internet.
The risk is there.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Food Aid 1999
.
But let me add a few general comments.
That is very important indeed.
That is feasible, in any case.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Aid to uprooted people in Asia and Latin America
This is a very urgent matter.
It is four months since it expired.
Mr President, it seems simple.
Sound annual evaluation reports are lacking.
The European Union must help where it can.
Nothing more, nothing less.
The other side of the coin is also true.
Hoarding does impoverish.
I welcome the recognition of this.
So where have they got to?
However, he is only speaking for himself.
Now let me come to the fourth amendment.
I want to make that commitment unequivocally.
There have been references to the new regulation.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11a.m.
EC-Switzerland agreements
He has produced a very coherent opinion.
It is a step in the right direction.
EEA membership was rejected in a Swiss referendum.
Bilateral agreements began to be drawn up for Switzerland.
There is a simple reason for this, however.
That is a major advantage for both sides.
They have no say as regards its content.
That is something the European Parliament could organise.
I would very much hope we could do that.
We want closer cooperation in Europe.
We want more dialogue.
That should set us thinking.
In Austria, Mr Haider resigned on 1 May.
The agreements are very important.
They did that in October last year.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11a.m.
Financial assistance to Moldova
Industry is still underdeveloped and unevenly distributed regionally.
This, however, is not enough.
My report was unanimously adopted in committee.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
The people once again find themselves living in poverty.
Many young Moldovans are looking towards the European Union.
It seems that the direction is not always clear.
It has become a ragamuffin state.
No nation can live and function like that.
Our Group supports the rapporteur' s views.
Moldova is still living proof of this.
However, I have two questions.
Could the Commission be specific about this?
Moldova is today experiencing general migration.
In our view, there is no difficulty.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Combating counterfeiting and piracy
Perhaps I do not need to point this out.
This is why these rights must be protected.
It can be dangerous to health.
It can certainly be dangerous to innovation.
It can be dangerous for the future of research.
This is not a victimless crime.
These must be kept separate.
It is vital for intellectual property to be protected.
They are two different things.
I would like to see us draw distinctions here.
One needs a trained eye to do so!
Moreover, let us not be naively optimistic.
Let us be serious about this.
We do well to put the emphasis on prevention.
This report has come not a moment too soon.
It is a sound report.
The figures tell a different story.
There is big money in illegal counterfeiting and piracy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Transitional civil administration/peace accords
There is a very long history behind this.
Parliament is firmly in favour of this.
What have we noticed happening in the past?
That is what I call a conflict of interests.
More information is required in this area.
There are positive features to be mentioned.
Against this background, we support the Laschet report.
The first concerns Category 4.
Category 4 is already overloaded.
Another problem concerns competence.
How much did the military intervention cost?
How much did the destruction cost?
Milosevic is still in power.
Kosovo is a ravaged country.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the European Parliament.
Vote
The European Union is no exception.
Carraro recommendation (A5-0118/2000)
Well!
So pensioners are responsible for everything that goes wrong!
This led to the signing of bilateral agreements.
This represented a minimum guarantee of coherence.
.
Schierhuber report (A5-0105/2000)
Laschet report (A5-0111/2000)
Let us make no mistake!
Hatzidakis report (A5-0076/2000)
Sterckx report (A5-0075/2000)
These are the negative results of liberalisation.
They make this quite clear on a regular basis.
.
Fourtou report (A5-0096/2000)
This is only right and proper to my mind.
We must face facts.
Damage to the economy is much more significant.
Increasing penalties might also have a deterrent effect.
They introduce distortions of competition.
They undermine the foundations of a sound economy.
That concludes the voting.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
- Thank you, Mr Oostlander.
Agenda
Relating to Thursday:
At the moment, we only have four.
I believe we are all united in this fight.
There are no substantial differences between us.
Thank you, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Thank you, Mrs van der Laan.
We are Europe' s most important country.
We are simply the best.
Just look at who won the Eurovision Song Contest.
Thank you, Mr Blak.
Mrs Banotti will reply immediately.
Madam President, this is becoming a regular item.
We were not getting interpretation throughout.
Mr Blak will explain it to you.
The first possibility is to scrap Friday sittings altogether.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I just wanted to point that out.
Madam President, on a point of order.
This must be a first!
We really cannot tolerate behaviour of this kind!
I wanted to highlight these two aspects.
(The last vote was held after 12.00.)
I only hope that you will understand this.
I support the action in this sense.
In fact, there is no question of sabotage.
I will be very brief, Madam President.
I cannot therefore put this request to the vote.
Agricultural prices
Nothing more, nothing less.
The budget will stick to this principle.
But that is not the case!
The same applies to moisture content in cereals.
The Berlin agreement must continue to be our benchmark.
This is purely accidental.
These combined outbreaks have cost the European budget billions.
Agricultural prices change particularly quickly.
This happens in many instances.
Will it be extended?
What is the intention here?
Will they step up their fight?
Thus the subsidies end up becoming a white elephant.
(The President cut the speaker off)
And how are these millions going to be used?
And you have our support.
We are speaking from the bottom of our hearts.
I congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her report.
I hope that these reforms do take place.
That is why I cannot accept this proposal.
It does not present a particular problem to farmers.
I now come to Amendments Nos 6 and 7.
Some clarification is probably called for here.
However, this was rejected by Parliament.
We will commission a study of this kind.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Flax and hemp for fibre
We all know what happened to short flax.
People have overstepped the mark.
I am thinking of dashboards and bumpers for cars.
I would like to end on a historical note.
There are no great differences between them.
Thirdly, the use of certified seed.
That is why the Commission was right to intervene.
You know what procedure this is.
It gives farmers time to adapt.
That would be "far out" of place!
The proposal before you today has three main objectives.
You see we are not under any illusions!
The Commission has carefully examined Parliament' s amendments.
Nevertheless, problems could arise in some areas.
I can accept Amendment No 6 on hemp.
But the actual objective is clear.
Our policy for the sector has to be unambiguous.
This principle also applies here.
The second important subject is the national guaranteed quantities.
A reform of this sector is absolutely essential!
I think that you agree with me on this.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
Civil liability and motor vehicles
Commissioner Bolkestein, a draft fifth directive already exists.
The fifth directive is therefore already in the pipeline.
Sometimes the process dragged on for ages.
That is a very big step forward.
You overcame resistance from within your own Commission.
Mr Rothley has announced a fifth directive.
That is a clear case of discrimination.
But that is not the case.
They relate to the different areas of Italy.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
Development cooperation with South Africa
The Council finally presented its proposal.
The first question refers to commitology.
Both amendments seem well-considered.
The Council accepted nearly all of the amendments.
Of course, the rapporteur also referred to this.
We thank you very much for it.
We are clearly in a very serious situation.
Decisions need to be made.
We cannot risk delay.
That would be endangered.
Let us be clear what we are talking about.
Mr President, South Africa has enormous potential.
Half of South African households are classed as poor.
The European Union needs the same generosity of spirit.
Would the Commission be able to answer that?
Surely we cannot continue to work in this way.
There is another reason to feel ashamed.
I think this is disgraceful.
Poverty is an injustice.
We want the reconstruction of Kosovo.
This is unethical.
We also support the second amendment.
Free elections have been held.
The time has come to say enough is enough!
There has been a misunderstanding.
That concludes the debate.
(The sitting was closed at 8.50 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
We should leave it until next month.
Thank you Mr Wynn.
That is a very sensible opinion.
It might be helpful to verify this.
It cannot take it away from Bosnia.
It cannot take it away from Kosovo.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
2001 Budget - Parliament' s estimates
That is the wrong way forward.
That is the right way forward.
His report was never released to Members.
That is a very long wait.
It is important that we plan and prepare.
There is a contradiction in the rapporteur's argument.
It also confuses the roles of the organisation.
I think that we should really re-think the system.
I am not against this increase, in principle.
We shall see, in time.
But not in this case!
This paragraph does Parliament no credit.
We are in agreement and we are very happy.
We congratulate him wholeheartedly.
We must initiate the preparatory administrative measures.
We therefore support all Mr Ferber' s amendments.
The challenge which faces us has been described.
And it is needed.
No, preparations need to be made now.
Naturally, this is expensive and time-consuming.
What is more, that may be an underestimate.
I shall explain why shortly.
I am not saying that we have done that.
This applies to the European Union as a whole.
I broadly welcome Mr Ferber's report.
The decision will be taken for us.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Presentation by Commission of preliminary draft budget for 2001
Commission.
So now a few figures on the overall budget.
What does this mean for the European state quota?
There are very positive growth prospects here.
What is the European Union spending its money on?
Of course this will be followed by intensive debate.
So far so good.
We can support that.
But what about Parliament' s priorities?
That is perfectly normal and we have supported that.
I would have expected it to be higher.
Information and communications have risen by 4%.
We are all dying to see it.
Thank you, Mrs Haug.
I will give you an example.
Once again that would be a challenge for Parliament.
But that is not for next year.
That is for the future.
Some of us are starting to become annoyed.
I request that this be put to the vote.
Thank you, Mr Dell'Alba.
(Parliament rejected the motion.)
I welcome this judgement.
That was my position from the outset, incidentally.
Three points on the content of my report.
The legal basis for this is in place.
The development of OLAF is well under way.
Point number 3 concerns really effective disciplinary procedures.
This provision has never been applied.
That would be precisely the wrong signal.
We urge the Commission to reconsider such a move.
That cannot work and it does not work.
(Applause)
This process should therefore be speeded up considerably.
.
First was the issue of definition.
My final point concerns the accession countries.
This opens the door to fraud.
The issue should not be taken lightly.
But that is where our efforts should be concentrated.
Because worthlessness soon turns into helplessness.
OLAF starts its first full working year this year.
Expectations are naturally very high.
This anomaly must be resolved without delay.
The other paragraphs are about something completely different.
Let us take the proposal for an independent Prosecutor.
She did not succeed.
This is not a proposal for a legislative initiative.
So I would adopt a more cautious approach.
What are we not allowed to see?
What is the ombudsman not allowed to see?
Finally, we should not duplicate responsibilities.
I would like to highlight two.
Allow me to congratulate you on this report.
That is the truth of the matter.
That has now been cleared up.
These situations have happily been overcome in Europe.
I do not agree with all of his report.
Reform of the Commission is now under way.
I am very impressed with the reform plan.
In general, it is both visionary and realistic.
That is indefensible.
Mr Blak, allow me to apologise officially.
You are quite right, you had three minutes.
I was not wearing my glasses.
Do you wish to add anything else?
No?
Thank you Mr Blak for overlooking my error.
They always get big coverage.
It may be that he measured his land incorrectly.
There is a huge difference between these two things.
We need to have them distinguished much more clearly.
It is about time they signed up.
They have had five years to do it.
Let us see them ratify it.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Vote
We would be happy to vote.
Mrs Schierhuber, let us be clear on this.
(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)
The Commission has not changed its position.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES
Rothley report (A5-0130/2000)
I was the victim of a road accident.
This matter is now resolved.
This is 500 000 too many.
MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez report (A5-0114/2000)
Thank you, Mr Martin.
They may then hear some interesting information.
Thank you, Mrs Cauquil.
Jeggle report (A5-0115/2000)
.
Aid should not be reduced for the wrong reasons.
Schierhuber report (A5-0124/2000)
.
.
BÃ¶sch report (A5-0116/2000)
Naturally I support this fight.
There are, however, a few sticking points.
That is indefensible.
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
It has now presented it.
So far you have presented no proposal on this.
That is precisely why we are proposing this measure.
This would cost a great deal of money.
I sincerely hope so.
I also want to thank Mr BÃ¶ge.
There are, however, also many more examples.
There are therefore two things which must be done.
Everyone must be treated the same.
I am thinking of the last intervention.
The United Kingdom has been affected badly.
This is therefore to be welcomed.
These are cardinal amendments, to my mind.
We therefore oppose the Commission proposal.
Mr Happart left us and Mr Pagel died.
Why not?
Why?
Firstly, protection is always led by the states.
Secondly, the precautionary principle means safeguarding nations.
Medical and scientific uncertainty still prevails.
This is nothing new.
No public health policy should ignore these factors.
We should wait to see what this inquiry says.
I think this is not a tenable position.
So this regulation is a good one.
We still have no tests for live animals.
Of course we need that.
We are not legislating just for Great Britain.
I will be the first to support it.
What must the Member State do to qualify?
The principle of this approach cannot be faulted.
This is working.
Cases of BSE are declining rapidly.
Whole-herd slaughter has no scientific justification.
That would be a drastic approach.
However, I accept Amendment No 52.
That is the advice I have been given.
I identify cats here in particular.
Thank you again for your cooperation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Organisation of working time
Indeed, we finished up with a nine-year period.
Thank you, Mr Provan.
My thanks go to all of you.
The power of codecision proved to be decisive.
Certainly it was meant to be.
That will not have strengthened our case.
That was an important point of progress.
The second point concerns sea-fishing.
A further important point might have been missed.
Maybe the Commissioner has some news for us today.
I would agree with Philip Bushill-Matthews as well.
I would like to talk specifically about junior doctors.
We have to stop that drain.
The progress of others will be monitored very carefully.
They have played an important role.
I hope that this will continue.
Young and old have different needs and different abilities.
The declaration was therefore a great help to us.
That is the problem.
I have one question for the Commission.
It is now up to the Commission.
The Transport Council is behaving badly.
More of this later.
I call for a similar exception for share-fishermen.
One does not exclude the other.
The results are acceptable.
We cannot support this report as it stands.
That was unfortunate.
I shall come back to this point.
I should like to pay tribute to the Commission.
Parliament made most of the running.
This was no mean feat!
We have discussed this in the past.
I will try to clarify it.
I am afraid I was not clear enough.
That is very clear and very precise.
It is very much appreciated indeed.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Reviewing aid to third countries
That is an embarrassingly large figure.
They have had to operate with extremely difficult procedures.
We have put forward a number of proposals.
That is for the future.
In my judgement it is simply not an option.
We have to do better.
We are not bidding for a bigger empire.
I am sure this will be a long debate.
This is the situation as we see it.
What will happen to humanitarian aid?
I actually wanted to put my question to him.
That goes without saying.
ECHO is going to continue.
This is clearly part of what we have decided.
This is a well established discussion.
I noticed your choice of word there.
This is the message.
I realise that.
But there are other elements around.
We have to say it Ã  tous azimuts.
It is absolutely necessary to make these measures clear.
Development ministers are not that unproblematic either.
This is our biggest problem.
That is not the case.
This is the goal.
Question Time (Commission)
We will examine questions to the Commission.
First part
Question No 32 by (H-0433/00):
What action did the Commission take?
These efforts by the Commission will continue.
The question will, however, have been recorded.
Question No 34 by (H-0357/00):
If so, in what way?
I would, however, like to add something.
Question No 35 by (H-0411/00):
What information does the Commission possess on these incidents?
Thank you Mr President.
Their inspection was carried out under its auspices.
That is what I wanted him to clarify.
Question No 36 by (H-0415/00):
Second part
Questions to Mr Solbes
I am happy to respond to Mr Korakas.
So how are we to deal with this situation?
Are you going to increase them?
I also say this from a Mediterranean standpoint.
Question No 37 by (H-0409/00):
There are also other factors.
This should also bring benefits for savers and investors.
What kind of large budget?
This would lead us into a very complex debate.
What has happened with the euro?
Question No 38 by (H-0419/00):
Questions to Mr Verheugen
The latter proposal won the day.
Thank you for your comments.
Question No 39 by (H-0352/00):
It is really quite simple.
So there is nothing to thank the Commission for.
With which candidate countries has most progress been made?
Which chapters have been completed?
But this happens on a regular basis.
Your question is based on a misunderstanding.
That has been done.
They come at the end.
In all events, the process is proceeding apace.
If there were, I would know about it.
But there is not.
Question No 40 by (H-0388/00):
What transitional arrangements have been agreed to date?
Questions to Mr Monti
You yourself know full well which industries are affected.
That cannot be the meaning of enlargement.
But we have not yet reached that point.
Mrs Thors is raising a point of order.
What are the conditions under which services are provided?
What are the conditions under which people are working?
That is the corollary of free movement.
It forms part of the Community acquis.
My own personal opinion is irrelevant.
Basically their wishes concern transition periods.
I am not getting at you.
Please read the Rules of Procedure.
There are two questions.
I am not going to get into a debate.
Question No 43 by (H-0354/00):
This will considerably simplify state aid procedures.
You mentioned the problem of resources.
Question No 44 by (H-0355/00):
Thank you, Mr Turmes.
Question No 45 by (H-0383/00):
Commissioner, you have failed to answer my question.
Could you elaborate on that please?
I shall try, Mrs Ahern.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Carbon dioxide emissions from new cars
The report therefore returned for a second reading.
I am glad that this one has gone smoothly.
Parliament has asserted itself against the Council once again.
I think that is a huge success.
Mr President, unforgivably, I have forgotten something.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Interoperability of the trans-European rail systems
It is now 2.4 times higher than in 1990.
We really do need external inspection and certification agencies.
What is the subject matter?
Directive 96/48 was adopted for this purpose.
This is totally out of reach, economically.
There are two fundamental reasons for this situation.
The rapporteur has quite rightly adopted a gradual approach.
Technical solutions can vary a great deal.
They are not necessarily inferior, but different.
For Finland, this is an exceptionally major issue.
This is now a thing of the past.
Nobody can deny its importance.
This should not be done again.
A very good evening Mr President, Commissioner.
We have made no progress whatsoever with interoperability.
Allow me one more closing comment.
The comment about industry is correct.
What we need is technical interoperability.
That has already been said.
Safety is also, without doubt, an issue.
Airfreight manages perfectly well without border stops.
So let us adapt.
And all this in the year 2000!
Perhaps she is stuck at Brussels airport.
Perhaps she should have taken the train.
What is the problem?
Instead, we are now faced with the opposite.
I think that is important.
A difficult issue was that of personnel.
We have different gauges in Sweden and Finland.
Road traffic in Europe is increasing each year.
Rail transport must therefore become more attractive and competitive.
But still!
And yet the facts do not look very promising.
That is in nobody' s interest.
(Applause from various quarters)
Rail systems develop extremely slowly.
This route covers Germany, Geneva and Italy.
Firstly, a diversity of operators is required.
I find that totally atrocious.
The rail system has a tremendous future.
Most of the amendments to the report are acceptable.
Amendment 28, Article 22(3).
Amendment 29, Article 24(1).
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield
Surely it should have been the other way around.
He gave me a serious answer.
However, what about Euratom inspectors?
Can we trust them?
I can give them very short answers.
The THORP reprocessing plant produces continually more waste.
That is a quote from their report.
I have no time.
Let us not lose sight of the fundamentals here.
Regulatory safety mechanisms worked in this instance.
Both of these are forms of recycling.
The highest standards are required of any nuclear installation.
Their livelihoods were endangered.
There is undoubtedly progress.
My group cannot support the Green motion here tonight.
This is unacceptable.
A strategic approach is needed.
This is the view of the British regulatory authority.
I ask the Commissioner to reconsider her point.
I do not.
No, it did not!
She spoke of the damning indictment on safety checks.
No, it did not!
No, it did not.
The workers at BNFL raised the issue.
They were the ones who discovered it.
She spoke of the scandal of abuse of safety.
Then she finished by talking about corruption.
That really is the last throw of the dice.
Let us be clear.
Those lapses quite simply are not acceptable.
I wish them well.
But words are not enough.
They must be matched by deeds - their deeds.
Witness the BSE and dioxin problem.
I will conclude.
We need European rules.
That is also why we have restricted competence.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
Mr Robin Cook is in Moscow today.
Nothing.
I believe this is worth sharing with the House.
Thank you for your statement, Mrs Stenzel.
(The Minutes were approved)
Broad outlines of economic policies
.
This percentage is a familiar figure.
Firstly, there is competition.
This is a very important development.
We shall reject these amendments.
This is surely some mistake!
Finally, the basic problem still remains.
Now it is the euro.
Mr President, the report is self-contradictory.
This is absurd.
However, we must also reform our administrative systems.
I wish to concentrate on research and development.
Let us encourage women.
That is what makes them choose other careers.
We need a strategy.
Let us be innovative in the European Union.
It proposes increasing the flexibility of the labour market.
Beware!
Do we want even more?
The corruption of society eventually harms economic development.
That is a structural reform we must drive through.
It is not just in that area.
Unfortunately, spring had already started this year.
However, we reject the overall view.
Now that is what I call scandalous!
This is a crucial point.
The scepticism I have expressed here continues to grow.
We shall therefore be voting against this report.
This is something we have regularly stressed.
Since 1997, investment has been increasing progressively.
Stability and convergence programmes
Exactly the same applies to Greece.
We will have further debates on this.
The same applies to coordination of the taxation systems.
The opposite is true.
This perception betrays a rather narrow-minded budgetary policy.
It is something in addition to the Stability Pact.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Adoption of single currency by Greece
The rate of inflation exceeded 20%.
The public sector was notoriously mismanaged.
The stock exchange has undergone rapid expansion.
The situation is far from perfect, of course.
In 1985, the dollar stood at 3.5 DM.
Financial markets operate according to their own particular logic.
Greece has a tax reform problem.
We know it is.
The Swedish economy is doing well - very well.
Mr Goebbels also points this out.
The euro has provided greater stability.
This has benefited companies, especially small companies.
The euro is not weak.
The euro provides Europe with economic stability and competitiveness.
It is MU, not EMU.
We agree.
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer.
I welcome Greece into the euro zone.
Agenda
This means that Parliament must be consulted afresh.
Are there any objections?
That is why the Bureau proposed this solution.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, I quite understand your objection.
That is the usual arrangement.

Smet report (A5-0129/2000)
.
.
These restrictions are no longer acceptable today.
Please think about what this means exactly.
between 2007 and 2009 it will be 56 hours;
between 2009 and 2012 it will be 52 hours.
Roth-Berendt report (A5-0117/2000)
Savary report (A5-0113/2000)

Long-distance transport can only be regulated at European level.
Savary report (A5-0112/2000)
This fact is, in itself, expressive enough.
Adoption of single currency by Greece (continuation)
(Laughter, Applause)
That is undoubtedly a most impressive achievement.
The second important criterion is the public deficit.
We have some weighing up to do here.
Sweden, too, fulfils the basic economic requirements.
I look forward to that day.
There is talk of a referendum coming up.
I have a problem with that country.
The Greeks have produced a fantastic achievement.
A weak euro lets them down badly.
I think it is time for some changes.
I will be abstaining from the votes today.
The question of sustainability has reared its head again.
It has largely fulfilled requirements in this respect.
Whether this lasts remains to be seen.
Privatisation of state enterprise has made little headway.
It certainly is not privatisation in the real sense.
There is no comparison whatsoever.
The internal market is a reality now.
That is indisputable.
For me, the reason for this is clear.
There is a lack of leadership.
We will have a struggle on our hands.
Are they sustainable?
The second point of concern is inflation.
The Eurostat figures were also published this morning.
This is the end of a process.
When will the Commission enforce the Treaty?
The Commission always respects the Treaty.
It is obliged to comply with it.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
Transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings
Thousands of businesses will be affected.
Unfortunately, it did not continue down this path.
These are the considerations with regard to the proposal.
This caused me concern.
This sector is very clearly covered by specific conditions.
Can something be done about this?
An example is Internet connection.
These are very reasonable demands.
Otherwise we are heading towards a relatively chaotic situation.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is nothing new.
These credit institutions were completely excluded hitherto.
EUR 800 million is nothing at all!
Thirdly: separate accounting.
What about the social services?
What about the traditionally evolved social activities?
I am against the commercialisation of culture.
The Commission has thus overstepped the mark.
This requirement applies to both private and public companies.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Monti.
The debate is closed.
Poor countries' debt
It is facts that are important now.
We are all aware of the situation.
The whole thing verges on the ridiculous.
What action are we taking to prevent this?
The first EC tranche will be paid in July.
The immense repayment costs prevent any form of development.
Debt relief is therefore a matter of extreme urgency.
We should not be naÃ¯ve about this.
We can no longer write out blank cheques.
Aid was made conditional upon tangible results.
That is naturally not enough.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The country must fight corruption actively.
I do not believe that to be the case.
Let us learn from past experience.
It must be accompanied by proper management requirements.
I agree with a number of the contributions here.
That part of it is highly welcome.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Situation in Zimbabwe
This is a good sign.
The use of Article 366 should be considered.
People in Zimbabwe are afraid.
The people understand that and are aware of it.
Land reform is necessary, of course.
The facts speak for themselves.
We should not forget this.
We shall see what happens between now and then.
We know that none of this is being done.
We must also make our position very clear.
It is not just whites who are in danger.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It has a functioning civic institution and culture.
The opposition parties want more transparency.
On 24 June elections are going to be held.
They demand the elections.
They must be given a chance.
It is their future.
We must avoid this at all costs.
Threats can never create confidence and social harmony.
Lawlessness can never create security and human solidarity.
Enthusiastic young people from our two countries met.
Put away hatred.
But there is some way to go right now.
We are also in direct contact with the opposition.
This is the kind of system we have.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
We will examine questions to the Council.
The rest will be replied to in writing.
We will begin Question Time.
Question No 1 by (H-0350/00):
I hope that this is in fact the case.
Mr President, on a point of order.
That I do know about.
However, we shall continue with our agenda.
I will take good note of your question.
Question No 2 by (H-0361/00):
This has therefore created a new kind of dialogue.
The honourable Member has asked two questions.
They must result from a political decision.
Question No 3 by (H-0365/00):
This depends to a large extent on national parliaments.
Question No 5 by (H-0370/00):
I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his response.
I would like to offer Mr Crowley certain assurances.
Question No 8 by (H-0376/00):
That is all.
I repeat: they are unused CAP appropriations.
Question No 10 by (H-0381/00):
This matter should be considered at the Intergovernmental Conference.'
It is one of Parliament' s duties.
Question No 13 by (H-0389/00):
, Council.
It was most interesting.
What I am hearing is quite absurd.
Question No 14 by (H-0390/00):
I did ask a specific question about fisheries.
Question No 15 by (H-0391/00):
Question No 16 by (H-0396/00):
One of these groups is the disabled.
Question No 18 by (H-0392/00):
President-in-Office, thank you for the answer.
Will that remain the case?
Question No 20 by (H-0395/00):
However, Ecofin remains the decision-making body.
That is how the EU works.
Thank you very much, Mr Seixas da Costa.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
Telecommunications/radio spectrum policy
Experiences from India are equally bad.
This cannot be right.
.
Mr Paasilinna and Mr Alyssandrakis made reference to this.
Auctions can lead to high prices.
This may well be the case.
However, increasing market penetration brought the prices down.
There was no such consensus previously.
The Commission is undertaking many investigations and inquiries.
The market could have borne this quite satisfactorily.
Mr Alyssandrakis also highlights them in the report.
Appropriate instructions should be drafted to this end.
This means increased liquidity and market imbalances.
Parliament' s report will provide important input.
The Commission therefore welcomes the report from Mr Alyssandrakis.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Coherent European approach for space
.
Industry is undergoing a consolidation process.
My second point relates to future commercialisation.
GALILEO is a key word here.
Thank you, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel.
How can this be?
I am booking my seat today!
As the report stressed, these are essential.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Busquin.
The debate is closed.
European research area
Only 10% is spent on new innovative research.
It creates employment and prosperity.
I am very grateful for that.
There is indeed a European crisis in research funding.
We must increase it.
Legal devices are important.
We should improve the European patent.
They are the people at the sharp end.
We also need other things.
The omens are not entirely good.
It has never been taken up industrially.
That is also vital.
Your communication has brought the provisions to life.
The COST secretariat has already produced some commendable work.
Its position as research coordinator should be further strengthened.
This prioritisation should focus primarily on researchers and businesses.
This is what our approach must be.
So the area ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is why it is good to emphasise cooperation.
Cooperation, however, requires organisation.
This leads us onto the subject of youth.
What obstacles are there?
(The President cut the speaker off)
We cannot do this to the Commissioner either.
This had surprising results.
This is not the case.
They are from a different generation to mine.
This is why we support the Commissioner!
Dear Commissioner, what a challenge!
In these particular areas, European cooperation is meaningful.
Their results are plain to see.
In Europe there are no training programmes for researchers.
I repeat that we must recycle our teachers.
These two aspects are closely linked.
The first stage is clear.
With national research policies, the methodology exists.
That is no surprise to anyone, I think.
Thank you very much for your contribution, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Peking action platform
No statistical data exists.
This was also said a moment ago.
Another theme is decision making.
Women are very much absent in the media.
I would mention two areas, in particular.
We are now familiar with this.
This much we now know.
What is happening in Afghanistan is unjustifiable.
The figure for this Parliament is 30%.
Violence against women is another major issue.
Much still remains to be done, however.
But the heavens are not enough.
That is unacceptable.
Is that not so, Commissioner?
We quite agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Smet.
That was the reason for the delay.
The first is new changes in the information society.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.53 p.m.)
And a free and democratic Slovenia was born.
These are the laws of the global community.
Politics is lagging behind this trend.
In real life, several Europes exist.
Some of them will not get there without help.
We may call this the fourth Europe.
The possibility of bloody military clashes is still real.
Slovenia is a small nation.
The alternative is clear.
I must tell you, we particularly appreciated this.
You also mentioned unity in diversity.
We entrust the matter to your wisdom and authority.
Thank you, Mrs Napoletano.
Statements by the President
I have two statements to make.
You should therefore have received this statement by e-mail.
Once again, I thank her.
Go ahead, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.
However, we have all made a free choice.
France is a constitutional state.
I respect what Mr BarÃ³n Crespo says.
The sentence exists.
It is enforceable but not final.
I say this in order to refute these statements.
(Noise)
(Applause)
(Protests)
(Protests)
(The President cut the speaker off)
... the Conference of Group Chairmen.
(Protests and the President cut the speaker off)
I accept full responsibility in this matter.
You can imagine the problems this would cause!
This is my proposal.
What was right then cannot be wrong now.
(Applause)
Is this now clear to everyone?
(Mixed reactions) This is what happened.
A court delivers judgements.
He should brush up on his legal knowledge.
There was political confusion but no legal confusion.
The position of the Legal Affairs Committee was simple.
We absolutely must find the best solution.
We are now in a difficult position.
We must resolve this situation.
We do not have such a document.
We have reached an impasse.
The President is right.
This is my conception of Europe.
This can happen very quickly.
That is your right.
There is a discrepancy here.
That is your task, Madam President.
(Applause)
I agree with Mr HÃ¤nsch.
This is the best solution for everyone.
Equal treatment
Madam President, on a point of order.
I wish to make three brief points.
That is my first question.
I should like to have that confirmed.
Thank you, Mr Cox.
It is now 23.5 hours later.
Please, I beg you!
(Applause)
That is another issue.
We agree.
They would.
I would ask you to accept this request.
This really is a mess!
At what time will it start?
I have a right to know.
Trafficking in women
Various initiatives have already been taken at European level.
Last year, the Council adopted the DAPHNE programme.
A great deal therefore remains to be done.
.
Trafficking in women involves terrible sexual exploitation.
We must welcome and help them.
Some even go as far as committing suicide.
We should not forget that trafficking has economic roots.
Trafficking in women is a crime.
Mr President, it has already been said.
Men, girls and boys, are also involved.
Trafficking in women appears to be financially lucrative.
We will therefore continue to support this proposal.
This principle is important in a constitutional state.
This should not happen.
The problem is urgent and effective measures are required.
I myself totally support her report.
We must listen to them.
Yet it is actually a denial of freedom.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
The debate will take place as proposed.
The exact time will be announced later.
Vote
Indeed, Members throughout this House have supported it.
(Parliament rejected the joint motion for a resolution)
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Zimbabwe
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
I believe this is an unacceptable way to proceed.
I do not want to dig the rules up.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This is a tidying-up exercise.
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
Two committees made substantial input to it.
This seems a very enjoyable exercise.
I do not want to start another debate.
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
That will be the agenda.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Could you explain what the situation is?
All I can suggest is a belt-and-braces approach.
That was the point here!
That is correct.
So we will carry on with the debates.
This seems unacceptable to me.
We have agreed to vote at 6 p.m.
The house did that earlier.
That was a decision for the House.
The House is sovereign in these matters.
You are right.
I said an hour.
It was a slip of the tongue.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Could you provide us with information on that?
What procedures have been put in place?
Has the air-conditioning system now been switched off?
I have no information on this subject.
I will certainly draw attention to your remarks.
Public opinion within Europe requires us to be frugal.
Thirdly, because of the requirement of usefulness.
Multilingualism boosts the efficiency of parliamentary work.
We are in favour of this.
This cannot and will not happen.
Katiforis report (A5-0134/2000)
.
As a result we have voted against the report.
This is a positive step.
This last point clearly poses the main problem.
Yet the contradictions are striking.
Two points have particularly shaken us.
Can you believe it?
PomÃ©s Ruiz report (A5-0108/2000)
We have accordingly voted against the report.
Goebbels report (A5-0135/2000)
Sellafield resolutions
Randzio-Plath report (A5-0109/2000)
This is a distortion of competition.
Resolution on poor countries' debt
Resolution on Zimbabwe
The Mugabe regime is authoritarian and corrupt.
Paasilinna report (A5-0094/2000)
However, major problems remain.
I therefore abstained from voting on this report.
Alyssandrakis report (A5-0122/2000)
My mother lives in Rome.
I offered to teach her, but she refused.
Alyssandrakis report (A5-0119/2000)
Plooij-Van Gorsel report (A5-0131/2000)
Smet/GrÃ¶ner report (A5-0125/2000)
I have therefore voted in favour of it.
.
Quite the reverse.
We think quotas of themselves institutionalise discrimination.
This vision which we reject relies on empirical assumptions.
It is our duty to support them.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Equal treatment
Europe as a Community of values.
This arrangement works well and has caused few problems.
Unfortunately, statutory measures against racism are necessary.
Everyone is different, everyone is equal.
This is a Parliament with a proud record.
Racism is on the rise again.
We all have our local examples.
This has to stop.
It is a good text.
It is important legislation.
That is the first point.
A directive needs to be incorporated into national legislation.
This is what it is all about.
This will not be easy.
I do not agree with this.
This is taking it much too far.
We women are already familiar with this procedure.
Welcome
Equal treatment (continuation)
This proposed directive is a landmark for Europe.
However, certain shortcomings must be highlighted.
The first is of a general nature.
This is unacceptable.
Secondly, there is the issue of nationality.
Above all, we must firmly combat racist violence.
But it is important not to confuse separate issues.
The other vital area is religion.
Quite the opposite - it actually harms the cause.
Twenty years on, it is now coming true.
We are here discussing this directive.
This body is called the Committee on equal treatment.
This would be a gain, in my view.
And on time!
Initially, I was against racism being taken separately.
A number of Members have cited individual cases today.
May I turn specifically to some of the amendments.
This is working towards a shared burden of proof.
It is very pleasing to see this.
The European Parliament has also made its own contribution.
She has achieved a great deal.
Yet discriminatory practices are continuing.
Ensuring equal rights is a state responsibility.
The associations are currently leading the fight against discrimination.
Yes, I asked Mr Sylla to slow down.
They would throw them into the village pond.
Either way, the result is the same.
Red Guards would accuse intellectuals of bourgeois thinking.
(Heckling)
This legislation is unnecessary at a European level.
Mr President, I wish to make three points.
It has been a long time coming.
I suppose in a way it was worth waiting.
Yet a few clearly have darker motives.
Those who lie down with dogs get fleas.
I am afraid that this may be self-defeating.
I welcome the directive.
We have to demand the highest standards of ourselves.
That will not be easy or painless.
We are now talking about discrimination.
It will encourage abuse.
People will need to protect themselves against such abuse.
It will be necessary to keep more evidence.
Posturing is easy.
Motivations are many and varied.
We have some - we can improve ours.
The time is right to do so.
We are more than a trading block.
It is not perfect.
(Applause).
In fact, there was no such risk.
The EU has no competence in this area whatsoever.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately following the urgencies.
Topical and urgent debate
Sierra Leone
on the situation in Sierra Leone.
We are not prepared to make any sacrifices.
The United States is paralysed by the Somalia syndrome.
The Union hides behind Washington' s back.
He turned the disarmament pledge into a farce.
There are apparently about 360 of them.
That, if anything, is an understatement.
Ex-combatant children will again receive psychosocial support.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6 p.m.
Sri Lanka
on Sri Lanka.
The resolution sends out a powerful message.
The fighting has to stop.
This is a scourge which affects us all.
This situation must change.
The resolution is clear.
Something has to change.
The resolution states how many people he has killed.
The LTTE has to be stopped.
There it is.
I know Sri Lanka, I have been there.
That goes back longer than last May.
That is fairly clear and understandable.
I last visited Sri Lanka in the late 1980s.
We all hope that it ends very soon.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6 p.m.
Human rights
Philippines
on the Philippines.
Equatorial Guinea
on Equatorial Guinea.
Iran (press code)
on Iran.
Burma
on Burma.
on the right to safety at Euro 2000
Philippines
We should not put ourselves on a pedestal.
Equatorial Guinea
Secondly, the population endures harsh conditions of poverty.
Guinea is sinking further and further into under-development.
Iran (press code)
Why?
The reform process in Iran is at risk.
I therefore fully support everything Mrs RÃ¼hle has said.
Burma
These relations are too important for this.
Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned.
There is talk of forced labour.
This is the core of our request.
Football: "Euro 2000" and preventing hooliganism
Most Members will find this motion uncontentious.
This is wrong for several reasons.
This agreement engages the personal responsibility of the burgomaster.
Our fellow Member has spoken of regional pride.
Despite that, is there still a risk?
No authority and no official has indicated this.
So, be sporting!
Therefore, please withdraw your motion.
We strongly condemn such terrorist actions.
Obviously, we all hope for their early release.
I hope that their whereabouts will soon be discovered.
Moving on to Equatorial Guinea.
I turn to Burma.
I just wish to make two additional points.
I would just like to add one point.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6 p.m.
Mr President, on a point of order.
We have a Members bar in Brussels.
I hope we can have some clarification.
Thank you, Mr Sturdy.
Your point is well made.
That debate has been concluded.
So we have finished that whole section.
I do not want lots of debates.
We were going to discuss Guatemala.
Let us move forward now to the vote.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Vote
Everyone is entitled to this.
Europe must be inclusive, not exclusive.
We must tackle racism wherever and whenever it occurs.
These matters continue to be national concerns.
However, such initiatives are no longer enough.
We must go further and legislate.
We must lead the way in this fight.
That concludes the vote.
Trafficking in women (continuation)
Women and children are involved.
This report is very good.
Mr President, prevention is better than cure.
The body and the human person are not commodities.
Thirdly: the victims' rights.
But who are the clients?
This means promoting policies which support women.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m.
Readmission of third country nationals
The initiative does not show any strategic vision.
We only differed on a formal detail.
I would like to add a few important points.
This is bordering on blackmail.
Why not?
This idea is interesting for three reasons.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 7.50 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
This will obviously be corrected.
However, I have two questions to ask.
There is therefore no cause for alarm at present.
I asked for an air quality check in January.
Are there any other comments on the Minutes?
There are no further comments.
(The Minutes were approved)
Vote
That is all I wished to say.
I appealed to the House to act fairly.
Mr Duff, do you uphold your request?
We shall then see if 32 Members join you.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
The Commission proposes that the initiative be rejected.
That is primarily what we are voting on.
The text of the resolution itself should be rejected.
Indeed, it is quite complicated.
Before the start of the vote
(19 Members rose)
President.
The request is withdrawn.
Relating to Amendment No 10
The amendment seeks to correct this.
I wanted to point this out.
Relating to Amendment No 5
I endorse this amendment.
I apologise for the lack of clarity.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Non-NAFO vessels
NAFO has served as a model in many cases.
Overfishing certainly plays an important part in this regard.
EU law also has its origins in international law.
I would very much like to support this report.
This really has to stop.
There is no way of enforcing the law.
This is why it is so popular.
The EU is among the worst in this sense.
Each country tends to have their preferred flag use.
For Greece it is Cyprus and Panama.
The preferred British countries are Panama and Belize.
The Council refused.
Amendment No 1 does not seem to be necessary.
Amendment No 3 is not acceptable to the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) EXPLANATION OF VOTE
Protection of juveniles of marine organisms
They represent the latest technical and scientific developments.
Quantity instead of quality?
These measures are a step in the right direction.
How many would be decommissioned?
How many were scrapped?
How many were sunk and so on?
How many were simply transferred to another flag?
It is important for the conservation of sea birds.
Mr President, this is an important subject.
We can improve our resources.
This is highly technical.
The same applies to trains or trucks.
There is no need for it.
It is called "Seascapes".
I hope that was not true.
That concludes the debate.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) EXPLANATION OF VOTE
We will ensure that is enforced.
Insurance
We have discussed this subject in great depth.
Therefore, the rules on this are strict.
The present report is available.
Whether this is correct or not is doubtful.
Thank you very much.
Affairs and the Internal Market.
Everyone needs insurance these days.
This is better than doing nothing at all.
Most of these notifications concerned insurance pools.
That concludes the debate.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATION OF VOTE
What is going on here then?
This cannot be right, Mr President!
I will, of course, check ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
There you have it.
Insurance companies consider that the elderly are worthless.
But I say that the elderly are worth more.
I will take that as an interesting intervention.
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting closed at 11.30 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Tribute
Mrs Adelaide Aglietta was a very courageous woman.
Statement by the President
Once again political confrontation shows its most dreadful aspect.
Nelson Mandela deserves a different kind of respect.
We heard Mandela in the European Parliament.
Thank you, Mr Blak.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I will ensure that Mrs Banotti gets that information.
I should like to thank you for that.
I have two criticisms of the framework agreement.
I have just one more sentence....
(The President cut the speaker off)
You have made a mistake in this case.
Thank you.
I shall take note of your comments.
This is not acceptable.
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
That is all I wished to say.
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.
Are there any other comments on the Minutes?
There are no further comments.
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
Who wishes to speak to propose this?
We have always stressed prevention.
We are not here to start a debate.
Let me make that point.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
(Parliament approved the proposal)
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
In short, no such inquiry is possible.
I think the House must decide.
This was repeated on other occasions.
Our recommendation is that we should not waive immunity.
It is a matter of a demonstration.
I therefore think that the matter is quite clear.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products
Tobacco is a natural stimulant.
This is our business.
And rightly so!
The best means of communication is the packet itself.
First and foremost, the information is misleading.
This terminology should be withdrawn.
How much space, you may ask?
Well, enough space.
This is bound to result in better policy.
The Commission has made no reference to this effect.
'Smoking can kill' .
Mr President, smoking is bad for the health.
Secondly, I would like to touch upon health.
Longer texts render the warnings less forceful.
The product concerned is also more expensive.
Hence the distinction drawn.
And that is what counts.
This is not, however, the case.
Several contentious issues still remain.
Tar content must be limited still further.
And it will upset them retroactively.
Multinationals are already doing just that.
Calendar of part-sessions for 2001
The President has just requested this of me.
All MEPs will already have received this in writing.
The following dates are proposed:
15.1.
19.1.2001
31.1.
1.2.2001
12.2.
16.2.2001
28.2.

16.11.2001
28.11.
29.11.2001
10.12.
14.12.2001
Of course, many more people die too.
These are intelligent and reasonable suggestions.
What is this sideways shift?
We are putting labels on everything.
It is the trump card that beats any freedoms.
That is how irrational things can be.
What does that prove?
This is the sideslip into self-righteousness and hypocrisy.
We are told that there are social costs.
Then there is the puritanical sideslip.
I hear: moral order, the Salem witches.
This affects one million jobs in Europe.
Tobacco is no ordinary product of course.
We also know about its addictive effect.
The product is far too dangerous.
What can we do as regulators?
We should be able to admit to this.
Tobacco generates big bucks.
I believe it has to precede it.
Last century, smoking was part of the culture.
It was important and provided a sense of security.
My second comment concerns labelling.
Every year, tobacco kills more people.
We should seek to turn the tables on them.
And the bigger the better.
We need warnings which are much bigger.
I would like to add one other point.
Most of it is imported.
Let us use it intelligently.
The export issue is probably the most difficult.
That would be devastating.
I now regard myself as a nicotine addict.
But I am not bothering anyone else.
Mr President, smoking kills!
But our children must not start smoking.
That is what this directive should aim to achieve.
Supporting non-production, that is the goal.
Nor is it for this House to decide.
Let the courts decide.
It is important that we fight delaying tactics today.
The EU already regulates health warnings and tar yields.
The health warning should be large and explicit.
We must warn of the dangers of passive smoking.
I started smoking when I was 11 years old.
I ended up smoking 40 a day.
My health has been damaged by smoking.
There was no warning when I took up smoking.
Now I am the victim of passive smoking.
I have asthma attack after asthma attack.
Smoking is unhealthy.
The question is whether we want this.
Whatever the dimensions, the information will remain ineffective.
In my opinion, this is a ridiculous discussion.
I believe that nobody can rationally oppose this.
Why not simply talk about the processing of tobacco?
Why not talk about this processing?
We should put our money where our mouth is.
That is not what is happening here.
Why are you doing nothing in this respect?
Cigarettes have a share of approximately 91%.
These products are manufactured by small and medium-sized enterprises.
This has been scientifically proven beyond doubt.
Temptation is best tackled with a lack of money.
We have a duty to take action.
Reducing consumption will cause a decrease in production.
I totally agree with Mr Martinez who spoke earlier.
I support anyone who protects health.
We must be more courageous!
We must make a clear assessment of the consequences.
We cannot afford to lose jobs and tax revenue.
The subsidies for this are part of structural aid.
Jobs will be lost and cultural landscapes will decline.
Yet this will not mean a decrease in smoking.
We must strive for international regulations here.
The consumers are not innocents abroad.
They are aware of the risks of smoking.
It would save money on health services.
That is my plea.
Can we not get the marketing message to them?
We would have to protect the tobacco farmers.
We must find alternatives.
We must correct that anomaly.
Madness!
What is the difference?
The state should fund it.
The fact is that tobacco kills.
I know it is a difficult issue.
Now we want to repeal them.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Accidental or deliberate marine pollution
It is a catastrophe.
The Erika is a good example of that.
What is the situation today?
We must also stress the importance of research.
It is destruction which spreads far and wide.
Either way, the marine environment is polluted.
It is high time.
When will the matter finally be referred to Parliament?
We shall, of course, support these.
We therefore agree with the philosophy behind this report.
In practice, only the carrier is accused.
Thankfully the danger passed.
I welcome Ms McKenna's report.
The remaining amendments are problematic for the following reasons.
The Commission cannot therefore approve these amendments.
So what kind of protection is there?
Other amendments cannot be approved.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Substances that deplete the ozone layer
There are nonetheless still three outstanding problems.
It has therefore been held up as exemplary.
This is extremely worrying.
I shall reply in English.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Digital television in the European Union
This is still the case, of course.
What do I mean by that?
We need to avoid this at all costs.
This is a step in the right direction.
It has to come from the industry.
My second remark concerns open access.
It is also a cultural Europe.
In the background are issues of copyright.
I am delighted with the report by Mrs Thors.
We adopted a very well balanced report in committee.
We intend to vote against both proposed amendments.
Infrastructure and content industry are coming together.
This means that two aspects should be monitored effectively.
This is an unwanted development.
This means digital television but also television without frontiers.
It is a very sound and important report.
There is no internal market for TV services.
"But what is this Thors report?"
There are no more barriers.
Competition alone does not guarantee it.
They make some things possible more than others.
It is a focused report.
They will have different forms of competition.
The Commission welcomes this report.
However, the market is developing open standards.
I fully support this.
Even digital free-to-air services are being encrypted.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Electronic communications and associated services
This is completely new.
The markets are moving extremely fast.
The developments transcend national borders.
I have thanked the Commissioner.
That is democracy.
This is why this report is so important.
That is not being technology-neutral.
Hence political objectives must be fulfilled.
Liberalisation should benefit subscribers and competition.
Therefore this is a clear example of market imperfection.
It is continuing to work on an independent basis.
I just felt that this needed to be said.
Market or society.
We are indeed dealing with a market.
That much is certain.
Everything is moving in that direction.
May we hope for some consistency on this?
This brings me to the matter of content.
EU-technology in mobile-phone systems is well advanced.
Fair competition is vital to suppliers.
Pre-conditions are important to consumers too.
That is bound to lead to distortions in competition.
We had a few discussions about this in committee.
But that is something I personally feel strongly about.
But companies are even less motivated in this respect.
It is all very vague.
Therefore I intend to vote against this report.
I would like to touch on four of them.
That is wrong.
I do not believe so.
Beauty contests often favour incumbents with established track records.
We need transparency in this sector to this end.
The emergency number 112 has very special significance.
My final point concerns the proceeds from auctions.
It increases the transparency of political activity.
We must continue the privatisation programme.
A great deal has been said.
Communication also means information.
Many important things have been said.
.
This sends the right signals to markets.
The same question was put by Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m.
I find it a very important issue.
Mr Glante asked the question of who decides what.
EU strategy on financial information
The political aspect will encompass all Member States.
I hesitate to answer this question in the affirmative.
Everyone should then adhere to them.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Vote
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
Procedure without debate (Rule 114):

Could this be clarified please?
I am afraid we cannot have a split vote.
It is out of time.
(Parliament adopted the resolution) President.
That concludes the vote.

Indeed, the IOPCF apparatus looks particularly perverse.
This is a small step in the right direction.
Report Thors (A5-0143/2000)

However, continued good public service broadcasting is essential.
This will promote interoperability without undermining innovation.

.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Question Time (Commission)
We will examine questions to the Commission.
First Part
Question No 29 by (H-0452/00):
Have you, the Commission, done anything?
Question No 30 by (H-0437/00):
Let us get to the point.
This decision has been entirely their own.
Question No 31 by (H-0482/00):
I am also very grateful for your reply myself.
Does it intend to implement any urgent measure?
We will follow this very closely.
Question No 32 by (H-0444/00):
I want to thank the Commissioner for her answer.
Restructuring must not be prevented.
Question No 33 by (H-0473/00):
Second part
Questions to Mr Busquin
I wish to thank the Commissioner for her response.
Maybe we could be innovative.
I agree.
Question No 34 by (H-0507/00):
This was a welcome step.
Questions to Mr Liikanen
.
Question No 35 by (H-0445/00):
These observations also covered the question of spirits.
That is very important.
I ask him to direct his attention to that.
Question No 36 by (H-0448/00):
However, gas vehicles emit high levels of methane.
There are also a number of quite well-developed networks.
- Thank you for the question.
Question No 37 by (H-0467/00):
I would thank the Commissioner for his answer.
The issue of auctions will be carefully monitored.
Question No 38 by (H-0477/00):
I thank the Commissioner for his reply.
Questions to Mrs Reding
Question No 42 by (H-0438/00):
There is a lack of agreement.
Commissioner, you give a very full response.
I can read documents.
Let me give you a concrete example.
Question No 44 by (H-0504/00):
Question No 45 by (H-0505/00):
As you can see, it all hangs together.
In fact, it was my baby.
Mrs Anastassopoulos is in charge of these files.
Question No 46 by (H-0506/00):
Commissioner, your answer was most helpful.
So there is a problem here.
Consequently, the question remains.
Would it be possible to reduce prices?
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Historical liabilities from JRC nuclear activities
The Committee on Budgets has rejected this working method.
A sustainable model for a solution already exists.
This is not current research.
The trialogue is urgently needed.
Certainly not!
Those people are getting older and will retire.
I support the proposal for a trialogue.
It seems the sensible approach.
That is not the way to go about things.
But first we must have clarity.
It warrants praise rather than brickbats.
This legacy, however, cannot be refused.
Implementation of this action programme has already started.
This is not a problem.
Mrs Plooij van-Gorsel spoke of this.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Restrictions for products subject to excise duties (Sweden)
Beer is produced in Sweden.
It even has beneficial effects on health.
Why not?
Apparently Commissioner Bolkestein was opposed to extending this derogation.
Why have you changed your mind?
That is not the case today.
Mr Maaten has prepared a good report.
Border trade between Sweden and its neighbours is flourishing.
Now is the time to find new solutions.
I do not share that view.
Let us take care, then!
It is the same problem.
Swedish alcohol policy is now in pieces.
Should that be a so-called right?
Is that a level consistent with moderate consumption?
The debate is closed.
Exchange of information with third countries
A final comment.
We often have that dilemma within Member States.
.
It is necessary to improve supervision of financial conglomerates.
That indeed is what happens in the United Kingdom.
Opinions differ very much indeed.
We are dealing here with a very sensitive question.
It was welcomed by ECOFIN.
Nor does it deal with stock exchanges.
But thinking does not stop.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Imports of beer into Finland
Finland obtained an extension of this derogation until 2003.
Make of it what you will!
These include regulations on the importation of beer.
Beyond our frontiers are countries where prices are low.
Our problem is the enormous difference in taxation.
The cost of alcohol fell.
That makes for a pretty powerful brew.
Because we do have experience of it.
There is research data on that.
Then you say that education helps.
What happened?
In other words, total consumption is increasing.
And we still have an additional problem.
Our resources are insufficient for that.
That is the issue here.
I have referred in part to points of order.
This concludes my comments.
.
He even suggested that I had reduced excise duties.
Mr FÃ¤rm also criticised me for defending wine producers.
I am proud that I did though!
It would be much better for their health.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Statistics for trade between Member States
Why are we supporting this so strongly?
There are two problem areas.
I would like to congratulate them on their work.
However, you have raised a couple of issues.
The Commission is not concern about the delay.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
This latest event leaves Russia teetering on the brink.
The consequences of this will be devastating.
Thank you.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
I have not quite understood the honourable member.
We shall clarify the matter.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
I now have another statement to make.
Yesterday Mr Lannoye moved to ...
(Interruption by Mr Brok)
You have therefore not answered my question.
We can do that separately and at different times.
Mr Lannoye, that goes without saying!
Decision on urgent procedure
The matter was referred back to committee.
.
Thank you.
Mrs Schierhuber has asked to speak.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
He has outlined the matter quite clearly.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure.)
President.
Mr President, allow me a brief personal comment.
I therefore refute what Mr SeppÃ¤nen has said.
President.
Mr Korakas on a point of order.
European political parties
However, we are taking a constructive view.
The current situation is becoming increasingly complicated.
We managed to have the political parties recognised.
But what is European awareness?
European parties, let us not kid ourselves!
.
This must be stated and restated.
This is not just a question of money.
At present people and national parties are elected.
The proposal was touched on at the intergovernmental conference.
We shall comply with these demands.
The second step is the amendment of the Treaties.
This seems a rhetorical question to me.
The situation is in fact quite paradoxical.
First, there are European parties.
I have nothing against European parties.
The criticism of the Court of Auditors was justified.
Many problems can only be solved jointly.
Global problems must be solved in the UN.
Mr President, this is a question of democracy.
I suspect these abuses are now being covered up.
The European political parties do not represent democracy.
Europe is not a nation; it is nations.
We have no concept of supranational democracy.
Parties of parties are not democracy.
That is my first point.
.
We need this collaboration between the three institutions.
They consult each other.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Security and defence
All that remains is Article 5.
It is still our aim.
This will occur during the next presidency.
I welcome the report by Mrs LalumiÃ¨re.
It is an exceptionally helpful document.
We need to step up our efforts of coordination.
We should build on existing competencies.
Let me be clear about the Commission's role.
We had the Pleven plan.
We had de Gasperi.
We had Fouchet.
This time we have to make a difference.
Europe awoke when the crisis in Kosovo arose.
Let us not harbour any illusions.
It will take time - time and money.
The former is obviously the approach we favour.
What do you intend to do, Commissioner?
What is the state of play?
Their plans are clear.
Let me start by making a positive comment.
I would like to specify two.
One is the EU' s say.
I would like to make one final point.
This does not necessarily include more resources.
Military is what the USA does best.
Secondly: we reject a European military block formation.
I think it is a fairly typical figure.
Such an approach would lead to failure.
We need plain agreements on competencies in this field.
Mr President, last month we celebrated Europe Day.
We share the same planet and the same fate.
One more point: the importance of Parliament.
It is about intervention.
Obviously not.
We do not want this.
Thank you, Catherine LalumiÃ¨re.
Please face reality.
We must try to shape it positively.
A small-scale NATO is emerging.
The European Union must be able to act autonomously.
What does autonomous mean in relation to NATO?
The second point is about democratic control.
This mainly relates to the government.
The government conference can benefit from this.
We need to address that.
They must be subject to parliamentary control.
It is a remarkable achievement.
We need a strong, competitive European defence industry.
We still rely heavily on intergovernmental activity.
The Commission has a crucial role in this.
This Commission has been completely silent on this issue.
Kosovo has been mentioned several times today.
In fact, four issues are at stake.
Thirdly, the facility for rapid, targeted intervention.
But we should try for institutional revolution.
This is somewhat disingenuous.
But this apparently is not enough.
There is a psychological explanation for this.
We cannot build up an expensive parallel structure.
There is no problem with the figures.
It is qualitative.
The problem lies in the content.
An enormous amount of valuable property has been destroyed.
The commitment of the Member States is essential.
The current challenges cannot be deferred or hesitated over.
I congratulate Mrs LalumiÃ¨re on her work.
We too share these concerns.
This Committee was specifically created during the Portuguese Presidency.
Mr President, it has been an interesting debate.
I shall be mercifully brief.
We have made proposals for cleaning up the Danube.
I hope we can get quick decisions.
President.
The debate is closed.
Welcome
Vote
Is this allowed under our Rules?
I am sure everyone can see the funny side.
Are there any other points of order?
It mentions the "President of Canada".
There is no president of Canada.
Calendar of part-sessions of Parliament for the year 2001
Dell' Alba (TDI).
These amendments have been deemed to be inadmissible.
(Parliament adopted the calendar of part-sessions as amended)
Simplified procedure - without report
(Parliament approved the initiative)
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
(The President approved the common position)
(Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
(Applause)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions in successive votes)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That cannot be the purpose of the compromise.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I would like to add something further.
.
.
.
It undermines Parliament's credibility and political impact.
.

Schengen Agreement
Beysen recommendation (A5-0153/2000)
But to what end?
Maaten Report (A5-0156/2000)
Only once, Mr President.
'And when was that?' you may ask.
All cigarettes are harmful.
None do any good.
No man is an island.
All human beings are involved with each other.
Other regions must decide on their own regulations.
They show that Parliament puts public health first.
Protecting public health is effectively our responsibility.
I am therefore against smoking.
.
.
Unfortunately my proposal was not adopted.
Snuff is addictive.
.
.
These figures speak for themselves and are terrifying.
Tobacco is not just like any other product.
.
.
I am disappointed it was not accepted.
They have misled people for far too long.
This is simply not true.
But the jobs will be lost here.
Unilateral action by the EU will be pointless.
Berenguer Fuster report (A5-0142/2000)
Lulling report (A5-0144/2000)
Vidal-Quadras Roca report (A5-0159/2000)
And who was that?
Maybe you can enlighten me, Mr President.
.
Special UN conference: Women 2000
That was an exceptionally useful piece of political coordination.
Collectively we fought hard to move forward from Beijing.
The document reaffirms women's rights as human rights.
It is in our interest to fight for this.
But back to Europe.
I would ask you to give attention to this.
They need to be involved in this process.
I should also like to thank Mrs Smet.
This threat also involved insults being made.
The final document embodies progress in certain respects.
This is not in our legislation.
Please answer me, Mr Patten.
Our work has been outstanding in this respect.
Mr Varaut, you are very badly informed.
You have made a fool of yourself.
Your information is not accurate.
It is not even true.
Your intervention is very unfortunate because it is false.
Poverty affects women more than anybody else.
This is greatly disappointing.
The fight goes on.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I have always supported women's rights.
It must be an error.
I am sorry about that.
The difficulties were immense.
I am extremely grateful to everyone for this.
We must take advantage of all these opportunities.
Thank you, President of the Council.
We all share this hope.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
If Poland tells us that it is free...
You were speaking about a point of order.
You are quite right, Mr President.
Tunisia - Human rights - EU-Tunisia Agreement
Why should we discuss Tunisia?
Militants are imprisoned and tortured.
And this is the moment to do so.
Why is Europe silent about human rights in Tunisia?
He seems to be obsessed by them.
Would Commissioner Patten agree with me there?
Furthermore, his passport is still being withheld.
It guarantees nothing.
It only provides guarantees for the despot in power.
So what can we do?
It is unacceptable.
They therefore asked for understanding and patience.
We do not work in this way.
He underlined the constant need to respect fundamental freedoms.
I would like to explore this further with Tunisia.
It is the projection of stability.
What are we trying to do there?
Tunisia is not being treated differently in any way.
However, my question is practically the same.
Why are we arguing about the situation in Tunisia?
How dynamic will it be?
How determined will it be?
What involvement can it guarantee?
I have two very specific questions.
The repression is not only aimed at political opponents.
I would like to make two comments.
What practical and specific steps can we take?
Tunisia' s rulers have two solutions today.
Mr President, human rights are being infringed.
This is something we know about.
This is an extremely serious matter.
Which is why we cannot do without it.
The Balkans are not our only priority.
But we must do that all together and sensitively.
Thank you, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
China's accession to WTO
Those have been my comments.
My two questions are as follows:
The question is clear.
As I have said, Parliament supports this agreement.
It is good news all round.
This is a good news story.
First, the question about Parliament's assent.
However, at this stage these are just proposals.
So the results are clear.
Will it result in institutional reforms in China?
Secondly, a point addressed to the Council.
This simply cannot carry on.
Thirdly, technical assistance.
Finally, human rights.
We should be all the more robust.
It would be extremely interesting to know.
Another matter is that of human rights.
In what way is Wei Jingsheng mistaken?
Now, what has happened since that abortive summit?
That is what is on the agenda.
So I beg to differ with Commissioner Patten.
Powerful international agri-business knows that too.
That was a very bad mistake.
The debate is closed.
Clearly there is pressure on our agenda today.
Everybody supports this matter.
Possibly we could have a vote on it now.
But we take very good note of this proposal.
Question Time (Council)
We will examine questions to the Council.
Question No 1 by (H-0434/00):
These three institutions undertook to respect these limits.
(The President cut the speaker off)
In practice this meant reducing the amounts established.
This is my personal view.
Question No 3 by (H-0446/00):
The Council would analyse this proposal with due care.
My question pertains particularly to radioactive emissions.
Is the Council aware of this study?
Would it like more information about this study?
The Council needs to get its act together.
Question No 4 by (H-0449/00):
I received its reply today.
The President-in-Office' s reply is correct.
Question No 5 by (H-0450/00):
The Council will then re-examine the situation.
This is an important point.
Obviously it sees it as an unnecessary luxury.
But that is a matter for the Greek government.
My question is quite specific.
Question No 6 by (H-0451/00):
Question No 7 by (H-0454/00):
We are continuing to closely monitor this situation.
I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
There are other specific institutions to do this work.
Question No 8 by (H-0457/00):
However, this can only be ratified in Ecofin.
How can we avoid this?
We must be clear on this, Mr Krarup.
It is as simple as that.
There should be no doubt on this.
Question No 9 by (H-0458/00):
Everything is open here in Parliament.
But the Council of Ministers meets in secret.
Nevertheless these matters are done in secret.
I do not agree, Mr Newton Dunn.
Question No 10 by (H-0460/00):
Mr President, I will be very brief.
Question No 11 by (H-0462/00):
This is an important point.
Question No 12 by (H-0466/00):
Mr Gahrton, the Petersberg tasks have several dimensions.
Some are purely humanitarian, for example rescue tasks.
Is that the case?
They are saying exactly what their commitment is.
Question No 13 by (H-0471/00):
This is therefore a matter of political good faith.
This is what is happening today.
Question No 14 by (H-0474/00):
This is not a matter for the Council.
Thank you for agreeing to take the question.
No EU body has adopted any measure against Austria.
These are the famous 'sanctions' .
I wanted to ask the President-in-Office to clarify something.
This should be a Europe of unity and solidarity.
Why?
Only time?
That is the essence of the matter.
Why systematically place the onus on the 14 countries?
Why must the 14 Member States change?
What has happened in Austria to justify this change?
Thank you very much, Mr Seixas da Costa.
May you achieve much for Europe!
That concludes Questions to the Council.
Change to the agenda
Is there any objection to the proposal?
(Parliament gave its assent)
Reconstruction of Central America
.
I would like to highlight four issues.
In this respect, two facts worry us.
The European Parliament therefore requests a significant increase.
This process was a success.
We therefore welcome the Commission' s proposal.
We stand by the sum proposed for Central America.
We all know that full well.
I remember the date: November 18-19 1998.
On the contrary.
This resolution has the advantage of going beyond emergencies.
Perhaps Commission staff could be reassigned.
I would like to quote the example of sugar.
We just cannot say for certain.
I only wish there were not.
It is now June 2000.
I consider that to be far too long.
.
Another important element will be the Stockholm Follow-up Group.
These problems have now been overcome.
No further delays are expected at this point.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
Asylum procedures
These officials must have access to cross-border information.
This includes welfare, accommodation etc.
I know that some people are critical of this.
He speaks from the heart.
Assert yourself in your party.
I am not judging that.
That is something else entirely.
That is a huge step forward for us.
Mr President, fellow members.
What shape is the European asylum policy in?
Then there was the Tampere Summit.
Things were looking up, according to many journalists.
What needs to happen now?
All sorts of things need to happen.
Tempus fugit!
There are difficulties at hand though.
But this should not divert us from our purpose.
No.
We should not regard refugees as interested parties.
Moreover, the flow of refugees is limited.
It is problem of method.
That also forms part of the legal framework.
A cost-sharing policy must also be established.
Solidarity must be for all.
Exiles should be granted asylum.
Who is going to help me?
And I replied, "Do not worry.
The sense of consensus is to be welcomed.
The resolution calls for temporary protection within three years.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Crime victims in the EU
Why is this so necessary?
We cannot let victims wait for that long.
In particular, additional measures are required for minors.
This applies to all the European institutions.
We have embarked upon a new process.
This is excellent.
We hope for concrete action in the future.
The necessary conditions are broadly present.
Active means of support must also be developed.
I congratulate the rapporteur on her work.
I also urge it be ambitious.
This is especially true in the case of terrorism.
What are we currently doing?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Late payment in commercial transactions
However, I am at a disadvantage.
It is a bitter pill to swallow.
It is regulating what should be regulated.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Again, nothing more, nothing less.
I have another question for the Commission.
It is a sensational result.
Congratulations!
I believe that this is a magnificent definition.
Consequently, public expenditure will also be reduced.
I think that this aspect cannot be stressed enough.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Thank you, Mrs Buitenweg.
Everyone has their own personal and political responsibility.
I was speaking personally.
I do not think I abused my position.
It really is absolutely unacceptable.
We will try to put an end to it.
We make virtually no use of it at all.
Mrs Pack is quite right.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
European Council of 19/20 June 2000
The next item is the joint debate on the:
Instead this will be an exchange of information.
This report is ready now.
We have closed 10 and opened 6.
This is very important.
We await the responses with confidence.
I am speaking on his behalf.
That is a crucial point for us as well.
It is the condition for making it a success.
That is a second point.
First I want to talk about the enlargement.
Progress has already been made.
Finally, the fiscal package.
Thank you, Mr Barnier.
I refer to the 'proactive snapshot' .
That is the first challenge.
Commissioner Barnier has talked about majority voting.
We need both majority voting and enhanced cooperation!
Commissioner Barnier talked about a basic treaty.
I would like to add one more thought.
I therefore urge you to make this your business.
But we nevertheless hope you will succeed.
It is completely contradictory to have citizenship without rights.
We deeply appreciate that.
We in my group very much believe that.
I cite qualified majority voting as an example.
That is intolerable.
In our opinion, this is very welcome.
The second issue is the Intergovernmental Conference.
The third issue is the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Its content is not in question.
The fourth and final issue is enlargement.
Then Europe could be some use for once.
Otherwise, cooperation must take place elsewhere.
My group rejects majority decision-making on enhanced cooperation.
He must rectify what could have been avoided.
A report or document is not enough.
This only needs officials to attend the meetings.
We have drafted 60 clauses and provoked 1000 amendments.
This is now proving an improbable task.
Even so, there is every reason for concern.
We have no confidence in the Union project.
These have been lively months internationally.
I will now focus purely on the Middle East.
We will debate those issues whatever happens.
But these are two parallel exercises.
Enhanced cooperation cannot constitute an alternative.
First we must work on the content.
That is our main task.
Thank you again, Portuguese Presidency.
The EU has not been paralysed.
All these points are extremely important.
I must also say something on the Austria issue.
This has been a constant concern.
This must be borne in mind.
The following concept must be taken into account.
Thank you, Minister.
The Commission will shoulder its responsibilities.
It will take the initiative.
That is what we are doing after Lisbon.
I am not just saying complete them.
I am talking about success.
Success in Nice.
Concluding successfully is more than simply concluding.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
It is a very poignant birthday for her.
In March, her husband died of cancer.
Mrs Kinnock, I thank you for your words.
(Applause)
We discussed and concluded this matter yesterday.
Good, we have taken note of this.
Vote
This is a serious political and translation error.
I have consulted the services involved.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
With regard to paragraph 38:
My knowledge of the other languages is insufficient.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
Thank you, Mrs McCarthy.
I have taken due note of this.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Murphy Report (A5-0154/2000)
The negotiations on this text were difficult.
I have therefore voted in favour of this text.
That was before the last European elections.
But despite that, the directive goes on.
Maaten Report (A5-0160/2000)
I voted against this measure.
More duty.
This will be good for the balance sheet" .
I do not think so!
I therefore voted against the motion.
It is time the Government realised this.
Their content has not even been considered.
Parliament has spoken very clearly.
Thank you for your reaction.
On that account I did not vote for it.
That is why I felt I had to abstain.
The very future of Europe is at stake.
Hence my militant abstention on this text!
Shame on the sorcerer' s apprentices!
This is unacceptable to us.
Since then little has changed.
.
However, this is not what the text does.
After all, what has changed in Austria?
Has the government fallen?
1.
2.
3.
4.
Security and defence policy (B5-0505/2000)
That leaves Article 5.
I cannot, therefore, support the resolution.
"Women 2000" (RC B5-0562/2000)
I will therefore abstain from voting on this resolution.
I thank the Members for their important communication.
Naturally, those responsible will be brought to account.
Structural Funds (1998)
The forthcoming enlargement will add to this problem.
Structural policy simultaneously reacts to and creates regional structures.
The previous speaker mentioned this problem.
Let me give you another example.
I would like to concentrate on two issues.
The offer of funding was consequently withdrawn.
It also encourages pioneering activities.
Moreover, the distribution of unemployment is extremely uneven.
The importance of the latter cannot be emphasised enough.
The Structural Funds cannot operate in isolation.
We also refer to that principle in the report.
There must also be built-in assessment mechanisms.
This is particularly true in the case of Italy.
The checking and assessment mechanisms have been decidedly inadequate.
The result is certainly not outstanding.
Firstly, finalising a harmonised methodology.
Naturally, it is a complex business.
You asked me about your draft Article 5.
Fourthly, complementarity with other Community policies.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Barnier.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Topical and Urgent Debate
Basic freedoms in Serbia and Kosovo
Thank you.
You can imagine how they rate quality there!
The situation in these prisons is indescribable.
The people have received no legal representation.
That is the picture in Serbia.
We must try to ensure greater police protection.
That much should be clear to us.
That is what we have to concentrate on.
I was there before the war began.
The EU countries must send more police and judges.
The Serbs must be helped to return home.
The independent media are thwarted.
A very negative trend is setting in.
Politicians are under threat.
There is a murderous atmosphere.
The assaults are relentless.
CCL recently branded them terrorists.
The opposition in Serbia needs us.
We have some opportunities here.
The situation in Kosovo today is different.
They find themselves in a difficult situation.
Help them.
They are despondent and fearful.
That is the situation we are dealing with.
We have been doing that for years.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Coup d'Ã©tat in Paraguay
Paraguay is one of the worst examples of this.
There is nothing separating us on that.
The Paraguayan people never gave in.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Peru
Mr President, the situation in Peru worries us.
(Applause)
Vote (continuation)
That is exactly what was on my list.
We now come to the final vote.
They have already been voted upon.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, on a point of order.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Tunisia (B5-0508/2000)
.
Marset Campos Report (A5-0133/2000)
Bordes (GUE/NGL).
Schmitt Report (A5-0123)
Berthu (UEN).
Why launch a discussion?
We risk being caught up in the system.
.
They therefore become the border guards of fortress Europe.
.
.
Respect for human rights should be maintained internationally.
Germany has virtually ceased to grant asylum.
In Germany, they are categorically forbidden to work.
They have become the first "transparent people" .
Asylum-seekers are accordingly denigrated as being a burden.
.
It was our pride and our duty.
There are omissions and certain points are still unclear.
This is why requests from Chechnya are not examined.
The report remains vague on this subject.
I abstained on Amendment No 14.
Report SÃ¶rensen (A5-0126/2000)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
.
- (FR) Congratulations!
What is the solution?
So wake up and take responsibility!
Report Turco (A5-0138/2000)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
.
But freedom of speech must be upheld!
I am genuinely perplexed.
I personally cannot give you any explanation at present.
Cohesion Fund (1998)
However, certain issues must be raised.
I share this concern.
This was not by chance, Mrs SchÃ¶rling.
I am particularly interested in this issue.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
Integrated control system for Community aid schemes
These are oil, flax and hemp and tobacco.
We do not want to turn farmers into bureaucrats.
This situation creates various control limits.
It is extremely important.
This is welcome.
That is a lot of money.
My group will of course support it.
That alone is not enough.
I very much doubt it.
What we are looking for here is subsidiarity.
We cannot carry out all the checks from Brussels.
There is no problem there.
Just one brief observation, Commissioner.
We will be glad to support you on this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m.
Nuts and locust beans
The tariff for hazelnuts stands at 3.3%.
This system involved a significant financial commitment.
In my opinion, there have been three changes.
Firstly, the competition conditions have changed.
They are not the same as ten years ago.
Brussels does not want to be involved.
The fixed aid for hazelnuts in 1996 was temporary.
We are importing.
We must prevent a rural exodus.
Our honey over Chinese, Canadian or Mexican honey.
That is quite right.
We need to be very clear about that here.
I have explained that there are new options.
You cannot be right on both counts.
You cannot have it both ways!
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)
Mr President, on a point of order.
I should also like to say this.
(Applause)
I call on all colleagues to do likewise.
Mr Van Hulten had better start saving up now!
(Applause)
We will certainly note your suggestion.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
The Minutes are correct in this respect.
I take note of your comment, Mrs Berger.
I should like to draw that to your attention.
Thank you for bringing this to our attention.
(The Minutes were approved)
Vote
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)Explanation of vote
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
Of course I voted for the report.
Casaca report (A5-0137/2000)
Decisions are far too centralised.
This is staggering news.
We must not be content with paper exercises.
This is a political issue.
We must take advantage of an opportunity like this.
I also have memories of other Community institutions.
I would like to thank both the rapporteurs.
They have done a good, serious job.
They have asked very serious questions.
That must be our starting-point.
Mr Blokland said that we should not include Turkey.
They want to address this problem.
Of course, there is not enough being done.
There needs to be more progress.
I congratulate Mr Sousa Pinto and Mr Turco.
But there never will be a drug-free society.
European drugs policy therefore needs a new guiding principle.
This principle is called damage limitation.
We must fight against it.
I support the amendments.
There are two comments I would like to make.
How can we monitor the accuracy of the data?
Let me comment on that first of all.
I myself come from Sweden.
The drug trade is not confined by national borders.
The same applies to cooperation with Norway.
However, our two proposals are much more comprehensive.
There are two reasons for this.
Let there be no mistake about that.
The joint debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Report (A5-0147/2000)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Report (A5-0157/2000)
Following the vote on the Commission proposal.
I therefore call upon Parliament to postpone the vote.
Community design
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
On the contrary, it is urgently needed.
Rapid decision-making is a legitimate aim.
Now we are repeating past bad practice.
Application of Community law (1998)
.
I therefore support this amendment.
.
A general campaign is needed here.
And so indeed it must.
I should like to say this in conclusion.
That is wrong; they voted in favour.
But I must admit my mistake.
.
I was at a conference last week.
Permit me to highlight the salient points.
The Commission' s aims are two-fold here.
Two final comments.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
This is why we absolutely cannot accept this report.
It is a question of respecting national sovereignty.
.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 12 noon)
Resumption of the session
Tribute
Pierre Pflimlin was a true statesman.
For Pierre Pflimlin was also a man of dialogue.
Statement by the President
This was on 18 June.
The legal bases for action are in place.
All we need is genuine political will.
Action must be taken now.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mr Tajani.
I see that you agree to this suggestion.
Thank you.
This bill has not yet been adopted.
It was an excellent day out in Rotterdam.
The atmosphere was anything but hostile.
There has been a change of power there.
Thank you, Mr Blak.
Agenda
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
Here the issue is Tibet.
We know how important this is.
In 1992 I personally produced a report on Tibet.
(Parliament rejected the request)
President.
We shall examine each of these requests in turn.
It is an old and yet highly topical matter.
This is our opportunity to do so.
I would find this totally unacceptable.
Everyone has heard the suggestion.
This also applies here, to Iraq.
All the issues are covered.
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
Indeed this has already been demonstrated on several occasions.
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
I am rather torn.
Madam President, this is a point of order.
We wanted to have fewer overall.
But I will be brief.
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
European Council/Portuguese presidency
This is not a final decision.
Military staff have been appointed.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr President.
(Applause)
(Laughter)
The Commission has been working energetically in this area.
We welcome the positive outcome.
We welcome the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
I just want to add a couple of points.
India is the greatest democracy in the world.
Obviously we need to have some important political debates.
(Applause)
This should have been done at Feira.
In this respect we cannot invoke banking secrecy.
Fine.
Indeed, we must.
Many of these were already left unresolved in Amsterdam.
It was a disappointment for that very reason.
I am referring to the revision of the Treaties.
Austria held elections and will continue to do so.
Free elections.
Today there is growing embarrassment.
We shall see!
What kind of madness is this?
Where is the sense in such a contradiction?
This is not the Europe to which we belong.
We must tackle the issue of China.
Absolutely everything is based on an intergovernmental approach.
We cannot ask Mr Solana questions.
This will be the enduring image of Feira.
Why does this matter?
This must be noted.
Firstly, it has adopted a new political stance.
I should like briefly to make three points.
But no mention was made of this in Feira.
A strange order in which to do things.
And it is certainly not the present structure.
I have two comments to make on this.
I hope not.
Employment policy is short-sighted and biased towards the market.
I cannot therefore allow you to speak any further.
I am not referring to an economic government.
Portugal has helped e-Europe to make progress.
Follow the example of the United States for once.
Lifelong learning is the responsibility of the Member States.
On-line access for companies.
This is a scandal.
It was possible to sign real agreements.
We need cooperation between European and Indian companies.
We have shared values.
That would have made the exercise easier.
The conclusion reached postpones the problem for 10 years.
The processes must therefore run parallel.
There is nothing controversial about that.
We must show what kind of EU we want.
Nothing new has been added.
We are delighted about the formulations concerning enlargement.
We should like to have seen more concrete results.
It is a welcome and wholly necessary debate.
Minimum reforms in Nice will not be enough.
Our citizens expect something more.
We need to discuss the issues surrounding a constitution.
The baton has now been handed over to France.
As MEPs we are still far from satisfied.
.
Secondly, the Intergovernmental Conference.
This report identifies these options very clearly.
The Lisbon Summit laid down a strategy.
I would like to make it quite clear...
...
Money laundering
This has now been done.
I believe that we have succeeded in doing so.
This would make the job impossible.
We rectify this in the amendments.
Unfortunately we did not succeed.
But it was not Parliament's fault.
The rapporteur is right there.
But there are also exceptions.
A great deal of work needs to be done.
Otherwise, I think we are wasting our time.
They have been particularly successful.
We should learn from that experience.
The situation has changed.
Organised crime is using new kinds of businesses.
But in truth it means something different.
This is called money laundering.
Dirty money is turned into respectable money.
It must not come to that!
That is what we are discussing this evening.
This applies to Amendments Nos 4 and 12.
Amendments Nos 21 and 22.
Amendments Nos 9, 10, 13 and 14.
I refer to Amendment No 9.
Amendment No 10 makes reference to this.
Amendment No 11.
Amendment No 23.
Amendment No 24.
Amendments Nos 31, 32, 41 en 43.
Amendment No 34.
Amendment No 38.
Amendments Nos 7, 8, 16 and 45.
Amendment No 20.
This aspect must be left to the Member States.
Amendments Nos 27, 28 and 29.
Amendment No 35.
Amendment No 36.
Amendment No 39.
Amendment No 40.
Finally, Amendment No 42.
The debate is closed.
Safe harbour privacy principles
The opposing position is unrealistic.
We do not have that option.
What is our intention?
But you would have my support, anyway.
However, it does not benefit the citizens.
Let us turn now to the Safe Harbour.
And it is going to work.
And neither does this rule out legal proceedings.
Lastly, cancellation.
I will end, Mr President.
If we do that, then what will happen?
They have their way and we have ours.
I wish we had that within our European Union.
Conditionality will mean no protection now.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Our decision is unilateral.
So the chicken-and-egg analogy is irrelevant.
And that is no great loss to my mind.
We must get this issue in proportion.
I would like to leave it there.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Visas
, rapporteur.
We then instituted legal action.
The Council regulation concerned was declared null and void.
We see this as a step forward.
What is this?
I rejected this.
Now it is the Council's turn.
Amendment No. 2 is important.
We can also accept Amendments Nos 1 and 5.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.45 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
Yesterday evening I raised two points.
One was on the success of Euro 2000.
I do not see that minuted.
Could you change that please?
It took me 12 hours to get to Strasbourg.
But things cannot go on like this.
Thank you, Mr Camre.
(The Minutes were approved)
1998 discharge
The next item is the joint debate on:
He said it does not work for development assistance.
Christmas is not for six months.
What were the main shortcomings?
This concerns the future and the past.
The same applies to information issues.
(Applause from the right)
We are responding to that request.
You insisted on it, we are responding.
I wish the Commission every success in advance.
Round one to us, the anti-PPE alliance.
She lost.
Round two to the anti-PPE alliance.
Round three to the anti-PPE alliance.
Can you give us these figures, please?
We lack regulation.
We believe that the Commission is taking its time.
That is not the case here.
I think we have done an excellent job.
This practice has been appalling.
It is a matter of some importance.
This Parliament has no clear majority or minority.
We shall therefore grant the discharge.
Let us reject it tomorrow.
But where to now?
You are not speaking into the microphone.
(Applause)
It is 4 July today.
Let us cut across party lines and national allegiances.
It is they who must improve their books.
The storm gradually died down.
But it was still a good outcome.
We have long memories though!
(Applause from the right)
That is my first point.
The second point is in relation to FlÃ©chard.
(Loud applause)
It is a success.
It is vital that the citizens accept the euro.
Let us achieve a Europe of the people.
We all have the Dover tragedy in mind.
I shall have the opportunity to stress this point.
This legislation must be put into practice and developed.
Europe must be strong and open to the world.
This is precisely what is at issue.
The European Parliament also shares these concerns.
(Applause)
We must heed this call.
This is the essential precondition for enlargement.
We have faith in you.
We wish you every success for the Presidency.
We are proud that both men were Christian Democrats.
(Applause)
Furthermore, we want a strong Commission.
(Applause)
Then there is the European Court of Justice.
(Applause)
It is not enough just to extend majority voting.
It bodes well for your presidency.
I wish you every success.
(Applause)
He criticised decision making behind closed doors.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We think this must be included in the package.
This is an absolute priority!
(Loud applause)
(Loud Applause)
Both make important contributions to the European debate.
The Europe of tomorrow matters to all of us.
Much in the European debate is unsettled.
We certainly agree with that.
None of these things are characteristic of intergovernmentalism.
It is important to give that reassurance.
This reform must be ambitious.
The European Union must take the offensive.
Our pattern of development is in question.
(Applause)
It is a real problem.
(Mixed reactions)
This is where ...
Is that not right, Mr Cohn-Bendit?
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is not acceptable.
Does defending the national interest make one anti-European?
The 'blues' showed us the way.
I appreciated it greatly.
He mentioned a number of subjects.
I said this to Mr Prodi.
That goes without saying.
(Applause)
(Applause)
He also mentioned the charter of rights.
(Applause)
We should await their conclusions on this subject.
If it is possible, so much the better.
My response is similar.
Enlargement is not a political decision.
There is no doubt about it.
(Applause)
Mr Lannoye specifically mentioned the problem of closer cooperation.
I have just answered this.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
We must respond to the concerns of everyday life.
So, there has been some progress.
I have expressed my views on globalisation.
Europe is open, by definition.
Finally, Mr Wurtz mentioned the notorious Tobin tax.
(Laughter and applause)
(Laughter and applause)
(Applause)
Decisions must be taken at the right level.
(Loud applause)
We shall carry on with our debate.
Madam President, you could not be more wrong.
President Chirac spoke for one and a quarter hours.
They aspire to see Europe operating better.
We consider this to be an essential point.
They cannot comprehend our reluctance in this area.
We need progress here.
This would be a great disappointment.
Who does what?
It sounds good but what does it actually mean?
That is precisely the problem!
Europe is democratically bankrupt.
That is the funny side of it.
This is no longer the case.
This would be a missed opportunity for us.
It must be launched at Nice.
That is absolutely fine.
The spotlight is on the extension of majority voting.
There is a lot one can agree with.
Where exactly does the EU stand?
What was the reason for its action?
Global warming is one such problem.
President Prodi reiterated these points.
We support these proposals.
All of these are federal characteristics.
This depends on what you mean.
There is no hard core.
These are the two crucial points for the IGC.
Do this at Nice then, and not afterwards.
Firstly, closer cooperation and integration.
We are leaving it for the future.
I leave that question open.
I will end here.
Let us focus on the task in hand.
Let us see this IGC through with ambition.
Our position is quite clear.
Our obligation concerns the means, not the outcome.
We hope that we will have a large response.
Thank you very much.
Delegation of EU observers at the Zimbabwean elections
The vote-counting processes were not cause for controversy either.
They have all done a magnificent job.
Zimbabwe is plainly at a crossroads.
We have considerable influence as a major donor.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten
It can thus now go ahead.
Hopefully this will change.
Thank you very much for your kind words.
People did vote in great numbers.
I will be more specific.
The opposition press only reached the urban population.
More farms have been occupied since the elections.
The Archbishop of Bulawayo has received death threats.
It is probably a combination of both things.
We must give decisive support to its future.
I pay great tribute to him.
Mr Mugabe has much to answer for.
The Archbishop of Bulawayo has been threatened.
All these things must be stopped.
This will not take place under the present regime.
I know Zimbabwe quite well.
This cannot be made good overnight.
It is a matter of dialogue.
Thank you very much, Minister
The debate is closed.
Trafficking in human beings
That is not all, however.
We must therefore combat these smugglers first of all.
I am thinking here of Morocco.
This issue also involves the fight against organised crime.
Unfortunately, however, they do exist.
And organised crime is exploiting that situation.
Unfortunately they are nothing new.
It is high time we adopted policy.
So what should we do?
Minister Queyranne and Commissioner Vitorino already mentioned it.
We need to tackle the causes.
But I would like to point out something else.
Mr President, there has been enough talk.
It is time for action!
These are terrifying figures.
That is the question.
The trade in smuggling human beings is undeniably flourishing.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We do not wish to fall into this trap.
So what is to be done?
All of this is interconnected.
Anything else is mere verbiage and preaching.
This appalling incident was avoidable.
Accordingly, they alerted the port authorities at Dover.
He spoke about the real culprits, the organizers.
And their prospects?
Minister, Commissioner, you have truly disappointed me.
And the Chinese must be able to speak out.
I have experienced this first hand.
They are scarred for life.
They cannot go back.
Permit me just to add a second question.
But these are not enough.
I think that this would be unrealistic.
This deadline was not set for the Nice Council.
The Commission can reassure you on this point.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
1998 discharge (continuation)
Commission.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
LIFE
It is undeniably important for LIFE to be adopted.
LIFE III will therefore be operational before the summer.
Congratulations to the rapporteur.
Spot the deliberate mistake.
We shall therefore vote against this report.
The original Commission proposal dates back to December 1998.
But LIFE has special goals of its own.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30.
2001 budget (conciliation procedure)
That is precisely the stage we are at now.
This advice will be clear and unequivocal.
We need to try to use the budget efficiently.
Our committee tabled two amendments for the report.
Amendment No 20 concerns innovative measures.
Innovation must therefore be adequately supported.
That may sound very sensible.
.
That is only just now coming through.
I hope the Commissioner will take that on board.
My third point concerns the debate about personnel.
My second point concerns the international agreements.
But we maintain a sense of realism.
No more, no less.
This morning, we talked about the 1998 discharge.
This results in a classification according to DAC sectors.
I have two final observations.
I congratulate Mrs Haug on her fine work.
Let us get that point clear.
They have failed to do that.
That makes it pretty difficult.
I am pretty sure Parliament has a position now.
Its total value is EUR 5.5 billion.
My groups welcomes this development.
This must stop.
It must be seen as highly negative.
This will impinge on us all.
The Council' s short-sightedness hinders any logical solution.
Just imagine.
That is no way to make progress.
Let us not push things to the limit.
That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0518/00):
That is what Question Time is for.
Question No 2 by (H-0519/00):
Is the Council aware of this scheme?
Council.
Thank you for your response, Minister.
Question No 3 by (H-0525/00):
.
Mr President, I am disappointed with that response.
Question No 4 by (H-0531/00):
.
That is the question.
That is the nub of the problem.
Question No 6 by (H-0539/00):
The Iraqi Government is chiefly responsible for this.
This is the difficult path we must now take.
The Council has decided not to answer them.
Subject: Non-allied status of certain EU Member States
There is no problem between Parliament and the Commission.
Is yours the same interpretation?
Question No 8 by (H-0545/00):
You have demonstrated this in your reply.
Question No 9 by (H-0552/00):
My response to that will be extremely brief.
.
We are not all uneducated and illiterate.
These are short-term teething troubles.
.
Subject: International Criminal Court
.
Question No 12 by (H-0556/00):
I was merely giving you a progress report.
Question No 16 by (H-0565/00):
I had understood the question perfectly.
Question No 17 by (H-0569/00):
I wish you every success.
I am also suffering.
These summer colds need a lot of attention.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
Draft supplementary and amending budgets (SAB) for 2000
Mr President, draft supplementary and amending budget no.
The Council' s budget is EUR 6.635 million.
A big problem will be future budget technology.
External Action - which is already now overburdened?
And no-one wants that.
We need 20 million.
Allow me to make one comment to the Council.
I would like to raise three issues about this.
I believe this has been pushed to its limit.
That will surely be as safe as Fort Knox.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
Liberalisation of energy markets
We advise that this implementation be accelerated.
We want to ensure that this remains the case.
My fourth point concerns regulators.
That is an important point in this process.
I hope that will be supported.
It is up to them to decide.
That needs to be rectified very quickly.
I welcome proposals for network access for renewable energies.
Yet the Commission is not tackling this head on.
Perhaps it is afraid.
I have discussed this with Commissioner Monti.
Without doubt, electricity prices have fallen.
Such facts do not fit in with liberalisation mania.
Private sector provision has delivered the goods.
I do not favour price reduction over security.
Firstly, the value of strong regulatory authorities.
Secondly, the value of a timetable.
Everywhere you look employees rights are under threat.
Who will benefit from this and how exactly?
Energy is a basic need.
That is the first thing.
It has improved thanks to international competition.
Mr Mombaur pointed that out just now.
Professor Monti has announced this.
That is just the problem with this issue.
The Commission must reconsider its position.
However, the benefits have outweighed the problems encountered.
Hydro-electricity is a form of renewable energy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Community railway undertakings
We still have a long debate ahead of us.
I beg you to keep to the speaking times.
We are most grateful for that.
So what are our most important proposed amendments?
Another factor is the question of track charges.
We talk about globalisation.
It also means that there can be no derogations.
The pricing system is an important issue.
How much should be charged for the capacity allocated?
There are two schools of thought here.
I should like to mention one last point.
That does not present any particular problem.
But the Council must also show willing.
The first conclusion concerns the liberalisation of the railways.
The second message concerns the Council.
They either have to change or die.
That must change, and I believe it will.
Those basic safeguards must be restored.
That is an achievable goal.
Let us not throw it away.
I do not really share Mr Watts' view.
Secondly, who can apply for a licence?
In fact, safety should come first.
The fewer bodies involved, the better.
I speak for my own country of Ireland.
I believe it could send out the wrong signals.
We therefore harbour grave reservations about supporting these directives.
I could not agree more.
I believe Mr Jarzembowski is quite mistaken.
In other regions, they remained a monopoly.
This reality renders the proposals made by Jarzembowski unviable.
Liberalisation should, however, work both ways.
Members of the European Parliament are not very famous.
Who can argue with that?
The figures speak for themselves.
Every example in related sectors confirms the argument.
One step at a time gets you nowhere.
By far the biggest is road transport.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Recognition of professional qualifications
It is time for improvements here.
I should like to address one more point.
Two other amendments have been proposed concerning Irish architects.
They are after all more subtle and sophisticated.
Thank you for listening.
This is extremely important.
I am very happy to support this report.
These days we are always talking about mobility.
But the devil is in the detail.
But people no longer understand this.
Is this a citizens' Europe?
Is this a common market?
These are the questions.
The cost of the validation process also warrants discussion.
This concludes my response.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
.
I shall look into this.
(The Minutes were approved)
This issue is now before the courts in Ireland.
They are very sad happenings indeed.
ECB annual report
Forecasts themselves have important shortcomings.
We are aware of these shortcomings.
Other models will be published in the near future.
We need to counter that trend here today.
What caused this initial drop in the exchange rate?
Secondly, the euro is a new currency.
First, the 1999 annual report.
Inflation is there, sure enough, Mr Duisenberg!
I hope to see better coordination between European policies.
(The President cut the speaker off)
His efforts are commendable.
Its message is doomed to failure.
It will be because the dollar has fallen.
But the ECB is not privately owned.
There is a second problem that worries me.
Yes, and why not?
There is a second problem that worries me.
(Applause)
Theirs was no easy task.
It advocates wage restraint, flexibility and job insecurity.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This revision would appear to be overdue.
Allow me to share my conviction with you.
(Applause)
There has to be more transparency, however.
This is also important.
I will go further.
However, I would like to add something.
The one follows almost inevitably from the other.
Mr President.
Unemployment will fall over the next two years.
Thank you, Mr Duisenberg.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Implementation of EMU
So SMEs are the priority for autumn 2000.
It was very successful at that point.
This has not happened during this new parliamentary term.
That is my first point.
We also need to prepare for the euro psychologically.
The first is decentralisation.
Mr President, there are three countries outside EMU.
Or, in a nutshell, manipulation.
We will not be manipulated.
This is a most deplorable report.
The changeover will require an effort.
Unfortunately, I cannot escape this here, either.
If the cap fits, wear it.
Surely no-one could challenge the need for information.
I certainly wish the euro well.
The debate is suspended.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
The debate will be resumed this afternoon.
Vote
FÃ¤rm (PSE), rapporteur.
The help of the EU is required for this.
So my reply is 'yes' .
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
This has also been the case this time.
Yes or no?
.
(FR) My answer is yes.
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
Procedure without debate
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament approved the joint text)
Before the vote:
Before the vote:
In our opinion, this is absolutely intolerable.
(Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote)
President.
They also concern the passing on of confidential information.
The negotiation has been very long.
Madam President, it falls to you to conclude.
Madam President, that would be a step forward.
We were astonished by the Council' s intervention.
The negotiations for this framework agreement have been tortuous.
I should like to begin by correcting a misunderstanding.
It is a humiliating situation which is completely unacceptable.
(Applause
(Parliament adopted the framework agreement)
President.
The European Parliament is an important body.
Mr Lannoye, we cannot open a debate now.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Parliament adopted the decision)
(Parliament adopted the decision)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The people of Cyprus are clearly being wronged here.
Schmid report (A5-0176/2000)
Lienemann report (A5-0172/2000)
.
Jarzembowski report (A5-0173/2000)
I can think of different ways to achieve this.
This is therefore a matter of urgency.
Swoboda report (A5-0171/2000)
.
With reference to the Swoboda and Jarzembowski reports
Wieland report (A5-0174/2000)
These people cannot afford to buy medicine.
The Council rejected all our proposed amendments.
This is why I have naturally voted against.
These incidents are no accident.
The framework agreement restricts this provision.
.
This is why I have abstained from the vote.
.
Why, in fact, are we constructing Europe?
To be stronger, more independent, richer?
Obviously, the answer is yes.
Lehne report (A5-0175/2000)
Mr President, the Lehne report on money laundering.
But organised crime embraces a great deal more.
This is why I abstained from the vote.
Are the profits from the arms trade clean money?
Just a few figures suffice to substantiate this position.
This seminar culminated in the 'Bercy recommendations' .
.
.
That is why I am abstaining.
SubsidiaritÃ© oblige!
Lehne report (A5-0179/2000)
We must take steps to amend this regulation.
1.
2.
Europe needs to change its attitude to immigration.
Haug report (A5-0184/2000)
.
Paciotti report (A5-0177/2000)
We are now going backwards.
.
Will it be possible to take them to court?
Will they have to pay compensation?
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Implementation of EMU (continuation)
Every newspaper I open has stories about the euro.
The very idea is absurd.
Two additional comments.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Use of certain dangerous substances and preparations
But anyway, it is now before us.
They say that we still need proof.
Excuse me, just what proof do we need?
That is what I call cynical!
I consider that this would be extremely unfortunate.
Why are these risks accepted and not others?
Was it done in a balanced way?
The precautionary principle should rule.
We must take the precautionary approach.
Let me make a second comment.
Let us try tomorrow to rectify our past mistakes.
We have enough information to make the necessary decisions.
The precautionary principle must be applied!
The Commission's proposal is neither sensible nor sufficient.
The answer is no-one.
Who says there could remotely be a risk?
So, what does the CSTEE say about this?
The CSTEE met and decided on 25 November.
Why is the Commission rushing forward now?
Crying wolf damages the credibility of the precautionary principle.
I think the argument is completely unacceptable.
I think that would be a sensible health policy.
What we therefore have is a thoroughly unsatisfactory proposal.
You can cry wolf once too often.
As legislators, we cannot use excessive force.
The labelling of toys alone is not sufficiently safe.
They are entirely within their rights, of course.
The Commission's temporary bans have no legal basis.
No, we do not.
We subsidise it with millions of euros.
Honesty and transparency have been sacrificed to expedience.
We hear far too much about the precautionary principle.
The Commission's proposed directive consists of two elements.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Beef and beef products
It is already a highly technical and unwieldy system.
This endeavour started four years ago.
The monitoring system has been strengthened.
What he cannot do is to confuse the two.
Firstly it ensures traceability of beef products.
I will now comment on the amendments.
Clearly this is a ridiculous situation.
This is a subsidiarity issue.
There is no time for conciliation.
Mr President, this proposal has a long history.
However, we are almost at the end.
The Commission knows why.
We have done that with a good grace.
We are not prepared to do that.
Let us hear them.
This is where we need to get to.
Consumer confidence however, requires more than traceability.
The whole itinerary?
Or just 'Origin: European Union' ?
So, today, we are offered a compromise.
It all started with milk quotas back in 1984.
Soon labels will no longer suffice.
Perhaps even Macdonald's might be forced to protest.
I will make a prediction.
Mr Chirac is going to be disappointed.
The people are despairing.
It could be exactly the same again today.
There are two very different issues here.
He is quite right!
I cannot support its inclusion.
I am afraid I cannot follow this either.
In my view, this amendment lacks precision.
How is 'origin' to be defined here?
Exactly how will origin be indicated?
Already there is some evidence that this is happening.
Labelling, however, needs to be sensible.
Over-description would only lead to confusion and is unnecessary.
Mr President, that went quicker than I thought.
Politicians need to take this into consideration.
Let the Commission and the Council do theirs!
It is good that categories have been removed.
Where was the animal born?
And then there is the debate about categories.
We should not make the legislation unnecessarily complicated.
That is not the case in my country.
We have discussed this at length in committee.
Designation of origin is particularly important for consumers.
But what about those sometimes excessively detailed descriptions?
They are confusing.
This is not acceptable.
The French situation is amazing.
What is it saying about the Anglo-French beef issue?
The indication of categories is not necessary at all.
It is not even a food safety issue.
So they know what they have to do.
This took place on 3 May.
That is the effect it would have.
That is all.
But that would be another kettle of fish.
Surely that is not the idea.
I would now like to make two brief points.
We cannot accept that, it would be counterproductive.
You see, it can work!
Colleagues, I recognise there is a difficulty.
The matter is not yet satisfactorily resolved.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
Proposal for a regulation on a Community patent
That is an ambitious goal.
I believe that this is a great achievement.
That exists now and will continue to exist.
That is why it is called the Community patent.
We cannot have it both ways.
We cannot have our cake and eat it.
Secondly there are national patent offices.
This is a special field subject to special arrangements.
I would like to ask him four questions.
Would this cause a real problem?
Is that a problem?
Perhaps I may deal with them one by one.
The same Member of Parliament asked about jurisdiction.
Obviously this is to the detriment of European competitiveness.
Question Time (Commission)
We will examine questions to the Commission.
First part
Question No 25 by (H-0549/00):
We all want to combat cyber crime.
Nobody has yet found the right answer.
Question No 27 by (H-0543/00):
Question No 28 by (H-0555/00):
Question No 29 by (H-0560/00):
Commission.
Commission.
This is one of our current objectives.
Second part
Questions to Mr Nielson
Question No 30 by (H-0524/00):
Question No 31 by (H-0540/00):
This is clear to everybody.
Question No 32 by (H-0567/00):
Thankfully they were safely evacuated.
Well that did not hurt, did it?
I have been waiting five months for that reply.
Why?
Question No 33 by (H-0573/00):
So we are quite pleased.
Thank you very much, Mr Nielson.
Questions to Mr Barnier
Question No 35 by (H-0523/00):
That is one part of my reply.
Mr MacCormick, thank you for highlighting this point.
I am not a fatalist.
That is our problem.
That is what Mr MacCormick has highlighted.
Question No 36 by (H-0528/00):
Question No 37 by (H-0544/00):
Questions to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m
Is Mr Barnier aware of this problem?
What can he do in this direction?
I want to go and see for myself.
I spent last week in a region of Finland.
I prefer education.
Question No 42 by (H-0521/00):
They change the boundaries whenever they feel like it.
Question No 43 by (H-0529/00):
But the question remains.
There is an application before the Court.
Of course we are worried.
Unfortunately Greece has not done this properly.
I should like to put two questions to you.
Toxic waste is an extremely important issue.
Which specific areas of Community legislation are causing problems?
Question No 44 by (H-0547/00):
Commission.
This directive must be enforced completely before November 2007.
Commission.
Commission.
Question No 45 by (H-0548/00):
We will not sit on our hands.
EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme)
These are binding specifications which set excessively difficult targets.
That surely serves no purpose at all.
They cannot do that if annual validation is required.
EMAS is complex, too complex.
I cannot understand the reluctance to accept this.
It really is an essential instrument.
We are never going to make any advances otherwise.
For that reason we need to set a standard.
EMAS is, however, a voluntary system.
How frequently is the environmental statement to be validated?
Allow me to turn now to the individual amendments.
Unanimity and openness are also important principles for EMAS.
Thank you, Madam Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide
Our Group would have warmly welcomed that.
We should also like to congratulate the rapporteur.
The Commission is therefore unable to approve Amendment 4.
Thank you, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Environmental inspections
That really is all that a recommendation is.
I recognise the Commission's worries.
They want a directive and not a recommendation.
We do not need that kind of supra-national inspectorate.
Why do they not know?
A recommendation will do no good.
There is also a question for Member States.
They get inspected.
Action is taken.
They are forced to clean up their act.
They pay the price for that.
It is simply unfair.
We do not want to see this abandoned.
We want to see results.
A recommendation will achieve something.
Thank you, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Protection of forests
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you very much, Mr President.
I would like to give just two recent examples.
That is why we are going to support her.
On the contrary.
We need more fires.
We set fires for ecological reasons.
It is therefore extremely important.
Geographers understand this very well.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
We note that with gratitude.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
MEDIA/MEDIA Plus
The cross-border distribution of European films remains too limited.
We need two additional instruments.
What is on offer here is therefore insufficient.
We have concentrated on the key points.
The Council should be called to account here.
Competitiveness and marketability are commendable aims of MEDIA Plus.
Big cinema needs big money.
The plan is indeed sound.
I do wonder.
This is hardly ever discussed.
This programme does not even take production into account.
Naturally, the intention is not to squander subsidies.
Indeed not.
That must change.
Cultural diversity is not a slogan.
It is a cultural and economic necessity.
I think not.
Firstly, why do we need this programme?
Why do we need it?
I believe we are able to do that.
I do not think this is the case.
That system is completely obsolete.
There are two simple points I want to make.
Certainly the public sector cannot make good films.
We need to very careful about that.
We should not forget the radio sector in audio-visual.
It is much harder to give a short speech.
This needs to be re-emphasised.
We usually do congratulate the rapporteur.
It is traditional.
Thank you very much, Mrs Hieronymi.
That is not, however, enough.
We are working to recreate such a fund.
So I need not go over it again.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Quality evaluation in school education
I thank you all for your very constructive attitude.
I thank you and look forward to your reactions.
Often education attracts fine words.
Quality evaluation is one of those.
What they were looking at were their baccalaureate results.
So we think nothing about evaluating youngsters.
Where are those young people going to come from?
They need to be offered appropriate teaching.
No child is devoid of talent.
Every system creates its own type of failures.
The criteria for identifying failure are essentially subjective.
Success is judged according to pre-established standards.
What are those standards?
How have they been established?
I shall move on now to a technical point.
We shall vote on our report tomorrow.
This is the path we must pursue.
We must breathe life into those Lisbon declarations.
That is already the case.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
His behaviour is a disgrace and a scandal.
Has he no shame?
Has he no respect?
Has he no decency or honour at all?
So far, he has refused to comment.
We finally approved a three-point statement.
Very well, Mr Seguro.
I will certainly inform President Fontaine.
Certainly, Mr Lehne.
You gave ample clarification of the matter yesterday.
And I am quite happy to support it.
(Laughter and applause)
(The Minutes were approved)
Welcome
The meetings commenced yesterday and will continue throughout today.
Committee on Petitions - European Ombudsman
In 1999 we made ten draft recommendations.
Thank you for your attention.
I wish to express our thanks.
That is not unusual.
Some of our ideas are mentioned in this report.
I commend the report to the House.
Citizens want to see good administration.
They want to be active citizens.
No administration or institution is infallible.
I turn now to the Ombudsman.
There are therefore not even any amendments.
Seventy-seven per cent of complaints received concern the Commission.
Transparency is an effective weapon against fraud and corruption.
In that he has our full support.
I would like to state seven principles.
I would like to make one more important point.
Thank you for your work!
By nature they tend to be secretive.
It does not have adequate secretarial assistance.
It is simply not good enough.
It is not always the Commission' s fault.
Its tasks are different from those of law courts.
The committee work can start.
This is now before Parliament.
Thank you kindly, Mr SÃ¶derman.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Single European sky
We cannot put it off any longer.
It needs attention now.
That may be right for us.
It may be wrong for others.
This cannot last any longer.
We must address this issue now.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That brings me back to the last speaker.
Nor is that in any way a problem.
There may still be some resistance in individual countries.
We share her objectives, we support her aims.
Eurocontrol too must be reformed and revamped and relaunched.
Between 1986 and 1996 air traffic in Europe doubled.
It will double again in the coming ten years.
We need to tackle the issue at European level.
Nobody should compromise on safety.
Consider the facts.
Why?
But what is the value of such a measure?
But that is not what is being proposed.
The system is highly effective.
On what grounds would you want to break...
(The President cut the speaker off)
We should tailor our policy accordingly.
We are not that far advanced yet.
Passengers go missing.
Invariably they cause delays as much as air traffic.
The issue of Eurocontrol is important.
Finally, there are some TDI amendments with this.
I am particularly interested in Amendment No 24.
I can only assume that the TDI group must...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Flights were cancelled, and many were severely delayed.
This situation is absolutely intolerable.
First of all, the matter of safety.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I say no.
No to a complete overhaul of Eurocontrol.
These are the fundamental causes of air delays.
This is something we must never put up with.
The report lays down an extremely tight timetable.
I share this ambition.
We all suffer from delays that often last hours.
Let me remind you of another aspect.
Safety standards must on no account be endangered.
That is the timetable.
Let us not get into this argument.
That is not the aim of this initiative.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Health and safety of pregnant workers
There is a considerable need to improve the legislation.
Here we must avoid any risks.
The question of reinstatement also needs to be clarified.
I very much agree with the rapporteur about this.
The report mainly focuses on institutional aspects.
We have a good example of this here.
I am not so sure.
It needs to be re-done.
We must know whether the legislation is working.
Modernisation and efforts in this area are therefore important.
They cannot be left to the Member States.
This is completely unacceptable!
How much detail should we go into?
In this connection, the report contains an imbalance.
I hope that Parliament will adopt this amendment.
The new legislation must be clear and progressive.
I like some of the suggestions in her report.
It is very much a traditional socialist agenda.
Neither of these are really health and safety issues.
Hence we urge the House to reject the report.
That is the reason for the delay in presentation.
This previous system has now been changed.
I have not been consulted about this.
And so I am stuck!
I have taken note of your request.
That would be something else!
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
Maat (PPE-DE).
I would appreciate an answer to both questions.
Once again, many thanks for your cooperation!
Commission.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the draft resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This sixth indent concerns our group.
Fair play was given up!
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
This has not been the case today.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
First, a general observation.
That was your proposal, which was carried!
That is why this point is incorporated.
I have a final comment on compromises.
(Applause)
(Parliament adopted the draft decision)
Then the amendments could not be adopted.
Commission.
The Commission cannot accept the other amendments.
Following Amendment No 49
Commission.
(DE) The Commission cannot accept Amendment 4.
Amendments Nos 5 and 6 are not here.
I have only got four amendments here.
.
Motion for a resolution (B5-0583/2000)
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
Motion for a resolution (B5-0585/2000)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Trafficking in human beings
That is why we have withdrawn our signature.
I ask you to take note of that.
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
President.
Mr President, I respect your decision.
Voting time is suspended.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Schierhuber report (A5-0124/2000)
.
Stauner report (A5-0182/2000)
Virrankoski report (A5-0192/2000)
This is why we abstained from the Virrankoski report.
Stauner Report (A5-0190/2000)
Today I voted against that discharge.
Of course, we must not prejudge.
She gives one excuse after another.
The Community budget is not a matter of secrecy.
.
I ask you to alter the voting order accordingly.
Mr President, I understand everything you have said.
That is a decision that was taken.
I do not have any objection to this.
RÃ¼hle report (A5-0167/2000)
Mr President, I voted against the RÃ¼hle report.
.
We must keep a sense of proportion!
Kuhne report (A5-0189/2000)
Papayannakis report (A5-0193/2000)
.
They are correct.
It contributes to restoring consumer confidence.
Two types of information must be distinguished:
It fulfils a health function.
What do they want to know?
Garcia-Orcoyen Tormo report (A5-0165/2000)
.
I fully support this programme and commend this report.
Workers should receive even greater protection.
.
We should not forget this.
We will come back to that later.
.
This is reflected in all the European press.
Trafficking of human beings
.
The Dover tragedy happened between two European countries.
We must ensure the free movement of persons.
.
However, may I submit a procedural motion?
Now, we have to wait.
It is a waste of time.
Could you clarify that?
This is not the case.
What sort of a statement is this?
Topical and urgent debate
This is not like a referral back to committee.
Topical and urgent matters are a very specific case.
New arguments have emerged in this instance.
Fiji and the Solomon Islands
Why did it happen?
When we arrived we found a complete vacuum.
There was no dialogue between the warring parties.
The parliament was not functioning.
This situation is unsustainable.
We created dialogue.
That aid is 25% of their GDP.
Today, the reality is far sadder.
These two examples support our vision of the conflict.
This is how we might succeed in changing things.
Fiji had a multi-racial constitution in 1997.
The concerns expressed are very real.
That has been abolished.
It had a democratically elected government.
It even risks being expelled from the Commonwealth.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Tibet
Madam President, happy birthday Dalai Lama!
This is why this resolution is necessary.
This has to be prevented and hence this resolution.
Bilateral talks must be held with authorised leaders.
Tashi delek!
This is why I am addressing the Commissioner.
We must guard against hypocrisy.
Human rights
Child soldiers in Uganda
Situation in the Moluccas
Death penalty in the United States
Hooligans
Iraq
Child soldiers in Uganda
I would ask the House to support this resolution.
Madam President, we must also stop pussyfooting around.
Sudan must stop supporting the LRA.
The Security Council must hear this plea.
Such action is a matter of great priority.
We have a good reputation there.
Situation in the Moluccas
A humanitarian corridor is essential in this respect.
This is our urgent request.
Death penalty in the United States
Yes, Mr Manisco, you are absolutely right.
This year, this demand was repeated.
Hooliganism
Mr President, football is a festival.
Germany set a good example in this respect.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Their nationality is of little importance.
What exactly happened to the disabled Italian supporters?
Were people informed that so many would turn up?
It is absolutely not worth it.
This inquiry is under way.
Iraq
Kofi Annan is a good and honourable man.
He is still there ten years later.
We have withdrawn our signatures after all.
Is this also being distributed?
Yes, of course.
Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990.
This was wrong and unacceptable.
The UN action was justified.
This is intellectual genocide.
It is extremely important.
The infrastructure in Iraq has been completely decimated.
We cannot lose sight of them either.
This attack does not bode well for the future.
Allow me to be more specific.
Hence my explicit vote against.
Iraq deserves better than the Commission reply.
I am absolutely horrified.
That is all.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Venezuela
This issue of Venezuela is serious and urgent.
Mr President.
Only a few roads have been cleared.
This aid is directed at two things.
The results are now before us.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia
Now he (HÃ¤ider) is threatening us."
But he is not threatening anybody.
It is quite normal.
(Applause)
That is a disgraceful attitude!
Who knows the real circumstances of his resignation?
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Before the vote on child soldiers in Uganda:
Therefore the signature can stand.
Before the vote on Venezuela:
I fully understand what you are saying.
The President has already replied.
It seems to me that he is absolutely right.
I do not want any further debate.
We will look into this matter.
Vote
A written explanation of vote will be submitted.
(Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)
and
(Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
This is certainly a positive measure.
.
.
The rapporteur' s attitude is an appropriate one.
Ecosystem surveillance promises to be a multidisciplinary activity.
The heart of the problem is political, however.
We have this vicious circle scenario.
The regulations in question need political support.
But the problems have not been solved.
On the contrary, they have multiplied.
Such a policy is not merely hypocritical.
It is aiding and abetting fire.
We shall not give up.
Or for some other purpose?
g.
.
What has the European Commission proposed?
This is, of course, completely inadequate.
Hieronymi Report (A5-0186/2000)
We take note of your observation, Mr Mastorakis.
Sanders-ten Holte Report (A5-0185/2000)
.
.
Mombaur Report (A5-0180/2000)
.
We have therefore voted against this report.
.
The process is always the same.
I could carry on like this at great length.
.
We should therefore totally oppose this report.
.
Radwan Report (A5-0169/2000)
How do European leaders intend to combat this depreciation?
Karas Report (A5-0170/2000)
.
This is something that we should not support.
I reject the Karas report in its entirety.
This is where blind federalism takes us!
Lambert Report (A5-0162/2000)
.
Atkins Report (A5-0162/2000)
It is pathetic!
.
That just goes to show!
Airfares bear out this freedom too.
The current proposals do not address this problem.
From this critical stance, we tabled 11 amendments.
.
.
Why has this never been challenged?
DamiÃ£o Report (A5-0141/2000)
Maternity is not an illness.
Point 11 in particular contains many positive proposals.
Let this remain a national issue!
Certainly companies have social responsibilities.

Short sea shipping
The rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, has the floor.
We are still awaiting this report.
I would like to underline a few aspects.
Cars are a good example of this.
The sector is suffering from excessive red tape.
Procedures last forever.
Member States must lift obstructions.
The market is still fragmented at present.
Short sea shipping requires destinations.
The answer is: we have a vision.
There was broad agreement in committee.
What can we do internally for short sea shipping?
I just want to mention a few things.
Meanwhile we have the activity of the round tables.
My group endorses Amendments Nos 1 and 4 accordingly.
It still have not replied to that.
Transport policy requires choices.
I would like to highlight a number of aspects.
This is certainly true, relatively speaking.
A third aspect concerns the situation at ports.
The rapporteur is right to point this out.
That is the problem.
I expect the Commission to look into this matter.
Each area has its own particular problem.
That is what the rapporteur has been striving for.
I support Mrs Attwooll's appeal for the A75.
It is our main outlet for all we produce.
From Scotland they trundle down to England.
But it is doing well.
However there is always room for improvement.
The shipping industry is the first to acknowledge this.
Several bottlenecks hamper the development of short sea shipping.
It will even be more in the 2000.
We will increase the share up to 50%.
Mrs Peijs, thank you for your work.
Thank you very much, Mr MacCormick.
Civil dialogue
Mr Pronk has the floor.
Everyone is agreed on this.
This is not the issue.
This issue is that so little is happening.
NGOs are not restricted to one directorate general.
Speed is the main issue.
Building a Stronger Partnership" .
Mr President, I can be extremely brief.
Financial supervision could be exercised by professional auditors.
That is my first comment.
Our attempts have been ignored.
We need time for this.
Mr President, that has to change.
Let me just reply briefly to two points.
The first concerns the legal bases and the financing.
That is quite fundamental.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
(The sitting was closed at 9.08 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
We are therefore currently producing the remaining versions.
I accidentally voted against it.
I would ask you to correct this.
This has been noted.
We will therefore notify our security services.
Rule 146 was clearly cancelled out in that instance.
This will be done.
We have taken the floor on many occasions.
Vote
.
Combating serious environmental crime
How is this to happen?
That is extremely important.
This may be found in Amendment 25.
It is a classic area requiring cooperation.
Who has misled whom?
Mr President.
Moreover it is not just companies.
How long is that going to take to rectify?
The Erika is another example of negligence.
It was taken to court in India.
Then there are the issues of forestry and fishing.
The crimes are often committed by a corporate body.
They have to be prevented.
Publicity is also one way of combating environmental criminality.
Was the Erika disaster an example of environmental crime?
And what about the cyanide pollution in Romania?
It recognises the need for strong punitive sanctions.
We have to prevent criminal responsibilities from being blurred.
Major financial interests are often at stake.
This is a mission which we have to accomplish.
We would need it to be defined precisely.
However, training and certification are obviously necessary too.
We have already spoken about EMAS this week.
This cannot be allowed to continue.
I believe that this report covers three important aspects.
We believe that the crimes are often clearly premeditated.
I am in no doubt about this.
I do not.
Thirdly, the natural environment should be regenerated.
Common definitions of environmental crime are therefore also needed.
This is also included.
Thank you very much, Mrs Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Explanations of vote
This was once again borne out in this report.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
It will be duly corrected, Mrs Laguiller.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mrs Lulling, we are approving the Minutes.
(The Minutes were approved)
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 10.40 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
I have also offered the Spanish authorities our support.
Please stand and observe this minute' s silence.
There is no truth except the whole truth.
A part of reality is not sufficient by itself.
The whole is the only real truth.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Loud applause)
Tribute
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Madam President, on a point of order.
Mr Murphy, I note your statement.
I would ask you to speak to Air France.
You all received a questionnaire.
Thank you, Mrs Gillig.
Mr GarcÃ­a, I apologise.
We shall make the correction.
They do have freedom of speech.
Mrs Lynne, thank you for making this point.
These are therefore important matters.
Mr Pannella, let me reassure you straight away.
Agenda
The next item is the order of business.
Relating to Monday:
After all, the Commissioner is here!
All the language versions will be available tomorrow morning.
I see that Mr Poettering agrees with this.
Relating to Tuesday:
I want to make two points absolutely clear.
I will relay it to Commissioner Verheugen.
(Applause)
Our citizens need it and so does Parliament.
I shall put this proposal to him.
But we do not insist on this.
Relating to Wednesday:
President.
Who wishes to speak in support of this request?
That was also true of therapeutic cloning!
The votes were always controversial.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
Relating to Thursday: President.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Who wishes to speak in support of this request?
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
The order of business is adopted thus amended.
MEDA
We wish the French Presidency every success.
.
Our friends in these countries understandably question our sincerity.
Many reasons have been given for this.
I prefer to look forward.
We agree absolutely with this.
In this regard you have our support, Commissioner.
(The President cut the speaker off.)
What role does MEDA have to play in this?
More credit should be provided for smaller-scale projects.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It would be good to move on from here.
This cannot be guaranteed merely by swelling administration.
Mr Patten, stick to your guns!
Parliament ought to support you on this.
We should secure this position and defend it!
In Parliament you should have an ally here!
Meanwhile the greatest migratory impact originates from these countries.
What European policies do we have to combat desertification?
We have no clear policy on this issue.
They would simply make a few people richer.
.
It makes no sense to treat MEDA differently.
They are extremely resource-intensive in terms of management.
Let me make two final points.
That is simply not tolerable.
The joint debate is closed.
Common Community diplomacy
Therefore we cannot tolerate having ineffective diplomats in situ.
A common military force is being created.
I hope that others will also support these amendments.
What is the real issue here?
Let us be logical about this.
Unfortunately, the report does not address these issues.
These are the real questions.
The opposite is true.
Equally clearly, these alone are not enough.
We also need policies.
There is quite a lot of double-talk here tonight.
We abolish national embassies.
This is all about competition.
To do so would destabilise the global community.
Mr Patten has just made reference to this.
Management personnel is what we need in the delegations.
There is an urgent need for this.
Let us continue along these lines.
What is this really about?
There are regular meetings at all levels.
I want to underline the importance of coordination.
A final plea.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
EC investment partners financial instrument
The reason for that is simple.
The results obtained so far are encouraging.
Let me commence with a bit of background.
We need to be candid.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
Community humanitarian activities
We need to act in a wider perspective.
There we are.
There is no need to repeat anything.
I should like to expand on two problematic issues.
The first is a question of principle.
What could be more important than humanitarian emergency aid?
Payments must also be made more rapidly.
Debt service payments often exceed health and education budgets.
We must address this problem urgently.
This is a barbaric and hypocritical position.
.
Many congratulations to the honourable Member.
Mr Imbeni mentioned the important issue of visibility.
That is important.
That is our clear and ambitious goal.
I should like to end with just one reflection.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.15 p.m.)
Welcome
The front line of democracy must be defended democratically.
There can be no greater contradiction.
The Middle East
Other provisions have not been properly implemented.
On the contrary, it created new momentum.
Camp David opened up new possibilities.
This exceptional opportunity must not be wasted.
An Israeli-Palestinian agreement is indispensable.
Negotiations are under way with both Lebanon and Syria.
That is our position.
What we can we in the European Union do?
We are approaching a deadline.
It is not only a political problem.
It is a cultural, historical and religious problem.
We cannot tolerate violence in any form.
What, then, do these decisions imply?
Israel is opposed to this.
The Palestinians are prepared to compromise.
They are not demanding west Jerusalem.
The Palestinians are prepared to make concessions over territory.
Israel has the military power and US backing.
On the contrary.
The United States alone cannot provide this guarantee.
Permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999.
I can see Arafat in his grey-green military outfit.
There are precedents for this.
Discussions have certainly never progressed this far before.
But that is not enough.
This is the price for peace.
Now the taboo has been broken.
Peace is necessary.
That would be ideal.
The European institutions need to be more courageous.
Equally clearly, time is running out.
What does this role involve?
We can always wish for a more active Europe.
I too wish for a more active Europe.
So find ourselves between these two sides.
What does this role involve?
The European Union intervenes in support of the negotiations.
It constantly encourages negotiation.
What can the European Union do in this context?
There is all the action which Commissioner Patten summarised.
I heard a call for a summit meeting here.
That concludes the debate.
EU external action priorities
All these dimensions apply.
I am thinking here of Asia.
Several items were entered on the agenda.
That objective reflects a number of things.
The Euro would also come under this heading.
What does that mean in practice for the Commission?
I think we are starting to improve things.
It was evident at Evian with ministers this weekend.
Are the structures genuinely suitable?
We shall now suspend the sitting.
I can make this programme available to you.
We all know what the problem is.
Let us proceed to the vote.
Vote
(Parliament approved the resolution)
Galeote Quecedo (PPE-DE).

(Parliament approved the legislative resolution)
Explanations of vote
Dell' Alba report (A5-0202/2000)
PiÃ©trasanta report (A5-0205/2000)
What are you doing to help us?"
Galeote Quecedo report (A5-0210/2000)
.
What are we creating with this new institution?
What common interests is it supposed to defend?
This is a typically Marxist approach.
Imbeni report (A5-0191/2000)
This is unacceptable!
Has the money released been squandered?
I do not think so.
Nonetheless, humanitarian aid needs to be rationalised.
I utterly repudiate this.
Vice-President, thank you for giving me the floor.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
Actually there is no mention of what I said.
The right to exist as Basque.
I would like to amend it.
That is my protest.
This too will be included in the Verbatim Report.
We will of course examine how this has happened.
I am taking note of this now.
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
Are there any objections to this?
I would urge you to arrange this accordingly.
Mr Poettering, Parliament is sovereign.
Are there any objections?
Then the decision is as stated.
EU external action priorities (continuation)
Our second priority is the strategic aspect within MEDA.
That clearly is a farce in anyone's analysis.
My second question is this.
In my opinion, there are two:
A slapdash enlargement would obviously be a great mistake.
We will revisit this theme at a later stage.
That is what this is all about!
The priorities established deserve all our support.
We therefore now need to discuss the different issues.
First, respect for the need for identity.
If so, I can support this.
This concept I wholeheartedly reject.
They have never been asked in honest terms.
But this is only half the problem.
But how much real responsibility will they have?
The debate is closed.
Financial year 2001
The situation is sensitive, but not chaotic.
I hope to enlist your support in this matter.
The Commission believes this to be unacceptable.
Our findings are now available to you.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
We will certainly need energy and patience.
I can give good examples.
That is the positive side.
I will say what I said at the conciliation.
The reality is it is guesswork on your part.
Our worry is what happens to the backlog?
It has to be paid some time.
Is this another matter of horse-trading?
We now have a EUR 39 million cut.
We have a joint role in this matter.
The letter of amendment is quite a significant document.
That would help us tremendously.
I will start with the European Court of Justice.
Turning now to the European Court of Auditors.
That is something else we need to discuss.
The same applies to the Committee of the Regions.
I am only able to mention one interesting aspect.
There is not a great deal to add here.
So far, so good.
So what exactly are the problematic areas?
Where do Parliament and the Council differ?
It obviously prefers a hand-to-mouth existence.
No revision!
That is the name of the game.
The Commissioner made the same point.
Its aim is to reduce expenditure.
Aids
The most tragic consequences are in Africa.
His testimony illustrates African injustice.
Beyond Africa, the pandemic is global.
Today everyone knows these treatments exist.
So the international context is evolving.
New commitment is necessary.
We are convinced of that.
Several initiatives have been launched.
Consideration of access to treatment is not new.
Possibilities will be further discussed with the countries involved.
And this is only the humanitarian tragedy.
Then there is the socio-economic tragedy.
It was about time.
Now perhaps the right answers should be provided.
I think the facts, today, are simple.
The facts are access to treatment and patient care.
Doctors, dispensaries and social support structures are needed.
Money is not enough, however.
We talk a very great deal about Africa.
The time for thinking really is over.
We will meet the challenge together.
.
I just want to thank you for these contributions.
We are aware of the enormous challenge facing us.
Prevention works, but it takes time.
Uganda is a good illustration of this.
You are suggesting that we use it twice.
We are supporting this.
A cure is still far too expensive.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at12 noon.
Creating a monitoring centre for industrial change
Thank you, Madam President.
This report has been endorsed by the Council.
We have already discussed it three times in Parliament.
What is the role of this mechanism?
The Dublin Institute has been mentioned already.
Perhaps you could pop back periodically.
That is not the case at all.
Your resolution is factually incorrect.
But perhaps I am a hopeless optimist.
That was also the conclusion at the Lisbon Summit.
I was really taken aback by this.
Europe and the European economy are doing well.
A new Monitoring Centre is no antidote to this.
The same arguments crop up time and again.
I do hope this time is the last time.
We need to take a more consistent line.
This would be the best way forward.
This is a key point.
There are the national governments and research institutes.
Our aim is a pro-active policy.
For that, two conditions seem indispensable.
She clearly thinks that change is a bad thing.
We must not monitor and prevent it.
And all for what?
But we have not solved the problem.
We have simply postponed it.
I put two questions to colleagues.
First, do we need this observatory at all?
I think not.
I am sure it would.
.
I find that approach interesting.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
Question Time (Council)
We will examine questions to the Council.
You know that we have very little time.
Question No 1 by (H-0626/00):
and
Question No 2 by (H-643/00):
.
Question No 3 by (H-0627/00):
How will it monitor their involvement more effectively?
That is an important priority for the French Presidency.
Council.
Europe must not and cannot interfere in everything.
Question No 4 by (H-0697/00):
They are known to Austria at least.
Question No 5 by (H-0597/00):
To what age is education in these countries compulsory?
There are problems in very many places.
And if so, when?
It is not an easy task.
Question No 6 by (H-0605/00):
What are the scope and substance of the mandate?
It is strictly limited to agriculture.
Question No 7 by (H-0610/00):
The Council awaits Parliament' s opinion with interest.
That is the general rule.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Question No 8 by (H-0614/00):
Question No 9 by (H-0616/00):
This is a crucial issue of democracy.
It does not operate in a vacuum.
Question No 10 by (H-0617/00):
Question No 11 by (H-0619/00):
I should like answers to these questions, minister.
Question No 12 by (H-0622/00):
Yes.
Question No 13 by (H-0624/00):
Question No 14 by (H-0625/00):
Quite the opposite.
So there you are.
That concludes Question to the Council.
Economic and social development of Turkey
There is a Kurdish problem in Turkey.
Is there really a problem here?
Then it is one for Parliament to deal with.
The Kurdish problem has already been mentioned.
You mentioned the Corsican problem.
The death penalty was mentioned.
He is very familiar with the situation in Turkey.
Allow me to give you some facts and figures.
Take a look at Turkey.
It is a law unto itself.
It radiates crisis on every side.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Community audiovisual policy in the digital age
Thirdly, television in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, the airwaves are buzzing.
My group will vote accordingly.
I am not calling for quotas.
But what does this mean?
Perhaps Mr Veltroni could enlighten us.
Remember the Napster and the New Tell cases.
First is the definition of public service.
Not everything needs to be over-regulated by the legislator.
Thirdly, audiovisual policy concerns infrastructure and content.
However, not everything can be regulated by law.
The issue of the digital divide has been raised.
A change has therefore already taken place.
The Commission has clarified its position many times.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Socio-economic background of Erasmus students
There are a number of interesting facts and figures.
I have also tabled a couple of amendments.
I commend it to the House.
That should be no surprise to you, however.
That is why it is worth showing some commitment.
Admittedly, there are problems.
What conclusions can we draw from this?
I will give you an example at random.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Fisheries agreements
Allow me to explain what I mean.
We are concerned here with mixed agreements.
Fisheries is the ideal field for such a combination.
I welcome the agreements that are before the House.
Both agreements have been renewed regularly.
Everybody must do their duty and fulfil their obligations.
We are still waiting for that to happen.
My reason for doing so was simple.
They also seriously damage the indigenous populations.
More stringent checks are being called for.
But that is not enough.
By any standards, this is preposterous.
I am critical of a number of other points.
I believe it is a sound agreement.
There is something to be said for this alone.
The protocol with Guinea-Conakry is a good example.
That is all very well.
Why do these differences exist?
Could you please explain this once and for all.
We cannot overlook the concern about fisheries agreements.
Many thanks for your attention.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Ladies and gentlemen, I bid you goodnight.
(The sitting was closed at 11.25 p.m.)
Annex - formal sitting
(Applause)
Your great experience will prove invaluable in this.
The peace process was launched in Madrid in 1991.
What were our positions?
Otherwise, any solution would be truncated or incomplete.
Our positions have actually been rather flexible.
With patience we shall reach a successful conclusion.
(Loud and sustained applause)
for your compelling speech.
Mr Burg, you have the floor.
Today is better than tomorrow".
Nevertheless the day will come.
Europe for us is democracy.
Europe for us is enlightenment.
Europe for us is parliamentarism.
Europe for us is culture.
Europe for us is responsibility for the environment.
Europe for us is economy.
Look at this man.
He was the architect of the Oslo Agreement.
They say today the sun is rising in Syria.
Thank God we are there.
But it will happen.
The time is never right to do something.
The Middle East has been no exception.
Mine is my religious belief.
Yes, I know it is an oxymoron.
What do I mean?
How can he go home?
I accept your beliefs, please accept mine.
Between us we shall find enough practical solutions.
Let us explore it.
We have a goal.
We are going somewhere.
You raise the issue of refugees.
It is not a unilateral issue.
My mother was a refugee from Hebron.
Israel has a relatively good economy.
(Loud and sustained applause)
This is something we have taken on board.
The time for that has come.
We now know the essence of the issue.
Everyone will do what they think best.
Right to family reunification
I wish to congratulate her on that.
The Commission lumps economically motivated immigration and asylum together.
Thank you for your attention.
There is no harmonised asylum policy.
This is an injustice which needs remedying.
This seems to us perverse.
The Commission has taken this resolution forward.
Immigration is not a problem.
But today we have gone well beyond that.
And why favour just family ties?
A rather singular occurrence.
(Applause from the right)
This is utterly false.
It is up to us to seize this opportunity.
Otherwise we will not succeed.
It is a question of dignity.
I also have siblings and aunts and uncles.
I feel this is unworthy of you.
In other words, there is admissibility.
That is the fact of the matter.
In this way, it would be possible....
It gives free rein to all kinds of interpretations.
I respect the opinions of all Members.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Movement and residence of EU citizens
The transposition of these directives was doubly problematic.
What evidence must be provided?
Harmonising social protection systems and pension systems is vital.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur.
In what circumstances I cannot imagine.
The same would apply to students.
So why does the Right ignore this?
Those rules are far too complicated anyway.
It is not too much to ask.
We support Mrs Boumediene-Thiery ' s report.
Sadly, this is very often not the case.
It is a very good report.
I agree with Mr Tannock in principle.
However, I disagree with his priorities.
Commissioner Vitorino has the floor.
We are currently working on this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Environmental effects of certain programmes
This has been discussed in Amendments 2 and 21.
Amendments 11 and 31 also worry me a little.
This is a major and important issue.
The Council has dealt with this extensively.
This is indefensible in my view.
We also support Amendment No 6.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues
We can go along with this.
Captains will also be obliged to use these facilities.
Thank you very much, Mr Jarzembowski.
But the sea is our primary concern.
This is an important step.
That much is absolutely clear.
This procedure has proven to be worthwhile in practice.
It is a step forward.
But, here we are.
Mr Bouwman quite rightly referred to Erika.
I am among those who welcome this compromise.
In that respect, the agreement is a disappointment.
Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Thank you, Mr Provan.
I am very happy to welcome this delegation.

Explanations of vote- Bouwman report (A5-0213/2000)
Parliament was divided between supporters of two different solutions.
A conciliation procedure had to take place.
This is prejudicing the northern model.
I am satisfied with the compromise we have reached.
This is just a first step.
It recognises the polluter-pays principle.
Let us make no bones about it.
Morillon recommendation (A5-0206/2000)
Madam President, I voted for the recommendation.
The European Parliament must insist on the three amendments:
on protecting cultural identity and abolishing the death penalty;
on contributing to the solution of the Kurdish problem.
That is why I voted for these amendments.
It is time your deeds reflected your words.
SchÃ¶rling report (A5-0196/2000)
Nonetheless, the report does have some shortcomings.
We say no to this.
Valdivielso de CuÃ© report (A5-0204/2000)
This is why I voted for this report.
Europe is going to expand eastwards.
This is written in Agenda 2000.
But that does not constitute a Mediterranean policy.
It should be further developed and deepened.
We cannot be satisfied with such a record.
Varela Suanzes-Carpegna reports (A5-0194 and A5-0188/2000)
Why?
Unfortunately, this amendment was not adopted.
Watson report (A5-0201/2000)
.
It concerns the issue of family reunification.
At national level, situations are extremely disparate.
Those entitled to claim family reunification are:
I am wholeheartedly in favour of family reunification.
But how is the family to be defined?
Nothing could be further from the truth!
This is an unacceptable situation.
You are therefore free to go.
I do not understand the problem.
Thank you for your understanding.

Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
I did not state that.
It was just a possibility, not a statement.
That is important.
It is merely a possibility.
Is that clear?
That was the problem.
Apparently the services understood something else.
But you are entitled to correct your words.
Right now there is no problem.
That is why I cannot say...
We adopt the Minutes.
So if you have a problem ...
We take note of your remarks on the Minutes.
That is all.
(The Minutes were approved)
Telecommunications mergers
.
That is extremely important.
At that time, comparisons were made.
Competition law is an effective tool to this end.
For the good of ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
These cases have increased dramatically in number recently.
Mr Harbour presented the telecom package.
The telecommunications and IT sectors are special.
There is no doubting that this is a challenge!
The reverse is often true.
This is indeed one of our key concerns.
We have to examine situations case by case.
Size can sometimes create problems.
I must be very brief at this stage.
This raises two issues.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
Human cloning
I wish to ask a question regarding the agenda.
Mr Busquin has just made a statement about cloning.
When will the debate on this subject be held?
Comments by Mr Verheugen concerning enlargement
.
But what was the real message?
We want to secure peace and stability throughout Europe.
We have no alternative.
The Commission pursues this strategy with vigour.
The Commission is working on a programme here too.
(Applause)
I simply refuse to accept this.
(Applause)
Turning now to the facts of the matter.
(Heckling)
Please do not get excited.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
(Applause)
You have clarified matters to our satisfaction.
That is the key objective.
That is the message we must drive home.
(Applause)
I therefore especially welcome his statement today.
However the underlying thesis is correct.
I am sure that implication was not intended.
That cannot be substantiated.
(Applause)
Nothing is more important than this.
This is not serious enlargement work.
There is a second problem.
That would be insensitive and unacceptable to my mind.
Then you will have us all on your side.
Well, it is not too late.
I have been asked to withdraw this evaluation.
I am only too pleased to do so.....
I would like to address Mr Cox again.
I did not mean anything else by it......
(Heckling from the Chamber)
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
Human cloning (continuation)
Such formal statements are not necessarily sufficient.
Scientific advances are mind-boggling.
His dream has a name: eugenics.
This dream is in fact a nightmare.
They are people.
It is our duty to respect their dignity.
I do not accept this form of intellectual terrorism.
This is less than two years ago.
As if this would explain and justify everything.
He wants to be the creator.
This is completely wrong.
Mr President, you should listen to the Commissioner!
No one doubts that either.
I suspect not.
And what form has this reaction taken?
Our vote will set this in train.
What is this really about?
Is not every person entitled to health and welfare?
This conflicts with human rights.
These implications are, in themselves, medical.
There are also ethical and philosophical implications.
What status does the embryo have?
Could they not provide new life?
There are economic and social implications.
This debate concerns the whole of society.
There must be an in-depth debate.
You have called for one and we agree.
Safeguards are crucial.
I believe this is the next logical step.
Why does Great Britain behave differently to the continent?
That is certainly an interesting question.
That was the first comment I wanted to make.
It really struck a chord with me.
But I also want my opinion to be respected.
However this is only possible within a lay context.
Claims of infallibility have already done Europe untold damage.
We should endeavour to leave this behind.
No one has a monopoly on ethics.
People who see things differently are ethical too.
Everyone could cite examples of this.
There are certainly boundaries.
We still have time.
Stem cell research would be a less tendentious title.
So let us get some facts straight.
So we come down to the basic dilemma.
The choice is yours, colleagues.
Caring for your neighbour is also a Christian enjoinder.
What does respect for life mean?
Where do the stem cells come from?
Should embryos be cloned?
.
His question concerned the fifth framework-programme.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Question Time (Commission)
We will examine questions to the Commission.First part
Question No 41 by (H-0613/00):
These problems have several causes.
.
Question No 42 by (H-0629/00):
In this case the science was less than adequate.
This exercise brought into some disrepute the precautionary principle.
The Commission made a clear assessment of this issue.
Question No 44 by (H-0688/00):
This discrepancy is even sharper in the Middle East.
A call for proposals will be published soon.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your answer.
Something must be done.
Question No 45 by (H-0689/00):
Second part
I am the Commissioner responsible for animal welfare.
Questions to Mr Vitorino
Question No 46 by (H-0600/00):
I will answer with pleasure.
They are mostly coming into the Union as refugees.
I will consider your suggestions with an open mind.
Question No 47 by (H-0606/00):
I am currently awaiting this report.
What are your views on this?
Question No 48 will be replied to in writing.
Question No 49 by (H-0692/00):
Considerable progress has been achieved so far.
It will function in this form for three years.
The Commission will not drop that idea.
Question No 50 will be replied to in writing.
Questions to Mrs Diamantopoulou
Question No 51 by (H-0647/00):
Harmonisation is deemed to be impossible.
This put forward a two-pronged approach.
We are currently at the debating stage.
Question No 52 by (H-0649/00):
Sometimes there is confusion at national level.
Question No 53 by (H-0675/00):
What is the unemployment rate in Greece at present?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The recommendations make specific reference to this.
The results speak for themselves.
I want to focus on one thing.
So what will change in the 2000-2006 period?
So far, 24 have been established.
Questions to Mr Fischler
Question No 58 by (H-0602/00):
Question No 59 by (H-0609/00):
Question No 61 by (H-0618/00):
It is about securing sustainability in the full sense.
.
You are right in principle.
Question No 62 by (H-0633/00):
The appropriations for said fund were doubled.
It is quite ironic really.
But I am keen to acquaint myself with them.
Commission.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Water policy
In which areas has significant progress been made?
Nonetheless, we shall all have to be vigilant.
The experts' statements confirmed our concerns.
More needs to be done about this.
But the tide of deregulation has turned.
What was disappointing was the water price policy.
I think we can be proud of this.
Mr President, the conciliation has been quite difficult.
That would have been desirable.
This should be provided for by law.
The tasks are therefore broadly defined.
Will we achieve this objective?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
End-of-life vehicles
With me, it never is.
At first glance, that is a brilliant idea.
And that is my overall objection to this Directive.
We see this already where computers are concerned.
I believe it will do so.
It has been a pleasure to work with you.
Two aspects are of particular importance for me.
That is the crucial thing.
This has proved ineffective in practice.
Many thanks, Mr President.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Air transport and the environment
What are the environmental impacts of this growth?
Aviation is massively subsidised.
This does not spell the end of ICAO.
Others do just the same thing.
In fact, clearly the opposite is the case.
That is nonsense.
So I commend this report to you.
Unfortunately this has been built upon by the rapporteur.
National governments must take action now.
It is not subsidised.
Their supporters would love to abolish cheap flights.
But today we are merely tracing an outline.
What conditions must European legislation meet?
We hope that international consultation will bear some fruit.
I would like to highlight a few points.
I believe that this is a factor of importance.
Hence my amendment to provide details of these measures.
We cannot accept this.
The eco-tax will solve nothing.
However, we finally reached a majority agreement.
So let us be realistic, please.
We have to protect our citizens from unnecessary noise.
I would like to highlight a number of points.
We should however urge caution.
We only have two manufacturers.
Air fares would go up.
I mean her original version.
A long journey is a long way to go.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Tyres for motor vehicles and trailers
Vans and lorries produce more noise than ordinary cars.
This seems ample time to me.
Cars inherently cause a large number of environmental problems.
Obviously, we want to maintain standards.
We expect innovation.
This is the road we should be going down.
Now, these tyres are not particularly unsafe.
On the contrary.
However, we must also have room for manoeuvre.
We talk of doing less and doing it better.
Now turning to tyres.
It has consulted with the industry.
Let me speak plainly.
The electors I represent will not thank us.
We are being far too prescriptive.
Mr President, I welcome this proposal.
It is long overdue.
Firstly, tyre standards are not the only problem.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Dangerous substances and preparations (azocolourants)
That is the purpose of Amendment No 3.
The amendments to this report were tabled by myself.
It also addresses an internal market issue.
I believe it is a proportionate measure.
We wish to carry on the dialogue with Parliament.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Undeclared work
What is the heart of the problem?
Workers are in no way insured or otherwise safeguarded.
It is only the path about which we disagree.
Many thanks for your attention.
But it also addresses this problem of undeclared work.
I should like to make one further suggestion.
Let us take Austria and Italy, for example.
Or look at Scandinavia.
Undeclared work must no longer remain a mere peccadillo.
This would-be panacea does not in fact work.
The Thatcher era in Britain taught us that.
This figure should make us think.
This is not true!
What should we do?
That is the heart of the matter.
Failing to declare work is no mere peccadillo.
Jobs cannot be safeguarded in this way.
Nor can new ones be created.
What is to be done?
Moreover, they should expect to receive custodial sentences.
It is extremely damaging both socially and economically.
Acting illegally is anti-social.
We welcome Parliament's support in this.
Changes take time.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Mr President, on a point of order.
Thank you, Mr RÃ¼big.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Sport
The next item is the joint debate on:
the Commission statement on football player transfers;
Sport has permeated the whole of society.
Let us not beat about the bush.
Sport forms a whole.
We need cohesion throughout the Union.
The first question concerns the protection of under-age sportspeople.
Doping is unquestionably a matter of public health.
The credibility of the anti-doping effort depends on it.
We want sport to have a social function.
They too will be making proposals.
Mr President, doping is not a new problem.
Combating intentional or planned doping is much more difficult.
Overall, we need to fight doping globally.
Combating accidental doping is much easier.
Finally, I will mention penalties.
Mrs Reding has already made this point very well.
And the Commission is exercising precisely that remit.
Mr President, sport is a popular activity.
We are dealing with uncontrolled, unsustainable long-term speculation.
Therefore, I think that the Commission should act.
But Hollywood did not go under.
Quite the opposite.
Therefore, keep going, Commissioner.
He would not do anything now to jeopardise that.
Let me turn to the facts now.
There is the training of sportspeople.
But what happens to the individual outside the arena?
They are individuals.
So what happens when the competition is over?
How can the sporting ethic be restored?
The cure is worse than the disease.
We all recognise nowadays that sport is big business.
Other sports have a lot of money sloshing around.
Formula 1 is a good example.
So let us try to operate within our means.
I endorse the Commissioner's remarks this morning.
Europe needs friends, not enemies.
Sport has a huge potential.
Let us work to ensure that sport is violence-free.
You commented on it yourself a moment ago.
NGL).
Why?
Why?
I think we are at a turning point.
I think that is a pity.
I wish it every luck.
I welcome this proposal with open arms.
It confines itself to half measures.
Let me stress that I am saying a part.
Sport comes under the principle of subsidiarity.
Is humanity regressing towards the decadence of ancient Rome?
Exercise is educationally important and vital for health.
Sportswomen and sportsmen are citizens of our countries.
I believe that this is extremely important.
We have heard talk of sporting calendars.
Doping in sport is not simply an ethical problem.
Let us move on to the World Anti-Doping Agency.
The sum of EUR 5 million has been allocated.
The world of sport comes first.
Moreover, we are banking on transparency and dialogue.
The second level is that of the national authorities.
(Applause)
I do not think so.
There is no miracle cure.
I will tell you my personal views.
That is not our aim.
I have listened carefully to your messages today.
(Applause)
Why 2004?
(Applause)
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
This has unfortunately become clear in recent weeks.

We cannot just content ourselves with this debate.
I myself endorse the latter.
This too is a question of ethics.
I am extremely pleased about the decision taken.
Human beings are subjects, not objects.
This smacks of contradiction.

Quite obviously, I think not.
All cloning is by definition reproductive.
At any rate, we hope so.
an immediate and absolute moratorium;
I will therefore abstain on these motions for resolution.
Lucas report (A5-0187/2000)
Then there is the problem of gas emissions.
Aviation and airports have now become a privileged sector.
They are largely exempt from taxes and environmental rules.
We are firm opponents of these proposals.
The Commission proposal is mainly money-driven.
Zabell report (A5-0203/2000)
How can so many countries be persuaded to agree?
.
(NL) Playing sports is good for us.
Doping in sport runs totally counter to that ideal.
Let us restore the true value of sport.
We are abstaining from voting in the final vote.
It is because of the priority given to prevention.
But what has happened to the project?
Mennea report (A5-0208/2000)

Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Nuclear submarine accidents
Their names are no secret.
And that for as long as we can remember.
Why has nothing been done about it?
The answer is simple.
In fact, the reactor was closed down.
And how did the director Jevgeni Adamov fare?
May this serve as a warning to Europe.
Russia is also financially responsible.
They deserve our solidarity.
Facts were suppressed, falsified or hushed up.
But that is not a satisfactory state of affairs.
So we have an enormous responsibility here.
So we must finally put an end to this.
The docks in Gibraltar are type 'Z' .
This is at the heart of our resolution.
It is, in fact, downright impudent.
This is what our resolution is about.
We took two months.
.
I find that quite natural.
The debate is closed.
Burundi
But the accord is not perfect.
A second point is the contentious resumption of aid.
Cease-fire talks are organised for 20 September in Nairobi.
We are organised to step up the actual cooperation.
The debate is closed.
Human rights
Bhutanese refugees in Nepal
Burma
British soldiers held hostage in Sierra Leone
Turkish bombing in the north of Iraq
Bhutanese refugees in Nepal
That is what we are doing here today.
That agreement regrettably is still outstanding.
That is not much.
Is that really impossible?
Is it beyond your powers of imagination?
That is the question I wanted to ask you.
It is high time that substantial agreements were reached.
That has changed.
I hope that will change.
Nepal has already agreed.
There are 6 million Nepalese working in India.
Some movement is discernible.
Burma
That is the situation.
Unfortunately that is not the case.
You are aware of the situation in Pakistan.
All these people are in an unacceptable situation.
The national economy stays afloat thanks to drugs.
And what happens?
The international community looks on and does nothing.
There should be a serious rethink of this policy.
Burma should be excluded.
That should be supported.
The charges against him were trumped up.
We will continue to concern ourselves with that situation.
The EU has acted correctly here.
Brendan Forde
So what can we do?
His name was Ramiro Zapata.
I think that this is a catastrophe for Colombia.
British soldiers held hostage in Sierra Leone
Without peace, development will only be a Utopia.
Turkish bombing in the north of Iraq
Mr President, this is a truly distressing affair.
War will never lead to peace.
This is a bloodbath and a crime against humanity.
The answer is no.
Why is that mothers always have to suffer?
Those guilty of such crimes should be condemned.
That is the fast track into the EU.
They also seem determined to find a solution.
This is completely manageable, given the amounts involved.
It is our responsibility to prevent it.
Several speakers this afternoon have mentioned tourism.
We encourage our citizens to respond accordingly.
They have suffered enough.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 5.30 p.m.
TemelÃ­n nuclear power station
Please just think about Chernobyl.
No.
I cannot vote for this policy.
I hope that we will not disappoint them.
This applies especially to the TemelÃ­n nuclear power station.
I should therefore quickly like to say three things.
But the conditions must be right.
You have to be careful with ultimatums like this.
There are other ways of solving such problems.
That was another point I wanted to make.
But we also have the Euratom Treaty.
The answer is 'yes' .
The joint debate is closed.
Fires in Europe
So what proposals can we make?
So this summer epidemic is curable, Mr President.
We need to be pro-active.
What can the European Union do?
Self-tuition workshops on fighting forest fires are also planned.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
I will gladly do that, Mr Sakellariou
This has never gone through any committee.
I got the message very well, Mr Wynn.
Situation in Fiji following the coup d'Ã©tat
Commissioner Nielson has the floor.
Secondly, a democratic government must be re-established.
The present interim government has no democratic basis.
This process should be finalised very quickly.
The fundamental ethnic antagonism in Fiji must be resolved.
Multiracial cooperation and harmony must become a reality.
This might require international mediation.
We are now at the beginning of the consultations.
Poverty-related projects should, consequently, continue.
Unfortunately, they are for real.
But the Fiji story is more complicated than that.
The army plays a dubious role.
Ethnic tension is once again mounting.
Speight should not be let off the hook.
A three-year transitional period is not acceptable.
Consultations on this matter will be starting in September.
In fact, it is another Chile written small.
I should like clarification from you, Commissioner.
I would like clarity on that point.
The Australian Government wants them banned.
It is not just a donor-recipient relationship.
The options are open.
We have both the stick and the carrot.
But it is an extremely critical situation.
This is also the reply to Mrs Maes.
I can fully concur with everything Mr Ford said.
It is really tragic what is happening.
I am not sure that particular date is meaningful.
The debate is closed.

Tribute
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
European Year of Lifelong Learning (1996)
The Member States keen to participate quadrupled their budgets.
Things have changed radically.
Learning has become broader and longer.
This warning should give us food for thought.
It is therefore a good cause.
Education...
(The President cut the speaker off)
The individual must learn for him or herself.
The rapporteur has justifiably emphasised this.
It is only noughts and ones anyway.
(Laughter)
A year seems a short time for the project.
We can hear that especially from this discussion.
We therefore need new forms of organisation in education.
We need new educational ideas and tools.
But now to the subject in hand.
Very little of substance happened, however.
That is a pity.
They do not mean just vital items of expenditure.
That opportunity must be taken.
Success encourages further ambition.
I feel this is necessary and legitimate.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Thank you, Mr Tajani.
I shall be very happy to do that.
Thank you for that information and clarification.
Of course.
I would ask the Bureau to reconsider this.
Two skinheads have admitted to beating him up.
He had subsequently died from their kicks and punches.
This happened in Kassel.
Thank you.
Order of business
The following amendments to the agenda have been proposed:
The vote will therefore be held tomorrow.
Are there any objections to these various proposals?
Yes, exactly.
(Parliament gave its assent)
I suggest that the two issues be examined concurrently.
I think it is really a question of equity.
Yes, I think that would be best.
The discussion of diversification requires a long-term debate.
However, something has to be done.
The responsibility for action clearly lies with national governments.
Short-term measures will be the hardest.
It is true that compensatory measures are required.
Energy is not cheap.
It is a scarce commodity.
It is now valued at only USD 0.85.
We were promised a strong currency.
There are enough studies to this effect.
Energy supply is more elastic than demand.
A word about monetary policy.
Such prices are unacceptable.
They must translate into action.
Such two-faced behaviour is unsupportable!
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, we have been sleepwalking for decades.
We have two choices.
Let us lower and enforce speed limits.
We must lower our dependency on imported petroleum products.
We do not need a new budget heading.
These heading exist.
Let us put more money in them.
That is all quite true.
That would lead nowhere.
They have a political and economic hold over us.
What chance do we stand against this?
No.
It is high time this was changed.
We need a paradigm shift where transport is concerned.
We need to be less dependent.
We are still lacking such a policy.
So who is guilty of blocking it to date?
You could do that in tandem with the Commission.
Why are gas prices linked to oil prices?
There is no reason why they should be.
You are the obvious person to bring this about.
We can do all of these things.
We can use these opportunities.
(Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski)
This means coordinating the energy policy.
We must be coherent.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Secretariat for joint supervisory data protection bodies
Justice and Home Affairs.
I believe not.
I do not think it can.
That experience is unfortunately very disheartening.
This is completely unacceptable.
That is unreasonable.
The workload is increasing at a ferocious rate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Eurodac
Then the Dublin Convention came into force.
I would be delighted if we could.
Why?
For two quite crucial reasons.
This is particularly important in this case.
Therefore we as a Parliament support this.
This proposal would whittle away Parliament' s rights.
We wholly support the Commission on this.
It is our own freedoms that are at stake.
We are not one hundred percent happy.
On this side of the House we are realistic.
We wish the Commission well in this work.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Unfortunately, 1 000 are fatal.
This can largely be avoided.
This directive will rectify this serious omission.
It uses safety equipment and devices.
Inform us of any situation of risk.
(The President cut the speaker off)
How many accidents are we talking about?
When do they occur?
How do they happen?
What can we do to prevent them?
You cannot have red lights everywhere.
Mr Perez Alvarez has already gone into this.
I am not happy on every count.
Safety measures are not the only things that cost.
This is how productive a moderate social policy is.
We want to Europeanise the economy.
We have the single currency.
Minimum standards mean subsidiarity.
Of course it is.
The EU is seen to be interfering.
They ask: what are you doing for us?
What shall we answer?
This is the issue that we are discussing today.
I say: Let it be now.
This should not be the priority for this House.
They seem to be engaging in a self-fulfilling prophecy.
It is not.
It is described as bureaucratic.
But read the directive itself, read the proposal.
Is it onerous?
Is it burdensome?
You are the people who are causing that.
Stop it now, please.
I welcome your broad support.
It is obvious it is something more than bureaucracy.
Perhaps you can correct him instead of correcting us.
The debate is closed.
Competition rules
Firstly, I welcome this process.
That is what we have on the plus side.
Which market do we mean?
Change was therefore necessary.
These allegations are completely unfounded.
Thirdly, the transitional period should be extended.
Mr Theonas, you raised the question of mergers.
Mr Evans raised the question of trade supplies.
That reform involves the elimination of the notification system.
The debate is closed.
Environmental dimension in the development process
Environmental damage has harmful effects on public health.
This matter has been debated by Parliament twice before.
Allow me to mention three important examples of these.
That is a good thing, in my view.
The path we chose was undoubtedly the right one.
The Commission supports the proposed regulation currently before you.
We are mainstreaming the environment in everything we do.
Sustainable management of forests in developing countries
We started from very different positions.
Parliament has managed to secure adequate funding.
The Commission supports the proposed text before you.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Complementarity on development cooperation policies
We must therefore contribute to correcting this situation.
We demand coherence and coordination.
Conditionality must have its place.
In fact the risk is considerable.
Experience has shown it.
We tried to, but we were unable to.
There are also the Member States and the Council.
We certainly do not share this view.
We need to abolish poverty in the world.
This is more important than complementarity.
The payments, for example, pose a problem.
This is absurd and is something of a disaster.
Theoretical transactions do little to help our case though.
Complementarity and coordination are important pre-requisites for creating synergy.
I therefore welcome Mrs Ferrer' s report.
We agree that we now need to see results.
The Commission has already taken the first step.
We will use this framework in future programming exercises.
I also hope it will produce greater cost effectiveness.
Let me comment on some details of your report.
I agree.
From today the Commission has a clear policy.
It is now up to the Member States.
This is a very good decision.
We, in the Commission, share your concern.
No Commissioner has tried that before.
The support of Parliament is also vital.
I do not think this is the case.
The reform process is now moving.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Trade in goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products
They play an essential role where SMEs are concerned.
Export refunds are not a subsidy.
This is deeply unfair.
The Commission must devise a new system.
The Commission is proposing selective deterioration.
This is a question of temporary solutions only.
Our group supports the committee' s amendments.
But the regulation changes the essence of inward processing.
I shall highlight just three of them.
These objectives are not under threat.
They have my unequivocal support.
I am in complete agreement with Mr Souchet.
Sugar is a case in point.
I am extremely pleased with it.
The second point concerns the budget.
Why?
Surely, this cannot be the argument.
In this sense, an interim regulation is essential.
This relates to the first of the amendments.
This concerns Amendments Nos 3, 11 and 14.
I just wanted to give you advance notice.
The debate is closed.
Enforcement of civil and commercial judgments
I have covered the main aspects.
Let us look at this briefly.
It can lead to lower prices for them.
More work needs to be done in the area.
This will send a bad signal to consumers.
I know that no legislation is perfect.
This cannot be at the expense of consumers.
This problem has been exaggerated totally out of proportion.
They certainly prefer this package to the committee one.
We are consultees.
I believe that Commissioner Vitorino shares his view.
I hope that we will go further.
It has been a long and hard road.
This has been justified very clearly in the report.
There is interaction between regulation and self regulation.
I only do so when there is a reason.
What is to be taken as the domicile address?
I should like finally to strike a biblical note.
We do not need to defer it any longer.
The world has moved on.
Allow me to explain why.
Let me illustrate this with an example.
Contractual freedom is a fundamental principle.
I have certainly learned a great deal from it.
I fundamentally disagree with that.
In the on-line world, we must think differently.
The electronic world knows no national frontiers.
It does not strip consumers of their pre-existing rights.
The scope of this regulation is therefore very broad.
This is the broad legal framework.
It covers both contractual and non-contractual matters.
Quite the contrary.
This is not the Commission' s position.
I am referring here to Article 17.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
(The President cut the speaker off)
We have taken note of your opinion.
Who wants to comment on yesterday' s Minutes?
It was originally scheduled for 7 September.
Yet no alternative arrangements were made for the children.
I cannot believe what is going on!
We will see what we can do.
Terrorism in Spain
We must go further in terms of European cooperation.
Mr Galeote, I hear what you are saying.
We expect him here any minute.
We have heard the Commissioner' s statement.
I hope my message is clear.
They surf the net.
All ideas can be defended through the spoken word.
Nothing is set in stone.
Thank you, Mr Galeote, for your contribution.
No political objective justifies the use of violence.
We have no others.
Where would Commissioner Reding stand as a result?
Without those Greeks, Western culture would be inconceivable.
That is not true.
(Applause)
Hundreds of people have been killed.
Can the European Parliament collaborate with state terrorism?
(Loud protests and heckling)
(Continued protests)
(Protests, pounding on desks)
(Continuing protests)
(Applause)
We must never lose hope.
Parliament needs to facilitate dialogue between the democrats.
Mr President, that honours you greatly.
You are really democratic because you accept free speech.
The debate is closed.
Racism
Our position must be clear, intelligible and specific.
Our position must be intelligible.
Our position must be specific.
Our message must be an ambitious one.
We must be a role model.
The European Union is the product of this development.
We often condemn the perpetrators of such violence.
The only possible response is a hardline attitude.
This was an opportune debate at the appropriate level.
The matter is far too serious for that.
History has borne this out.
How do we mobilise this majority?
That is the question we must ask ourselves.
(Applause from the left)
Which is worse?
This is the road to ruin.
Mr President, Mr Schulz called me a racist.
But hysteria makes for a poor counsellor.
Can I congratulate Baroness Ludford on her report.
I reject that.
I feel that is a very important sign.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Organised crime
Another broken promise.
There are other examples I could mention.
We cannot afford such luxuries in this area.
I understand why it is happening.
This is how it goes.
This does not appear to be happening.
This is a missed opportunity.
Documents are not what we need to fight crime.
Instead we need to tackle crime head-on.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
No problem at all.
We, for our part, certainly are not.
Vote
Yet these are important amendments.
Mr President, on a point of order.
This a very unsatisfactory way of doing business.
(Parliament approved the request)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
On Amendment No 12
Italy has the Red Brigades and Spain has ETA.
(Uproar)
We do not hold a debate during the vote.
You are right to call these political games.
On Amendment No 16
And there is no democracy here!
You are all buffoons!
That is a very interesting point of view.
This is a debate about racism.
(Loud applause)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Wijkman report (A5-0215/2000)
How can we even dissociate development from the environment?
The cure would be worse than the disease.
FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n report (A5-0216/2000)
I agree with him.
Skinner report (A5-0222/2000)
This was also untrue.
It is important that untruths are rapidly rebutted.
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.
This is not one such area.
.
HernÃ¡ndez Mollar report (A5-0225/2000)
Pirker report (A5-0219/2000)
This Convention was signed on 15 June 1990.
I, of course, unreservedly support this position.
Wallis report (A5-0253/2000)
Modernising the Brussels Convention is legally in order.
Glase report (A5-0220/2000)
Sadly, this is the situation.
These measures are to be included in action programmes.
Such sub-contracting effectively promotes the outsourcing of work.
We therefore abstained on this report.
Illicit work must be tackled at the roots.
However, three points are worth noting.
.
Resolution on racism (B5-0766/2000)
I am not sure which is worse.
And why is that?
This resolution is a fine declaration against racism.
Resolution on organised crime (B5-0506/2000)
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 12.30 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statements by the President
President.
President.
Referral back to committee
(Parliament approved the request)
Agenda
Sittings from 15 to 18 January in Strasbourg President.
Thank you, Mr Dell' Alba.
Thank you, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
It clearly is appropriate.
The statement is therefore welcome.
In no way do we oppose it.
Far from it.
Our group has also supported it.
Mr Varela' s request is out of place.
Thank you, Mr Colom i Naval.
I think that everything is perfectly clear now.
Relating to Thursday President.
I can see that this is the case.
I therefore believe that this is a good suggestion.
This is the case for Algeria.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Thank you, Mr SeppÃ¤nen.
I shall certainly take note of your comment.
The agenda is thus adopted.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I have not received any such letter.
I trust that you will pursue this matter.
This is not the first time.
We fly to Strasbourg with Regional Airlines.
Madam President, on a point of order.
That seizure was an illegal act.
Mr Tsiakourmas is now being held in North Cyprus.
They killed people.
They fired on prisoners.
Inside the European Union that is simply not tolerable.
In the meantime, I agree with him.
It is a matter of public record.
Credit institutions
We are thus tabling two types of amendment.
It is vital to do that.
I would congratulate Mrs Peijs on her work.
It is a very good report.
But this is not about apportioning blame.
That has been made crystal clear again here.
That is guaranteed under this proposed directive.
This directive spearheads the action plan for financial services.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Simpler legislation for the internal market (SLIM)
Many are deterred by the administrative red tape involved.
Our rapporteur also referred to this.
But the SLIM process ought to go much further.
The causes are obvious.
It should be anything but that.
I am with him on that one.
I would like to underline this point.
The Commission receives many requests.
I am very grateful to him for that.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Quality evaluation in school education
That is the modern way of communicating.
Parliament will be monitoring the developments closely.
I am interested to hear your reaction.
Do different countries have different patterns?
We are making good progress with this important issue.
We now see that the opposite is true.
What constitutes a good school education these days?
Is it about imparting knowledge and expertise?
There is more to it than that.
The difference is thus quite considerable.
It is essential not to confuse education with training.
It does not necessarily improve the performance of all.
That is why I welcome this report.
I particularly welcome the emphasis on social inclusion.
Networking is so important.
The recommendation relates to two crucial points.
That is actually the goal of a knowledge society.
Thank you very much, Mrs Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
World cultural and natural heritage
There is often need for heritage to be restored.
They have outstanding universal value.
I therefore consider this report to be superfluous.
Nonetheless, the response was overwhelming.
Our historic monument days are always very well attended.
Preserving cultural heritage is important for tourism.
It brings cultural diversity into focus.
It has a bearing on employment.
Nevertheless, there are some good points.
What is the value of these prizes?
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
1997 discharge
A serious start has been made on reforms.
I will give you a few examples.
Parliament is issued with six-monthly reports on this.
The more transparency, the better.
They were clearly set out last year.
I am waiting for more substance, for results.
European aid must serve peace.
A formal condemnation is not doing anyone any good.
, Chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
We are talking conditions, and not just comments.
Commissioner, this is a matter for you.
I was there myself.
Surely this is a reasonable demand?
I would appreciate your support in this.
There were also shortcomings within the Commission.
Who will qualify for the scheme?
It is a voluntary scheme.
You have also mentioned this proposal again today.
Naturally, there is a need for action.
That much is obvious having viewed the matter objectively.
The scenarios can vary a great deal.
So various areas come to mind.
Mrs Theato mentioned the need to reduce outstanding commitments.
There were certainly a great many infuriating delays.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Special reports of the Court of Auditors
, deputising for the rapporteur.
Thirdly, incomplete declarations must be mentioned.
These were the main concerns expressed.
So we look forward to its completion.
That is very important.
What was the criticism about, ladies and gentlemen?
All credit to the Commission for this.
Improvements have been made and staffing levels have increased.
I believe that this is an extremely positive result.
Other criticism was expressed with regard to human rights.
That concludes my comments.
That is the direction we are all pulling in.
But we cannot stand by and uncritically applaud.
Substantial sums go into these developments.
First of all, there is the Garriga report.
Next, there is the McCartin report on agriculture.
Is this having an impact on European aid?
This is not desirable in our eyes.
Could something be done about this?
BSE is only the tip of the iceberg.
We need more transparency and openness.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Firstly, the Commission is receptive to new ideas.
What is ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
His conditions of work were not the best.
I really do not think that this adds up.
That is something I can well understand.
This will require reform of the current CAP.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It has done such outstanding work.
This relationship is indeed complex.
It is not a case of denying responsibility.
Further talks and regulations are called for here.
That is a court case that is ongoing.
It also pointed to a number of IT problems.
The other point was extraordinary bonuses.
We are simply doing our job.
Presumably the figures have been misinterpreted.
That is not the point.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 12 noon.
Financial assistance to SMEs (1999)
I have annexed the detailed timetable to the report.
So that again was not exactly impressive.
However, the Commission did not reply.
We do not understand!"
This is just too much micromanagement.
It is already history.
We are experiencing this with BSE.
It is relevant because of the Lisbon process.
Congratulations to you for supporting that.
That is not the case in this report.
There were no small entrepreneurs in communist states.
Urgent action is called for here.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 12 noon.
Frontier workers
Why?
Court judgments have been passed on this.
That is shocking.
I would therefore call for the broadest support possible.
This is why people decline the office of mayor.
The list goes on.
We must therefore look for creative solutions.
I would like to mention two.
I have included the above in an amendment.
The debate is suspended until 3 p.m.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I hope everybody has heard that.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Mr President, on a point of order.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTE
(The President declared the common position approved)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Relating to Amendment No 1
van der Laan (ELDR), rapporteur.
The text should therefore read as follows:
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Peijs recommendation for second reading (A5-0369/2000)
This is unacceptable.
.
Still students are encountering financial problems while studying abroad.
De Veyrac report (A5-0382/2000)
That is why I voted in favour.
Mr President, I voted against this report.
.
That is unacceptable.
Doorn report (A5-0351/2000)
Thank you Mr Fatuzzo.
van der Laan report (A5-0397/2000)
Thank you for your kind words just now.
I would say that this is a technical problem.
We must be firm on this issue.
.
Garriga Polledo report (A5-0331/2000)
They have links to that organisation.
The report as a whole makes sense.
First of all, this is unclearly formulated.
McCartin report (A5-0396/2000)
This is a principle that we reject.
Staes report (A5-0389/2000)
President.
"But you must, Mr Fatuzzo.
We pensioners need to receive some of them!"
This has been disastrous for farming.
.
Dell'Alba report (A5-0359/2000)
So the Structural Funds should be additional aid?
I disagree.
European funds must not be tied to national funds.
Europe is a separate entity from its constituent nations.
This requires motivated producers.
Heaton Harris report (A5-0395/2000)
The report by Mr Heaton-Harris confuses two issues.
Bushill-Matthews report (A5-0335/2000)
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Frontier workers (continuation)
Only in that way will long-lasting solutions be obtained.
Finally, my comments on tax.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The debate will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Environment directives
What can be done about this?
We can take legal measures to follow up implementation.
The same problem applies to the directive on PCBs.
This can give companies a competitive edge.
In my opinion, there are three fundamental questions.
The problem lies in incorporating and applying this legislation.
We can but hope.
So what solutions do we have?
What can Parliamentarians do?
They name and shame.
They call for fines.
They make proposals for further improvement.
It was poor legislation.
They did not appreciate how far-reaching it really was.
Nor can we see a reversal of this trend.
I would like to comment on two directives today.
These are the habitats directive and the nitrates directive.
What do these two directives have in common?
The same applies to the habitats directive.
The Union is growing ever bigger and more diverse.
An example of sound legislation is the habitats directive.
The habitats directive prescribes a clear goal.
There are instances of incorrect application.
But what do we see happening?
Two camps are forming.
Nature simply will not allow it.
I should therefore be grateful for your support.
We require candidate countries to adopt European legislation.
We are being accused unfairly here.
This is on a local pilgrimage path.
We could do more on that.
What we have to do is modernise legislation.
I agree with that.
We know this from some of the Member States.
We have to draw on that.
We can do more on education and information.
We have started activities like this.
The debate is closed.
Young farmers in the Union
We are living in a computer age.
There is greater emphasis on organic production throughout Europe.
This trend must be reversed.
Young farmers need greater access to production rights.
Many thanks indeed go to him, then.
Social problems are dealt with particularly well.
The average age of European farmers is worryingly high.
Young people must be induced to start farming.
There are not enough young starters, however.
This requirement becomes prohibitive when combined with quotas.
How can we help them?
Young farmers do indeed need urgent attention.
This has been disastrous for farming.
This requires motivated producers.
I think this is a very constructive own-initiative report.
The numbers alone should set our alarm bells ringing.
Young farmers want fair prices for their products.
But apparently bad news makes better news.
We have set standards.
It was the parish plan.
We should not forget that.
All these are things Mr Parish has underlined.
How can you encourage young people onto the land?
Young farmers have computers.
That is the way forward for the future.
Mr President, I welcome this report.
Why should they face an anti-social life?
Measures to promote rural development are particularly important here.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
Question No 25 by (H-0962/00)
But what is the problem, Commissioner?
Urgency is indeed crucial in this matter.
That is urgency is most vital.
Question No 26 by (H-0975/00):
Question No 27 by (H-0969/00):
What will the Commission do to reverse this trend?
Question No 28 by (H-0977/00)
That is point one.
We cannot simply extend the quotas.
Question No 29 by (H-0003/01)
Part II
Questions to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m
Question No 30 by (H-0972/00):
Thank you for your answer.
The answer to that question is yes.
Question No 31 by (H-0973/00):
Question No 32 by (H-1002/00):
I really must thank you for your answer.
Local authorities can never manage on their own.
Where is it to be found?
The plan and the proposal already exist.
We also have to coordinate our emergency teams.
I believe we have made some good progress.
Question No 33 by (H-0001/01):
Mr President, this question concerns the primrose willow.
However the Commission can help in two ways.
That cannot be done.
I wish I could answer that question.
That is the only advice I can give today.
Questions to Mrs de Palacio
Question No 34 by (H-0955/00):
It certainly is not.
Clearly they have not been complied with in full.
Question No 35 by (H-0960/00):
That part of my question has not been answered.
Question No 36 by (H-0963/00):
If so, up to what level?
Questions to Mr Nielson
Let this be quite clear.
I share your concern.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I have two other points.
Will the Commissioner disassociate herself from those comments?
Secondly, waste as such is not renewable energy.
Waste incineration by itself cannot be a renewable energy.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I want an answer to my question.
You passed over my Question 39.
I am here to take the question.
I must request the answer to that question.
I am entitled to that.
There is an order of questions.
Each Commissioner answers for 20 minutes.
Your question is No 39.
Question No 40 by (H-0959/00):
This is normal procedure.
But here I am on clear ground.
Question No 41 by (H-0971/00):
The situation is alarming.
World Mission Germany is carrying out this programme.
I assume you are following developments there very closely.
We are careful to avoid this further problem.
There are a number of conflicts within Indonesia.
They are not all of the same character.
Question No 42 by (H-0981/00):
The Commission is pursuing a twin-track approach.
Question No 43 by (H-0984/00):
That is not so easy.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Common fisheries policy
Thank you very much.
Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n may take the floor.
I think it is entirely appropriate.
Mr Cunha has the floor.
We must understand this.
Thank you, Mr Cunha.
So, Mr Fischler, the floor is yours.
Thank you, Commissioner.
First, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna.
We all knew they would be difficult and lengthy.
This report reviews the years 1996 to 1998.
This, of course, is to be welcomed.
I believe that more progress can still be made.
The Commission must come up with appropriate negotiation proposals.
That is the guiding principle.
Politics involves repeating oneself and contradicting oneself.
We have opted to repeat ourselves.
Why was this the case?
Mr Gallagher addresses this particular point in his report.
But I am not one to blame you.
I should also like to congratulate Mr Cunha.
Things cannot go on like this.
We need more than just a rehashed explanation.
European fishermen are active in very different waters.
I doubt it very much.
Too many fishermen are chasing too few fish.
But regionalisation does not mean some form of renationalisation.
In other countries there are also suggestions.
This can only be good for debate.
This is a truly technological improvement.
Europe should definitely invest in this.
Fisheries needs to stand on their own two feet.
Both reports start from the same premise.
I am delighted that the rapporteur supports our proposal.
Finally, a brief word on the proposed amendments.
We really have done our utmost here.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Bangladesh
The next item is the joint debate on:
Rich in human resources, poor in capital means.
It is regularly afflicted by natural disasters.
There is also instability politically speaking.
The opposition must resume its constructive role.
But the advantage outweighs the disadvantage.
The military presence has not let up.
Europe cannot offer anything but aid.
Absolutely not.
Mothers now have three children instead of seven.
We went there after the UNCTAD conference in Bangkok.
So this is all very good
Many innovations have taken place there.
This is quite remarkable.
Europe has the know-how to prevent the deforestation.
The future of Bangladesh also depends on its youth.
We must encourage them to do so.
Nor do religious wars.
We cannot be satisfied with microcredits.
But we will use IT in all possible applications.
So we should be open to these possibilities.
So we are also looking forward to that partnership.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
This is the question we have to answer.
Our work is indeed inspired by this spirit.
We have remained in constant contact ever since.
I promise you that.
I believe this is a document well worth reading.
So much then, for information.
We must not shy away from it.
(Applause and protests)
That is what we tried to do.
And I should like to remind you...
We must not forget our starting point.
Let us not forget what we have achieved.
That is what the scientific committees are saying.
Thank you for your attention.
(Applause and protests)
You must give a reply here.
Our watchword must be "openness".
What then are the facts?
Depleted uranium is less radioactive than natural uranium.
We did not receive any answer at that time.
I think that is worth pointing out.
NATO drip-fed us with a series of information bulletins.
I think this is necessary.
It is too early to say.
I should like to end with one last comment.
(Applause)
These people include military personnel and many civilians.
(Applause)
You conceded very little.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We have to fight terrible wars against terrible people.
(Applause from the right)
And yet that is what we are doing today.
That is not our subject today.
We have a different subject to discuss.
(Applause)
Did the governments and the military know?
Who will provide them with a convincing answer tomorrow?
Do you take us for fools?
We do not support the call for a moratorium.
I do not think so.
That is what it says in the verbatim report.
Until now that openness has been missing.
I have two observations which are almost personal observations.
I am accepting mine and you must accept yours.
That is not making anybody complicit.
I have nothing else to say.
Thank you very much, Mrs Eriksson.
Mr President, on a point of order.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Rapid reaction facility
So we have an effective veto.
Hence the many amendments proposed by the committee.
They will no doubt explain why that was so.
So far, so good.
For this we are very grateful to them.
Our group will, incidentally, support that amendment.
Where is the European Union not active?
This will widen the scope.
The rapid reaction facility must be flexible by nature.
It is about fast decision-making, acting and funding.
This is a separate issue.
But how, and in what cases?
What kind of procedures will this relationship employ?
What kind of coordination?
He is a friend and colleague.
The lesson of recent years has been very clear.
We are trying to rectify these deficiencies.
Of course I do.
Let me deal with the amendments proposed by Parliament.
We have difficulty with four amendments.
N. Korea
The next item is the following oral questions:
Demands have been made for improvements on these issues.
We similarly have responsibilities in other continents.
Dialogue is the way forward.
The optimism is fading.
I believe we must take his appeal seriously.
Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
I propose adjourning the sitting.
We shall resume at noon for the voting.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- SjÃ¶stedt report (A5-0387/2000)
.
.
Cunha report (A5-0367/2000)
Van den Bos report (A5-0360/2000)
.
Bangladesh is one of the poorest developing countries.
Bangladesh is very dependent on foreign aid.
The EU is its biggest trading partner.
In 1998 we imported 45% of its exports.
Bangladesh has a trade surplus with the EU.
Newton Dunn report (A5-0392/2000)
That too cannot be repeated often enough.
Mr President, what is the Rapid Reaction Mechanism?
.
.
The imperialist nature of this is plain to see.
We do not need this Euro-militarism.
.
.
Oomen-Ruijten report (A5-0338/2000)
"If only they had!"
I replied.
.
That is what we all want.
This is not true either.
Parish report (A5-0357/2000)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
I voted against the report.
But nothing is well with it.
BSE has cast doubt on the entire agricultural system.
.
.
They will focus in particular on young farmers.
We must lend our full support to these objectives.
.
It toys with the existing framework.
These are:
This has to be emphasised in the present debate.
What can the European Union do?
Even Agenda 2000 neglects these fundamentally important aspects.
IT training must be set up.
Varela Suanzes-Carpegna report (A5-0365/2000)
Gallagher report (A5-0333/2000)
This House has rejected that proposal again today.
That is why we supported the Gallagher report.
.
However, I must highlight one particular issue.
Poignant report (A5-0332/2000)
Firstly, resources are finite.
There is wastage.
Joint motion for a resolution on depleted uranium
.
That job belongs to the people.
However, only the future will decide the matter.
.
.
.
Resolution on Korea
That concludes voting time.
He seems not to have a sense of humour.
The issue of refugees must also be raised.
Violations of human rights occur in many countries.
The President-in-Office of the Council mentioned Iran and Chechnya.
To some extent that is inevitable.
That is partly what this speech is about.
I am also pleased that Chechnya has been mentioned.
Turkey does not comply with the Convention Against Torture.
Lord Bethell spoke about Chechnya.
Two new revelations show how serious the situation is.
I could go on and on.
This list is long but it is not comprehensive.
We must act in accordance with our principles.
The victims' families are awaiting our action.
It is crucial that we are consistent and specific.
But we cannot wait until that day finally dawns.
Human rights are not a Western invention.
Human rights are not of secondary importance.
Human rights are universal fundamental rights.
Allow me to comment on a few of them.
Lord Bethell is right.
It was Chechnya and not Russia that I mentioned.
A number of speakers discussed the situation in China.
A few concrete words on some of the remarks.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
Programme of the Swedish Presidency
The Cold War has been replaced by cooperation.
We are too dependent upon one another for that.
The need for cooperation has never been greater.
Full employment is one of our strategic objectives.
I shall begin with the issue of enlargement.
Great progress has been made in the applicant countries.
The Commission must facilitate the process.
Another area to be given priority is employment.
The prospects for the European economy remain good.
Public finances are strong.
Prices are stable.
Nor do we need any new processes.
At the same time, mobility is increasing.
The third important area is the environment.
That is a mistake.
It is precisely the other way around.
The climate negotiations must be resumed.
Environmental issues have a deep moral dimension.
The European Union is not static.
Cooperation has its own dynamic.
Conflicts nonetheless occur constantly in Europe and its vicinity.
I look forward to continued close cooperation.
Europe and Russia need each other.
Important decisions lie before us.
The future of Europe will be created through cooperation.
But E is also for the Euro.
The second E is for employment.
I fully support your undertaking to advance that agenda.
The third E is for Environment.
That is what we are doing today.
This is now 'post-Nice' .
(Applause)
It is necessary for the future of Europe.
This is phase one.
The Union is, in fact, democratic.
(Loud, sustained applause)
.
We must not relapse into intergovernmental cooperation.
We are decidedly against adhering to the old system.
I turn now to the question of transparency.
I hope Maastricht taught you otherwise.
My third and last point is enlargement.
(Applause)
I would like to appeal to the Swedish Presidency.
You therefore have a special responsibility.
This is not acceptable.
We must see an end to this method.
(Applause)
You mention a Conference of Member States.
We have four years to get to work.
Secondly, what method should we adopt?
These days it is available on the Internet.
(Applause)
The next six months will be an exciting period.
The treaties must be simplified.
Sustainable development must become a reality now.
It is now or never.
May I welcome you to the club.
Environmental taxes are an obvious example.
Instead, the decision process became more complicated.
This is an embarrassing mistake which must be rectified.
Such discrimination is not acceptable.
This policy must be reconsidered.
Sweden actively opposed public registers of GM crops.
The EU army will even include Turkish troops.
.
.
The Stockholm Summit will provide an excellent opportunity.
I realise that this is going to be difficult.
The second priority concerns jobs.
The method applied is the open coordination method.
The third priority concerns long-term sustainable development.
Active crisis management is about trying to prevent conflicts.
There is a large majority in favour of this.
Many issues revolve around the three Es.
But what has happened since?
These proposals must be stopped.
Europe is being closed.
Empathy is the key word.
Finally, enlargement.
What would your answer be to that?
I would like to talk briefly about enlargement.
We support this as much as you do.
It must be successful.
The legacy of Nice is not a good legacy.
You will have to deal with it.
It was the same for the euro.
Mergers and restructuring are frequent occurrences.
The Commission applies the current criteria.
Competition should also work in favour of employment.
It certainly saddens me.
I hope that this will be the case.
It is Parliament that has been responsible for enlargement.
This is something of which I am convinced.
It is available.
There are different expressions.
Together, not individually.
Of that I can assure you.
You are all very welcome.
.
Clearly today it has been Sweden's day.
The real reason is as follows.
What happened?
I want to address a second point.
The French Presidency gave us clear information.
That in turn leads to a paradoxical situation.
How are the markets to understand it?
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
We will examine questions to the Council.
Question No 1 by (H-0952/00):
The most popular areas are the poor provinces.
Trafficking in women is also rife within China.
Question No 3 by (H-0956/00):
Instead, an EU citizen will be treated equally.
Question No 4 by (H-0957/00):
.
But it is a purely quantitative measure.
That is certainly not enough for the consumer.
Question No 5 by (H-0965/00):
Question No 6 by (H-0967/00):
However, public Council debates can be held.
Other Council constellations are also holding public debates.
It is quite simply a fundamental demand for democracy.
We can draw parallels with most national parliaments.
Take, for example, the Swedish Parliament.
Even a long march begins with a small step.
Question No 7 by (H-0970/00):
My warm thanks for your reply.
You mentioned the presidential election in Belarus in 2001.
Question No 8 by (H-0974/00):
Question No 9 by (H-0976/00):
I must apply the Rules of Procedure.
My hands are tied in this matter.
I am very sorry.
Subject: Burma
Subject: ASEAN and Burma
Mr President, may I also welcome the Presidency-in-Office.
That is my first question.
Thank you for that very comprehensive answer.
The Council does not give in to pressure.
Question No 13 by (H-0985/00):
I refer to your comments on recovery plans.
Are there any proposals for compensation to fishermen?
That concludes Questions to the Council.
Civil aviation
.
Firstly, in regard to cabin crew.
I am grateful to them for their current efforts.
We will revisit this issue at a later stage.
The other category is workload.
Another factor to be taken into consideration is competition.
But they have not reached agreement.
These issues must be settled.
The Commission and Parliament should jointly see to that.
But first and foremost, flying must be safe.
Perhaps less would be more in this case.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Priorities in road safety
, rapporteur.
We also need European legislation in certain important areas.
But how can that be?
This should be a cause for panic.
Firstly, there is compliance with speed restrictions.
The accident statistics for these areas speak plainly.
The third point has to do with taxation.
My country is a sad example of this.
A year on there is no directive.
What we have in February is a hearing.
More talk.
No action.
No more talk, please.
Let us see some action.
We must tackle that particular problem.
She has issued a recommendation on drink driving.
Member States need and support clear guidance.
It is quite clear that we need action.
I would like to address three particular points.
The signal we send out must be clear.
Either a standard is safe or it is not.
I have a problem with this.
We must now be bold.
It is crucial to have on-the-spot checks.
Talk to your countries.
That is what we recommended to all these countries.
That will give us the greatest road safety.
We already have speed limits on most European roads.
Where do the accidents happen?
That is what road safety needs.
The European Union loses 4 people an hour.
Entire families are being sacrificed on the asphalt alter.
What does this mean?
The same applies to drinking.
There is no getting away from this fact.
Something has to be done about this.
We must seek to make our roads safer.
The analysis of road accidents is decisive.
I see this as a most important aspect.
And here I think road user education is essential.
Subsidiarity is, therefore, particularly applicable here.
But beware, let us make no mistake.
We have not said no to a directive before.
We must make vigorous joint efforts to this end.
The first is drink-driving.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are absolutely right.
The date is purely coincidental.
It was in the communication in March.
I am sorry.
This is not being done for two fundamental reasons.
I do not know.
I am not recommending 0.8 but 0.5.
Then let them implement 0.5 in the United Kingdom.
I cannot accept that criticism.
The problem of control is much more important.
Mr President, my name was mentioned.
Mr President, on a point of order.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Intermodality and intermodal freight transport
Mr President, intermodality is still in its infancy.
We are being forced into it.
The signals are not all set wrong there yet.
We want to give this trend a huge boost.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Charging for the use of transport infrastructure
How can we do this?
.
That is the first issue.
We do not want any forcing up of prices.
We never received that report.
To give just one example: congestion costs.
Is it the end of the world?
No, it is just rush-hour in my region.
Something surely, colleagues, must be done.
That is our challenge.
Secondly, we must promote an exchange of ideas.
There were concerns, for example, about subsidiarity.
I have a problem with this.
All studies have clearly shown this.
Yet this cross-border problem demands a cross-border solution.
This was obvious last September.
Non-UK truck drivers do not pay UK road tax.
That leads to distortion of competition across the EU.
Nobody knows exactly how much is invested.
We cannot ignore that fact.
The time has therefore come to tame the automobile.
I am against cross-subsidies for the same reason.
Yet we must remember one thing.
Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Yesterday' s Minutes have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
She is attending a Bureau meeting of our group.
She was quite definitely there.
She spoke in the debate on the Swedish Presidency.
That will certainly be done, Mr Staes.
(Parliament adopted the Minutes)
The terrorist belongs to the Armata Corsa organisation.
It says nothing about Strasbourg.
In any event, thank you for your information.
He has evidently been accused of spying.
This was a cause for great concern.
Balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process
We need an effective strategy leading to positive measures.
They really do enhance a man' s world.
Some have quota arrangements of one kind or another.
The principle of subsidiarity should come into play here.
It is their job and not one for governments.
The right thing is to keep all mechanisms open.
We clearly have a problem, therefore.
Globalisation and ICT will pull in two different directions.
Wherever it looked it found women were under-represented.
How can discrimination be positive?
This is unacceptable in a democracy.
This leads to the latter being given low priority.
Often, the perpetrators are not prosecuted.
All these women, however, are qualified.
So what can be done?
This is the only comment I wanted to make.
We have to work on this.
It is a much more complex issue.
We might well question how this should be done.
How can we help women?
I have quoted one example.
I am in favour of a quota system.
I am an advocate of the system.
I support the Karamanou report.
Congratulations.
We must change this situation.
That much we all agree upon.
This Chamber does not produce paper by the metre.
This practice has systematically penalised women.
Allow me to start by making a political observation.
Policy without specific quantitative targets and means is simply literature.'
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
Competitiveness of EU forest-based and related industries
Wood is a renewable natural resource.
Science and research must find new uses for wood.
The Hague Convention on World Climate Change failed.
Our committee approved them by general consensus.
Can I sound one note of warning.
Forests create peace.
The report is comprehensive in its present form.
That is what we all want to do.
Without forestry there can be no wood industry.
That is my last point.
Is this also the opinion of the Commission?
This is most justified.
The renewability of peat is an incontestable biological fact.
We have lost 210 staff in all.
We have had to combine departments and offices.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr Swoboda, I agree entirely with you.
What is the point of the European Parliament?
This is the issue being raised again.
I think it is undemocratic to keep raising it.
That is not acceptable.
Mrs Bordes, this is not a procedural motion.
VOTE
United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva
Hedkvist Petersen Report (A5-0381/2000)
'Flying is the safest form of transport there is.
It is on the roads that most accidents happen.
I shall therefore vote in favour of this report.
This is an intolerable situation.
Things are certainly moving in the right direction.
This trend must now be maintained and strengthened.
Shocking statistics show the severity of the problem.
Every person killed is one too many.
Poli Bortone Report (A5-0358/2000)
That is why I voted for this report.
Costa Paolo Report (A5-0345/2000)
What planet do we think we are on?
But what funding must be sought?
Karamanou Report (A5-0373/2000)
This applies also to the field of transport.
I have abstained, and this is why.
Women are demonstrably holding leading positions in our parties.
I voted in favour of the Karamanou report.
Women are universally under-represented where decisions are made.
SeppÃ¤nen Report (A5-0384/2000)
'I do feel very lonely,' he said.
It is particularly important in this context to:
develop forest-based industries within the framework of viable development;
ensure that natural resources are renewable;
That, however, is not justified.
It is therefore necessary to circumscribe market forces.
More sustainable alternatives include gassing and composting.
Mr President, I cannot agree with Mr Deprez.
Read the agenda.
Tactics like this are capable of achieving just that.
We cannot vote on this point now.
You cannot do so now.
Such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately.'
So, not now, but at 5.30 p.m.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Trial of former Khmers Rouges in Cambodia
Cambodia' s parliament has given its consent.
How neutral can those judges be?
What followed was to shock the world.
Amnesties are sometimes necessary if unpalatable.
This concern is well-founded.
No one cared about Cambodia.
The joint debate is closed.
Visa requirements between Russia and Georgia
This invitation is particularly directed at Commissioner Poul Nielson.
Georgia fears that it will become isolated.
So these are truly dramatic events.
We all know what these reprisals are about.
But we are still there.
The immediate reaction was to withdraw from Chechnya.
Let me turn to Georgia.
I say this as a European.
It deserves our support.
The joint debate is closed.
Human rights
Situation in Turkish prisons
(Verts/ALE).
It is up to the government to act.
It is not easy.
The prisons themselves take on symbolic significance.
We should keep this perspective in mind.
I remember the scenes on the BBC.
And what is the upshot of all this bloodshed?
That is our main demand.
A totally different approach must be taken.
The Turkish Government must show the way.
But unfortunately we cannot.
This would certainly defuse the situation in overcrowded prisons.
This is simply unacceptable in a modern democracy.
Why?
Situation in Algeria
So our own message is not compassionate but political.
In this context, one question arises.
This information is obtained mainly from the newspapers.
The massacres in Algeria have not ceased.
People continue to mysteriously disappear.
Torture is still the order of the day.
People still go unpunished.
The violence has got to stop.
For we cannot keep quiet any longer.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
International Criminal Court
It is important for Europe to take the lead.
Mr President, I will be brief.
Thank you, Mr Posselt.
You are as it were our resident lookout.
Nothing escapes you!
Thank you for pointing that out.
(Verts/ALE).
Those objectives have been achieved.
That is the real test for the fifteen.
History teaches us that we must never forget.
Therefore, look back across the last millennium.
Words are not enough.
The time for action is now.
We therefore wonder what lies behind this.
Earlier we spoke about Cambodia.
We are debating the former Yugoslavia.
It needs our support.
This is scandalous.
This is first and foremost this Criminal Court.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at around 6.30 p.m.
Earthquake in El Salvador
To spend so late is to throw money away.
Mr Kinnock' s reform must serve some purpose.
Let us not make fools of ourselves again.
This situation occurring in Central America is nothing new.
We must be more efficient.
The scale of the earthquake was considerable.
This is a convincing example of solidarity.
This is a great joy.
I can only agree with the criticism.
I myself have characterised this as a real scandal.
This is pathetic.
Things are finally starting to happen on the ground.
But this is bad enough.
It left yesterday.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Long-stay visa
Therefore, I assume that you have received it.
This morning nobody protested against this.
I should like very clearly to oppose this postponement.
The procedure has, therefore, been correctly observed.
The vote will take place immediately after the debate.
Therefore, I can take 20 minutes.
This is exactly where the problem lies.
But you cannot treat cancer with aspirin.
Sensible burden-sharing where burdens arise, yes.
Imagine that!
There is no strategic plan for one simple reason.
(Applause)
This is where the difficulty lies.
Mr President, I absolutely agree with Mr Deprez.
I welcome his refinement of the French proposals.
There is a real need for these proposals.
This is a guarantee.
We should welcome it and therefore welcome his report.
I welcome Mr Deprez's report.
The Commission accordingly shares your rapporteur's position.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
VOTE (continuation)
That is why I shall vote in its favour.
Adjournment of the session
That concludes the agenda.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 6.15 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Announcements by the President
Thank you, Mr Dupuis.
(Applause from the centre and left)
I call on Mr Newton Dunn to resign.
Thank you, Mrs Frahm.
I have certainly taken note of your comment.
I would therefore ask you to take action accordingly.
Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam . . .
(The President cut the speaker off)
Economic and social cohesion
I give the floor to Commissioner Barnier.
The second issue is enlargement.
There has been progress.
Disparities continue to exist and are even being exacerbated.
How can we address these issues?
Why?
It is not enough just to send cheques.
The debate is only just beginning.
For whom do we implement cohesion policy?
Other regions within the enlarged Union are affected too.
How are we to carry out this cohesion policy?
I see that figure as a reference point.
I am thinking here of the common agricultural policy.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.
I should like to hear your views on this.
It would not, therefore, be fair.
I see this as a reference point.
That is all I can say for the present.
Thank you, Mrs McCarthy, for your assessment.
The current annual allocation is approximately EUR thirty billion.
Thank you for asking this question, Mr Jarzembowski.
I am here to listen to your views.
Where do you stand on this?
Mrs Schroedter, we do need time.
We are only launching the debate.
All these EU regions have received guarantees until 2006.
This is a truthful report.
My question is quite simple.
That is my first point.
My second point is solidarity.
We must continue to promote solidarity between States.
This is also my view.
(The President cut the speaker off)
You mention changing the criteria, if necessary.
There is a specific paragraph on these regions.
I also consider it important.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes this item.
Mediterranean region
The next item is the joint debate on:
Civil society has demonstrated a clear lack of interest.
Many saw the Marseilles conference as a partial failure.
Furthermore, we believe that culture promotes wealth.
This is what we expect.
They are two real priorities but they are different.
More is requested and then is not used.
The same applies to human rights.
So this report puts foreign policy back into context.
Both reports are disparaging about those other responsibilities.
Enlargement deserves all our attention in the near future.
We need something strong.
What were the objectives of that partnership?
Unfortunately, this is true.
The goal of the Barcelona Process is undisputed.
The association agreements are dead letters in many respects.
Why am I telling you all this?
We need to get a few things straight.
I have a question for the Council.
This imbalance becomes more explosive with every passing day.
This is disappointing management.
I am first Vice-Chairman of the delegation for Malta.
I welcome this debate.
I can only concur with what Mr Martin said.
Mrs Carlotti touched upon the same subject.
It has been an extremely good debate.
Let us not underestimate our contribution.
This was clearly not the right moment.
Our communication is unequivocal on this subject.
We must harmonise measures relating to the single market.
I fully agree with these.
The question is how best to go about it.
I fear that financing micro-projects is not the answer.
I hope Parliament will understand.
That is what we are trying to do.
This is not a virtual policy.
Situation in the Middle East
We shall continue to monitor these issues.
The year 2000 was a year of hope.
Certain significant measures were adopted in relation to Syria.
Progress has been made in all areas.
There has still been no precise decision on this.
I am sure the Commission will also do so.
They will need to adjust their policies.
Let us hope that you are right!
Nor has it yielded any worthwhile result to date.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Sakellariou.
The Union must also assume its political responsibility.
Both sides of this conflict are violating agreements.
We must call them both to task about this.
The journey should have taken 40 minutes.
It had become desert land.
Was there something wrong with the trees?
The Palestinian Legislative Council cannot function properly.
Arafat himself said that his movements are hampered.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is what they fear.
But who fears, exactly?
For heaven's sake!
What sort of Europe is this?
Why is this?
So what is the state of affairs?
That is my first question.
We agree.
Bill Clinton is no longer in office.
I am still reeling from the shock.
The living conditions were dreadful and shocking.
The situation was explosive to an unimaginable degree.
Fortunately no one was injured.
Perhaps they would come to understand better.
People of Europe have no idea of this.
I completely agree with Commissioner Patten.
This is completely unacceptable.
Why do I say this?
Partly in response to Mr Morillon.
We have seen an enormous amount of suffering.
Why do I say this?
This is an historic step forward.
And that was my hope.
I want to make this point absolutely clear.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Plan Colombia
We are all aware of the situation in Columbia.
However, the fight against drugs goes beyond crop-spraying.
What type of programmes are they?
I believe it is important to make this clear.
Many Columbians live in dead-end situations.
The inequality is shocking.
Europe should mainly focus on the outcome.
How is it going to do this?
By providing the Colombian Government with weapons.
Responsibility for what?
Millions of deaths?
Can we accept Plan Colombia?
An effort is clearly called for.
Mr Salafranca says there is confusion.
There is no confusion.
Mr Salafranca condemns abuses by left-wing and right-wing groups.
It just exacerbates the situation.
How many resolutions have we adopted?
That too is our mission.
I always try to refrain from personal criticism.
Please do so.
We have our own plan.
We do not need to relate to Plan Colombia.
What we are doing forms no part of it.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
This is an issue I wish to see clarified.
I would like clear information on this matter.
We are not suggesting that.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Rail transport
Permit me just to look ahead for a moment.
They will be entitled to do so.
So what does this railway package contain?
We could have been bolder.
Secondly, regarding the cost structure.
We have all played our part.
But not so.
Two things are most important.
Far-reaching changes will not be achieved over night.
Here, too, the treatment is unfair.
This investment is necessary.
I say that especially because of the impending enlargement.
That independent authority is important in the agreement.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, congratulations.
That applies to both public transport and freight.
This can be put down to one simple reason.
Research has now provided adequate evidence of this.
This is unacceptable to us.
Unfortunately the same can be said of our train.
We must reverse that trend.
The railways' organisational structure is also at fault.
This will require uniform framework conditions.
However, there could have been other options.
(The President cut the speaker off)
No remedial action was taken.
This is not merely a domestic issue.
The problem is that it does not work.
Let us be clear about this.
Furthermore, the codecision procedure has worked very well.
Concerns have been expressed regarding enlargement.
This kind of thing is always happening.
Trade relations with certain industrialised countries
Other industrialised countries could emulate it.
Permit me to close with a brief remark.
We are extremely grateful to Parliament for that.
Thank you very much, Mr Patten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Energy efficiency labelling
Hence my appeal to you to adopt these amendments.
We are all agreed on this matter.
The information must be easily intelligible to all.
Merely to mention wattage means nothing to many people.
The final decision rests with Parliament of course.
Please take this into account.
That concludes my summary of our position.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Recognition of professional qualifications
There are essentially three reasons.
We want better safeguards!"
Has he undertaken further training?
Has he kept himself abreast of developments?
This brings me to my third reason.
Parliament is keen that we should produce readable texts.
I have already mentioned that I am a lawyer.
We must produce consolidated texts more quickly in future.
Briefly, three more basic principles.
Secondly, lifelong learning.
I believe we have reached a good compromise.
Mr Wieland possesses both qualities in good measure.
We can be slightly proud of that.
I mean the necessity for lifelong learning.
There is something wrong there.
We must put it right quickly.
Thank you for your kind words, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Multidisciplinary Group on Organised Crime
Parliament has advocated this on several occasions too.
I thank Mr Ferri for his work.
But European cooperation is more urgent than ever.
We still have different legal systems, for instance.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
She was a recognised democrat and historian.
(The Minutes were approved)
Decision on urgent procedure
Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
Progress of EU and Member State measures to combat BSE
Important new measures came into effect on 1 January.
A ban on mechanically recovered meat.
Firstly, the one relating to mechanically recovered meat.
Where should the vertebral column be removed.
That is still dogging us.
We would therefore welcome your comments on this.
Then we also take account of the financial aspects.
(Applause)
Mr Byrne intimated as much.
What was done then about removing risk material?
What is the matter with them?
And there is an end to it.
It is a fact of life.
We have moved forward at a snail's pace.
That is fine as long as we move forward.
What else do we need to do?
We need to do the same with animal fats.
That is out of the question.
Fats must be sterilised by pressure cooking.
End of story!
No other method should be allowed now.
We must minimise the risks, that is obvious.
I have heard it all before in recent years.
Exactly which Member State is BSE-free?
And may I ask: how do they know?
Do they look inside the animals' head?
We too want to do likewise.
I welcome and thank you for your monthly reports!
We must no longer blame anyone else.
Under pressure from which lobby?
Has this self-centred policy now been abandoned?
At times we appear to be our own prisoners.
So what are we going to do now?
We were aware of the consequences of this.
We are to burn it.
Milk producers are exceeding their quotas.
Today there are only post mortem examinations.
What has happened to the research into blood tests?
An exceptional situation calls for exceptional measures.
The Commission does not act, it reacts.
What will we do to address distortions of competition?
We are helping the wrong people.
As I said, we bear political responsibility.
We are living through a veritable Europe-wide tragedy.
This is what they rightly expect of us.
Let me give an example.
But just think if we could seize this opportunity.
Mr President, BSE is still a danger.
The danger has not been averted.
Unfortunately it was closed too late.
Is it sterilised enough at 133 degrees?
The second problem is the brain.
We can also use pigs' brains.
The third aspect is testing.
I refer to coordination and control.
My second point concerns alternative solutions.
Other Members have raised the same point.
What are we going to do?
We want more credible answers.
We need to create stockpiles through public intervention.
Firstly, the extent of BSE.
What are the tests showing?
What do the Member States themselves say?
Which Member States have the incineration capacity?
So I welcome the ban.
But is it really necessary?
This position is illogical.
There is no doubt about that.
We need to take action now across Europe.
They must be destroyed.
(Applause from the right)
I can assure you of that.
It merely constitutes a beginning.
The final point is to look for a solution.
That is not the issue.
It is about food safety.
A few speakers have already referred to tests.
What is being done?
They are being clubbed without being tested.
That is just not on.
We shall be dealing with hygiene regulations shortly.
Mr President, I will be very brief.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The Commissioner has the floor.
Why is that the case?
Therefore their confidence rises and they consume beef.
A number of you mentioned the question of testing.
This was discussed in the Council last Monday.
The question is how and where.
References were made to the reform of the CAP.
We cannot do that.
You made very relevant comments on fats also.
It is not just a question of banning them.
Animals have to have fat in their diet.
That is a matter for each individual Member States.
I have said that on a number of occasions.
That undermines consumer confidence.
This is an issue which must also be addressed.
They are found in fat.
It is practically impossible to filter out dioxins.
It is perfect for the calves.
Substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and of beta-agonists
There are six of these.
All the hormones involve certain risks.
Above all, they are carcinogenic.
It is extremely urgent to take this matter further.
Firstly, there is the environmental argument.
It is dangerous to use hormones in this way.
I support the changes that have been made.
Recent studies have shown that oestradiol 17Ã¢ is carcinogenic.
As Mr Olsson said, it is unethical.
The definitive ban on using oestradiol stands to reason.
The substance is carcinogenic.
This opinion was reviewed and confirmed in May 2000.
How can that be justified?
Someone said that this is a political issue.
I emphatically reject that proposition.
It is a scientific issue.
I have been through this before.
This is not acceptable.
Thank you, Mr Olsson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
New frontiers in book production
What then is the report about?
For these reasons they deserve our applause.
This is why this report is excellent.
It is a field which is continually changing.
It therefore covers the whole of Europe.
Commissioner, there is no supply without demand.
A second point is market forces.
These are the good points.
Let us not fool ourselves.
Are you aware of that, ladies and gentlemen?
Let me give you some examples.
This is reflected in our cultural initiatives too.
Thank you, Mrs Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place very shortly.

Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 12.15 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Agenda
This is a bad precedent.
Thank you, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
Relating to Thursday:
President.
Secondly, there is a political reason.
It emerged at the Conference of Presidents including France.
Please have no doubt about that.
I would, therefore, like to clarify matters.
I myself shall raise another issue.
I have some information for Mr Cox.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Unfortunately, the Conference of Presidents rejected this request.
That is completely untrue.
We will give you the information.
Then there is no question of insinuations.
And there is another thing.
That surprised us.
It is a false start.
Thank you very much.
But I am taking the floor about another matter.
Three months have passed since then.
Perhaps you could do something for me.
We shall look into this matter very carefully.
Please join me in welcoming Mr Patakis.
There are 30 people sitting up here.
Mrs Flemming asked to speak right at the beginning.
He was gallant and kind in his congratulations.
Request for waiver of Mr Ribeiro e Castro's immunity
, deputising for the rapporteur.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers
Two main reasons for these accidents are indicated.
This problem is recognised at an international level.
A second point: the captain bears many responsibilities.
The necessary disquiet has arisen over Amendment No 13.
The latter does not have the knowledge for this.
That is not legally possible.
Anyway, work is being done on this.
I hope that reassures those making the submission.
We support the proposal of the Commission.
So we must do something about it.
My group has two observations to make.
It does not involve ships that are sailing.
I think that is a good thing.
I think that is also a good thing.
Safety at sea is a very important issue.
We must invest in it.
It has all been said before.
That means 780 deaths.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Maritime safety and prevention of pollution from ships
This obviously needs to be done.
I was, however, deeply disappointed.
Unfortunately, it seems to be a monthly occurrence.
Last November we approved the Erika I package.
Increased safety is very important for maritime traffic.
Our group supports the main ideas in the report.
Procedures must indeed be simplified.
I truly hope that you do manage it.
Our group will support you.
We are going to make a series of recommendations.
Thank you very much, Mr Patakis.
This will mean an intensification of such shipments.
Once again, my congratulations to Mr Bakopoulos.
There are therefore two distinct areas of operation.
Interoperability of the trans-European rail system
The current situation is extremely complicated.
It was three votes short of being adopted.
The big problem is competition between road and rail.
There was proper consultation.
Part three is still to come.
I already brought this matter up last time.
A specified language must be spoken.
Which language are we going to speak?
English, as in international shipping or aviation?
That will make all communication very easy.
I congratulate the rapporteur on that outcome.
International railway regulations are becoming increasingly hard to obtain.
Not any longer.
That is a miracle which is still realisable.
That is positive.
It is the construction of a European railway.
And that is exactly what this measure does.
That will take somewhat longer.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Recovery of cod stocks in the Irish Sea
It is very short.
He was working under great time pressure.
When will we learn that lesson?
I particularly have in mind the chaotic BSE situation.
There is still a great deal to do.
It is an example to other areas as well.
A similar situation has arisen in the North Sea.
I thank the rapporteur in his absence.
The CFP review provides a challenge and an opportunity.
That is how exhausted the sea is.
That just leaves the Commission.
This is not an easy problem.
It is a very serious problem.
This is what I want to concentrate on.
The system of MAGPs has also been a disaster.
A problem exists.
This is an old story.
It is trying to solve a difficult problem.
Unfortunately, I have to reject this amendment.
Why?
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
And thank you for being so brief.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 8.30 p.m.)
Thank you, Mr President.
Vote on a request for urgent procedure
(Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure)
Commission work programme for 2001/Nice
I will not dwell on the last 12 months.
These are not a random collection of disparate items.
Secondly, the disappointing outcome of the Nice Conference.
This debate can be postponed no longer.
So what public debate are we talking about?
We must get to the heart of the issues.
It will not take up positions on constitutional questions.
(Loud, sustained applause)
It is absolutely unacceptable.
But it shows where the shortcomings lie.
We need people in government dealing solely with Europe.
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
We should like to be more specific.
My second comment concerns asylum and immigration policy.
Only a common policy can resolve these difficult issues.
My third comment concerns Europe as a financial centre.
We shall support you in strengthening the Community institutions.
If we work together, it will succeed.
(Applause)
We also need a long-term approach to the East.
President Prodi called for environmentally sustainable development.
These are the key aspects of the programme.
This is what we need.
We are all in this together.
But I have looked at it.
It is 49 pages of high-density non-communication.
It is 49 pages covering 593 different initiatives.
We have to move away from this.
We do not find the answers in here.
I would like to see them.
Is it yours?
(Applause)
Population growth was mentioned here.
In this we all have a great public responsibility.
I will take one very topical example of this.
No, civil society is very much a reality.
What conclusions do you draw from such assessments?
Why not?
It is not a done deal.
That is not how political persuasion operates.
We put forward proposals.
In short, Nice means less democracy.
That would only force us into new deadlocks.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission.
Fine words, Mr President, but too vague.
Parliament does have its weaknesses, it is true.
I would rather refer to democratic governance.
It must also be broadened.
Democracy also includes dialogue with civil society.
I admit that one hundred per cent.
(Applause)
No, Mr President.
I take a different view.
That too is a slippery slope.
The Commission submits proposals.
It has the right of initiative.
I admit that.
(Applause)
Nice showed the failures of intergovernmental Europe.
On the contrary, Nice was a renationalisation-fest.
That is by definition what parliaments are for.
This should not be kept under wraps.
That brings me to the third point.
My third point relates to the subjects.
Post-Nice is not what it is about.
That is the way it should be.
The promise is binding.
But how is that to be arranged?
When are they to obtain one?
But how?
Europe requires a different strategy, a different idea.
Their failure in Nice is quite enough.
What is required is more centralism and less democracy.
Of course the people of Europe will resist.
The path that has been prepared cannot succeed.
Its opponents do not reject the name.
They reject the convention itself.
The Union does not need a diminished Commission.
This is something we are impatiently awaiting.
I would thank the Commission for its determined efforts.
Now comes the difficult part, however.
We too have to adapt.
Now is the time to do something about it.
It is the spirit of intergovernmentalism.
The issue of national parliaments has been addressed.
That is their job.
They cannot restrict the role of the European Parliament.
But we need a common concept.
I would plead for a special procedure.
I would advocate that way forward.
The cooperation process is dynamic not static.
It is not true.
Our view on the core issues is clear.
The next consultation must be different.
Mr Corbett quoted Chairman Mao.
The EU must sustain a truly open society.
We must also reschedule the next IGC.
There are important questions.
(Laughter and applause)
Targets were set and extra staff were made available.
This will have to be rectified.
We believe in reform and democratisation of the WTO.
The European research area is of course important.
Ferber (PPE-DE).
President.
A German reference would read: tries hard.
What exactly is good governance?
Is it transparency?
Fine, Mr Prodi.
Not in my book.
And what about cutting red tape, Mr Prodi.
Are they any faster?
And who controls them?
Who imposes sanctions when they do not function?
Is that more democracy, I ask you?
Last year there were 500.
Thank you.
Mr HÃ¤nsch even talked of producing a single document.
I am speaking now only of the model.
But we must go further than that previous model.
This is the essence and the strength of Europe.
I would like to make one more observation.
An interesting example has been given.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Industrial restructuring and mergers
The time for that has now come.
Commissioners, we impatiently await your responses.
Our idea consists in making these auditions more systematic.
I am delighted with the Commissioner' s response.
That is quite logical.
Volkswagen in Germany is a good case in point.
We want to see that true partnership.
We have done that.
It would be helpful.
But we will withdraw our resolution.
We must make sure they are effective.
Any merger contract must include social clauses.
We shall now proceed to the vote.

Nicholson report (A5-0042/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
And here's to the cod as well!
That concludes voting time.
Industrial restructuring and mergers (continuation)
Mr President, globalisation reduces economic distances.
Who is it that ultimately pays for social restructuring?
Prevention and fair, balanced change are impossible.
Parliament can no longer tolerate such behaviour.
This sort of news is commonplace now.
I will cite two examples.
Another example can be found in competition policy.
The first is forecasting.
The second is the legislative and institutional framework.
The third strand is specific policy.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Copyright and related rights in the Information Society
So I am in favour of restricting private usage.
Harmonising cultural traditions is no easy task.
There is talk of a balanced common position.
A balance between whom?
Between rightholders and the public interest.
Copyright law must serve the rightholder.
His position must be strengthened for future contract negotiations.
This too is a possibility which we should debate.
That is the question we should ask ourselves.
You must admit that it is surprising.
That is what will happen to the markets.
No one pretends that it is perfect.
It is important to emphasise that.
This is an enabling, liberating directive.
We have got that balance right.
That is a very important provision.
We have strengthened the review provisions.
But it is not.
With the consent of the European Parliament.
After 18 months of deliberation in the Council.
The common position has dramatically undermined authors' rights.
Is it not all a bit too soon?
Where is the right balance to be found?
This is no easy task.
Let us not be naive, Mr President.
Hence the need for copyright and performers' rights.
Why am I defending this opinion?
First and foremost for reasons of principle.
Is there anything more important than protecting private property?
But there is more to this debate than principles.
Copying will also cost jobs.
The State loses out on income too.
Copyright is not absolute.
Exceptions are required.
This means something.
They also employ 1.4 million people.
We must not encourage people to infringe copyright.
The lobby has already been mentioned.
That is a directive for a citizens' Europe.
They are getting something for nothing.
I say this sincerely.
To try to harmonise them is an heroic quest.
I refer to what has already been said.
Firstly, Amendment No 2.
Deliberate release of GMOs into the environment
We have the precautionary principle reaffirmed.
We have tighter risk assessment of all GMO releases.
We have a clear timetable.
I welcome this.
I therefore commend this important legislation to the House.
We have brokered a good compromise.
Potential environmental dangers must be closely monitored.
We expressly welcome all this.
(The president cut the speaker off)
We want to retain the moratorium on commercial cultivation.
Clear boundaries are essential in this respect.
The Council should approve the Cartagena Protocol without delay.
We largely have Mr Bowe to thank for this.
The rapporteur has done a fantastic job.
Instead, we must make use of science.
The debate is suspended.
Reform of the beef and veal market
I give the floor to Commissioner Fischler.
What exactly is this plan?
Fast action is called for.
Storing meat is clearly not enough per se.
We therefore also need fast reform.
Allow me now to outline these seven points briefly.
We have no alternative.
And yet none of this is enough.
Thank you for your attention.
Could you comment on that too?
These measures are a step in the right direction.
But this package sends out the right signal.
As I, in fact, said.
I think you are quite right.
This system defies belief!
(The President cut the speaker off)
My second question relates to calves.
That is also a fact of life.
Then there is also national certification.
In other words, these certifications must be notified.
Then there is also private certification.
The systems vary from country to country in Europe.
What is the Commission' s view on this?
This system has worked perfectly so far.
That is news to me.
The slaughter premiums are the same everywhere.
There has been a great deal of criticism here.
That is the ratio.
It makes the position clear.
I am very grateful for that.
That creates a very acceptable basis for debate.
I have a question concerning the stocking density.
Now for my second question.
How are you planning to resolve this?
So it is important to remove the older animals.
This investigation is under way.
Why?
That concludes the debate.
Question Time (Commission)
We will examine questions to the Commission.
Thank you very much, Mr Berenguer.
Part I
Question No 45 by (H-0014/01):
I thank the Commissioner for his reply.
Question No 46 by (H-0055/01):
What preventative measures does it intend to take?
Have I understood correctly?
Is that what you meant?
What can I say?
And there you have it.
Question No 47 by (H-0037/01):
The people are getting rather desperate.
There have been hunger strikes.
The people now want to see real progress.
Question No 48 by (H-0069/01):
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Your reply was most satisfactory.
I congratulate the Commissioner on his reply.
However, he talks about EU values and standards.
Question No 49 by (H-0085/01):
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Kinnock
The Commission is actively supporting this through different initiatives.
I would thank the Commissioner for his answer.
I have a number of questions.
Issues such as this are always kept under review.
Question No 50 by (H-0057/01):
Question No 51 by (H-0081/01):
Public openness is a major factor in that process.
Question No 52 by (H-0122/01):
That was the sole purpose of the letter.
I am sure that will continue.
Well, that really takes the biscuit!
Thank you for your answer.
What I said was not ridiculous.
It is not in any way a secret.
That will take place in due course.
Question No 53 by (H-0083/01):
The selection board consisted of 8 men.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I believe we will reach the targets by 2005.
They are not over-ambitious targets.
They are however realistic given our starting point.
It is not in fact a selection board.
It is an advisory committee on appointments.
I hope that this support and understanding will continue.
Questions to Commissioner Byrne
Question No 54 by (H-0011/01):
What monitoring facilities have been set up?
How many animals have accumulated in the individual countries?
Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
Question No 55 by (H-0019/01):
At least in Germany ministers have resigned.
These are obviously very powerful measures.
What guarantees are being offered to consumers?
And what is the reason for them?
Where is the harmonisation?
Accordingly, the waivers were granted in those circumstances.
It is a Community-wide measure.
It applies to all Member States.
This was a justifiable response.
Question No 56 by (H-0021/01):
Is their sale outlawed in any Member State?
And this teacher is you, Commissioner.
Do you agree with this?
Is this not a contradiction?
Answer me please.
Some Member States do that.
That other measure can be allowed in those circumstances.
The problem is then of exactly defining the criteria.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Deliberate release of GMOs into the environment
What is the conclusion?
The conclusion is that rules and monitoring are necessary.
We are to obtain more stringent risk assessment requirements.
We must not make the same mistake twice.
Parliament' s third task is to take responsibility.
Moreover, remember BSE.
There is other legislation under way.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Community Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)
, rapporteur.
The first is its use as a market tool.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Food supplements
Does anyone wish to speak for the motion?
(Parliament rejected the motion)
I particularly wish to highlight the area of application.
This applies firstly to permitted minerals and their compounds.
The Commission proposal clearly covers this.
I totally support this.
Many thanks, Mrs Corbey.
This means harmonisation, harmonisation for the consumer.
The market for food supplements is developing apace.
We must therefore separate the wheat from the chaff.
Firstly, the scope of the directive.
That is the basis for consumer confidence.
Lastly, a few words about labelling.
Once again, my sincere thanks to the rapporteur.
We welcome this contribution.
Claim and counter-claim, then.
Our belief is that the two systems can coexist.
Folic acid is an example.
That will help many consumers and worry none.
The Commission should not be attempting to make it.
We would be better off without it.
I appeal to you to get the balance right.
It is most important.
Harmonisation is therefore necessary.
Commissioner, this is not harmonisation.
I accept this principle.
Amendment No 7 concerns the definition of dose form.
This is a highly technical matter.
This is also our aim.
Therefore I would not accept Amendment No 8.
This is not a subject for legislation.
Therefore, I cannot accept Amendment No 11.
Therefore, I cannot accept Amendment No 13.
This would create confusion for consumers.
I can accept Amendment No 19.
Therefore I cannot accept Amendment No 21.
Therefore, I cannot accept Amendment No 22.
This happens often in the food area.
I cannot accept Amendment No 23.
For this reason I cannot accept Amendment No 24.
I cannot accept Amendments Nos 26 and 27.
It does not include other ingredients.
Finally, I come to Amendment No 43.
Therefore I cannot accept Amendment No 43.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Two or three-wheel motor vehicles
I do not agree with that.
Motorcycles constitute a very small percentage of traffic volume.
I therefore welcome this proposal but with certain reservations.
Lastly, on the subject of fiscal measures.
Subsidiarity is something that should be protected.
Finally, I have a question for the Commission.
These values really look quite respectable.
The Commission acknowledges the need for this second stage.
The work programme is progressing according to schedule.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Vehicles with more than eight seats
Maybe I should declare an interest at this point.
Just before Christmas my mother unexpectedly lost her sight.
It will tie up the industry in red tape.
So I will not go through the amendments.
He has done a good job on that.
The same arguments apply.
Regrettably that is not the case.
If it were, we would support it.
What have we actually achieved after nine years?
I had a look through these 150 pages.
It does not address school buses.
There are going to be new provisions for superstructures.
When is all this going to end?
Not a single word of explanation.
Do they do so on grounds of cost?
No.
Do they do so because of objections from manufacturers?
No.
No.
They are wrong.
We must and we will.
The rapporteur then was Mr Murphy.
We are fully in agreement with that.
So why are we rejecting this directive?
This is extremely important and needs to be guaranteed.
Thirdly, we want the principle of mutual recognition.
We wish to see mutual recognition.
The report is about more than just buses.
Why should Parliament change its mind now?
We have come a long way since then.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Community incentive measures in employment
The process is open.
Is the process too informal, then?
This could be a pilot project.
The Commission has also applied its funding very carefully.
Expenditure was only 50% of commitments.
The potential is certainly there.
Back to the report, however.
These amendments relate to five different points.
In fact, it could not be otherwise.
This is a very good report.
I refer to just two aspects.
I strongly support women's rights.
I agree with that.
It should be gender-specific to the maximum possible extent.
I believe it was fine as it was.
The second point concerns the budget.
Last year's budget was EUR 50 million.
They are 51% of the population.
Women comprise many groups.
This is why women have their own committee.
Amendment No 4 also concerns equal opportunities.
So I regret that I cannot accept this amendment.
So, I cannot accept Amendment No 14.
I therefore cannot accept Amendments Nos 16 and 17.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12.20 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Yesterday' s Minutes have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
It is our responsibility to use them.
I have never once called for parliamentary immunity.
I intended to vote yes on the RÃ¼big Report.
We will look into this matter.
(The Minutes were approved)
Thank you, Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez.
Accession partnership with Turkey
Turkey will then have to act.
Turkey is neither privileged nor disadvantaged.
And indeed, we should not deny this.
It is a difficult issue.
Let me conclude with two further brief comments.
This distinction has been drawn on sensible political grounds.
What exactly is the situation?
We are neglecting this at the moment.
We must bring these matters to a sound conclusion.
I could not agree more.
This difference provokes certain general comments.
Obviously that will not suffice.
Here Turkey's conduct shows a regressive trend.
The door remained closed.
The regulation is a confidence-building measure.
The regulation will trigger a raft of reforms.
The question now is does this strategy work?
I think they would enhance the regulation.
Which side will score?
I would claim that the reality is very different.
In fact, the opposite is true.
We do not think so.
Is this the case?
Obviously, we cannot ignore this fact.
Ongoing tensions bear this out.
Secondly, Article 4 of the Commission proposal.
Let us look forward rather than constantly harking back.
I think this is our problem.
The ELDR Group wholeheartedly supports this fundamental message.
We repudiate that kind of intolerance.
We do not need to go any further.
This must be stopped right now.
For these statements he risks several years of imprisonment.
The regulation under discussion concerns pre-accession aid to Turkey.
This position is wrong for three reasons.
This distinguishes it from the other candidate countries.
The second reason is because we should not discriminate.
Mr President, I have a dream.
This would have two consequences.
Both are highly unlikely scenarios.
And of course this does not apply to Turkey.
I say this without any ifs and buts.
Accession will only take place on our terms.
Commission.
Unfortunately, nothing has changed in that regard.
This brings me to my second point.
It simply has not.
The Accession Partnership sets out our expectations of Turkey.
Turkey is an important country.
Turkey is of particular strategic importance.
That can and must not happen.
The Commission would like this to happen too.
Nor are there any budgetary reserves.
A Member of this House asked this question.
They have all been paid out.
Only SAPARD was paid out rather late.
But we do not have any budgetary reserves there.
This must be discussed with the Council.
I would like to say one last thing.
The Council is monitoring this matter extremely carefully.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Lisbon
The next item is the joint debate on:
They must not be played off against each other.
The Stockholm Summit comes precisely at this decisive moment.
Of course they are.
And Mr Bullmann has stressed this point too.
In other cases things are moving too slowly.
All these objectives are highly demanding.
I believe there are basically three of these factors.
Lastly, education.
The outlook for the European economy is still good.
Public finances are strong.
Prices are stable.
Nor do we need any new processes.
Let me name a few.
Expected demographic development in Europe poses a growing challenge.
This is in the interests of us all.
The resource Europe has is knowledge.
We talk about new technologies such as the Internet.
The Internet has been mentioned.
I am fundamentally opposed to this demarcation.
I think he simply belongs to the economy.
We need to make our structures competitive.
An example is water.
Water is a limited resource.
But we must not abandon political responsibility.
It is a difficult balancing act.
We now need firm proposals.
Biotechnology must also be stimulated.
Do not forget that.
It is what is called constructive criticism.
My first point concerns the content of the report.
Parliament is currently considering this issue.
The Commission should look into two issues more closely.
These are a few suggestions, Commissioner.
However, it still contains many areas of bias.
Why is Ireland being criticised?
They have absolutely no idea what they entail.
The business community is already complaining of fact-finding overload.
They provide a snapshot of reality.
.
Now, that is nonsense.
We must take this problem into consideration.
We need more global rules for global competition.
But it must be consolidated and implemented.
But a soft landing does seem possible.
I hope they are as good as their word.
They are ready to renationalize.
California is turning dramatically left.
No, clearly not.
I did not hear that mentioned recently.
.
We are on the right path.
I found what Mr Prodi said yesterday very encouraging.
Or are the responsibilities different?
Where do I think these priorities lie?
.
Perhaps you could work yet another miracle.
Thank you, Mr Rack.

Bowe report (A5-0032/2001)
That is what today' s vote means.
Why?
.
.
I have therefore abstained in the vote.
However, there are still some disturbing grey areas.
We therefore voted against this report.
What provisions will they lay down?
This then really is a fool' s bargain.
.
Hence I will vote against the proposal.
.
GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen Tormo report (A5-0033/2001)
The eco-management and audit scheme will be an incentive.
Who is responsible for assessing how environmentally-friendly companies are?
Obviously he finds them interesting and worth exhibiting.
I hope so.
.
.
.
I declare an interest in the matter of copyright.
I am not a paid lobbyist.

Why was there was so much lobbying?
.
It has taken nine years to get this far.
This is really important.
We in the PPE-DE Group still take this line.
.
We should leave things where they belong.
.
It has taken nine years to get this legislation.
.
This is something we welcome.
This approach jeopardised the rights of the disabled.

MÃ¼ller report (A5-0025/2001)
So I think certain substances should be controlled.
Substances are added to foods to make them aphrodisiac.
Substances like Viagra are on sale.
.
But quality not quantity matters.
Food supplements should be ruthlessly declared and officially monitored.
Europe must not shirk its responsibility.
Obviously, they should not present a health risk.
Lange report (A5-0015/2001)
Pensioners appreciate silence, bicycles and quiet motorcycles.
Jensen report (A5-0018/2001)
.
Jobs, jobs, jobs.
That is what it is all about.
We therefore voted against this report.
More specifically, the following actions will be covered:
2) Assessment of national action plans;
I therefore abstained.
Swoboda Report (A5-0024/2001)
Madam President, we remain concerned about Turkey.
.
It should also monitor fair distribution of the money.
.
Action taken on EIB annual report
Europe is expanding eastwards.
Both functions must be fulfilled.
That is why we support this report wholeheartedly.
So the fault does not lie with you.
I will talk about employment first.
I have a final comment to make.
Two thirds of its disbursements go towards this.
Why?
First, sharing out resources more efficiently.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Lisbon (continuation)
I would like to make two points.
How do we measure this success?
We also have the external value of the euro.
That would help our debate a great deal.
Why are we in Parliament no longer trusted?
What are you afraid of?
One of 10 years will soon have passed.
A good economy is a prerequisite for welfare.
Cohesion must not be restricted to the Structural Funds.
Of course there are.
But why is this not highlighted?
My second point concerns social protection.
This has now been done.
Indeed, we should end up drafting guidelines.
My final point pertains to employment.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
No economic policy without this objective is possible.
Was that just an idle boast?
Few have taken up this aspect.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work.
But paper is patient.
We do not need a literature Summit.
I shall try to make a few comments.
Would it not be appropriate to mention both subjects?
We certainly included some specific references to structural reforms.
Free movement of persons
That is what is at issue.
So, do not shake your head!
It certainly does not seek to harmonise them.
There are three aspects to today's debate.
I do not need a plea for this.
None whatsoever.
The same is true for unemployment and medical expenses.
That is a big problem.
We know.
We all do.
Mrs Lambert said that discrimination must be prevented.
Do not ask me why.
Something must be done about this.
This is to be welcomed.
It is vital that mobility is established.
Certainly if this period is reduced to twelve months.
But there is a time and place for everything.
It is about lack of recognition of qualifications.
Just ask journalists in Brussels, for example.
Examples of this are legion.
Who are the architects of this system?
This is also evident from the replies.
We now have another right: that of codecision.
I believe that that is not right.
This is today' s topic of discussion.
I do hope so.
You are all too aware of this.
Quite the reverse in fact.
This is not why we pursue this strategy.
Similar action is being taken in other countries.
We believe this is extremely important.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
First Mr Alavanos has a point of order.
Similarly, question no.
Question No 1 by (H-0015/01):
Question No 2 by (H-0022/01):
Mr Danielsson said nothing about this.
But what about the mandate?
Is a mandate needed?
We must have a clear answer to this.
That is my question.
I believe we can sleep soundly in our beds.
It is not about the general principles.
It is not about spirit or other higher values.
Or yes, such a mandate must be obtained.
I think that should count for a great deal.
They always maintain that it is not.
And that is a scandal.
There is major support for this view.
Question No 3 by (H-0031/01):
Yes or no?
It is very easy to answer yes or no.
Let me therefore try to summarise it as follows:
No now.
Yes possibly later.
Question No 4 by (H-0018/01):
Mr SjÃ¶stedt must accept responsibility for his statement.
I cannot verify it.
Question No 5 by (H-0023/01):
I will be brief.
I would remind you of previous action taken.
This is unacceptable in my opinion.
We are currently awaiting such proposals.
Question No 6 by (H-0026/01):
Mr Bonde asks an important question.
However, Mr Schmidt need not worry.
Question No 7 by (H-0027/01):
This is an important issue under the Swedish Presidency.
We are working actively on this issue.
I was the rapporteur for that plan.
Mr Nogueira has the floor.
You are both protected by your legitimate rights.
There will not be a debate on this.
Question No 8 by (H-0032/01):
Question No 9 by (H-0052/01):
The majority of this aid benefits women.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Question No 10 by (H-0040/01):
Question No 11 by (H-0041/01):
Question No 12 by (H-0042/01):
Question No 13 by (H-0043/01):
Question No 14 by (H-0044/01):
Question No 15 by (H-0045/01):
Question No 16 by (H-0046/01):
The honourable Member raises a very relevant question.
Will we see a draft before Gothenburg.
Mr President-in-Office, thank you for your reply.
What concrete measures does the presidency propose?
You have also referred at length to energy.
Energy efficiency is an important priority.
The honourable Member has put three very extensive questions.
Question No 17 by (H-0050/01):
The export subsidies make the very worst transportation profitable.
Above all, improvements are required.
Question No 18 by (H-0054/01):
What preventive measures does it intend to take?
.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
Reorganisation and winding-up of insurance undertakings
The second reading is now formally before Parliament.
This is the universality principle.
The directive must ensure that creditors are treated equally.
The Council has allowed eleven years to elapse.
I fully share their opinion.
So the system works.
The debate is closed.
The Union and Macao beyond 2000
Relations are still very close between Portugal and Macau.
This clearly warrants our criticism.
.
I can report that EU-Macao relations remain extremely good.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I will outline some of these in a moment.
Indeed the liberalisation covers very nearly all sectors.
So its terms and scope are very far-reaching.
It must include effective monitoring of human rights.
We shall obviously be voting in favour.
Actually that sensitivity is not confined to this Parliament.
Mexico is an important country.
It is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world.
Accordingly, this agreement is of great political importance.
Implementing the Mexico agreement therefore serves a pilot function.
This, I believe, is a truism.
What is more, this works in both directions.
I will follow it closely.
.
I have two specific points to make.
Rather, investments must contribute to enhancing regional development.
This is quite significant.
It entered into force on 1 July 2000.
But this decision has also a bigger impact.
It is a new, very ambitious beginning.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence
Unfortunately, they are still dying.
That is why a correction was crucial.
We are not yet ready.
We do not yet have that policy in place.
We support the French initiative.
This is an inhumane business.
Joint efforts are required here at EU level.
I do not believe it is.
A common policy is required in this area.
A distinction must be made.
Who is really responsible?
What we are doing is treating the symptoms.
We are doing nothing about the real disease.
There will be fewer suppliers and ever more demand.
That means higher prices.
We are not treating the disease.
Criminal law cannot be removed from parliamentary debate.
That is the reality.
'Everything but arms' the proposal was called.
We must address these challenges as one wide-ranging issue.
I would say not.
That is why we need these measures.
We must do more.
But we cannot do that overnight.
.
Why?
But what will the consequence be?
I really do not understand at all.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Research guidelines 2002 - 2006
Let us do away with techno-nationalism.
More coordination at a programme level is also necessary.
That is laid down in the Treaty.
That was successful too.
I think that needs pointing out.
I think we must not be overcautious.
We must make that cooperation strong and vigorous.
Three, we must also consider introducing new tools.
Five, we must continue to promote pure science.
I welcome that.
(Applause from the gallery)
European research cannot fill this gap.
(Applause)
We shall try to assist you in your efforts.
The devil is not only in the detail.
All I can say is 'Have fun!'
Is that not so?
It has become a political fact.
We must consider how we propose to achieve this.
There is no distinction.
These are not 'giant' centres of excellence.
It will be a major theme of that discussion.
How should we define it?
You referred to the meeting on nuclear fusion.
Clearly there is also the question of international cooperation.
Thank you very much for your address, Commissioner.
We certainly did not find it too long.
It was very relevant and much appreciated.
Then matters will be even more clearly defined.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Aid system for cotton
The Community needs 4.5 million tonnes of unginned cotton.
Since then, international prices have doubled.
What do we propose?
The production of cotton is very labour-intensive.
He has been very willing to listen.
This amendment makes a significant proposal.
The risk of excessive costs no longer exists.
In fact, costs are now minimal.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Financing of quality and marketing improvement plans
Cereals are a case in point.
The aid we are proposing now really is necessary.
It is right to do so.
Walnuts are imported from the United States.
We are happy to show solidarity.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It is important to note that simplification.
Simplification is often heralded but rarely achieved.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.

Korakas Report (A5-0022/2001)
"What's the matter?"
I replied.
I am tired of rising from the lake naked.
I am cold, absolutely freezing.
The Commission's proposals for cotton are unacceptable because:
the European Union produces too little cotton
the principle of Community preference is being blatantly violated
hundreds of thousands of family holdings depend on cotton production
the minimum guaranteed quantities do not match actual production.
We therefore need to:
cost inflation over recent years into the price of cotton
exempt small growers from coresponsibility levies
take special steps to support small growers.
All aid to exports and production should be abolished.
We therefore have to import the balance.
And all this benefits the United States and Australia.
Now we have cotton too.
Both crops have their disadvantages.
Tobacco is bad for public health.
Izquierdo Rojo Report (A5-0035/2001)
"In Europe, not enough hazelnuts are grown.
We must increase hazelnut production," it said.
Restructuring operations and mergers in industry
(PPE-DE), in writing.
More regulation is the problem, not the solution.
These layoffs must therefore be banned.
However, we have reservations on the resolution itself.
However there are aspects which are not supported.
Paragraph 6 is not supported by the EPLP.

TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Situation in Kosovo
Once again we are suffering from total amnesia.
I find this perfectly unacceptable.
All eyes are on Belgrade.
What is the task of the EU?
We are speaking today about southern Serbia and Kosovo.
I agree with Mr Lagendijk on this point.
Now we have the subject of southern Serbia.
Why should we not play a part?
We are good mediators.
There is no-one from the press.
It is both paradoxical and frivolous.
But now to the topic itself.
This is a real scandal.
The present problems cannot be solved overnight.
Only the European Union enjoys that level of trust.
It must be different in the Balkans.
We certainly share this concern.
This is indeed important.
Milosevic never attempted to do so.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
The young Kabila has awakened high expectations.
The time has now come for him to act.
Others mainly try to secure their own economic interests.
There are limits to cynicism.
The poor Congo could be rich.
We shall certainly be monitoring developments closely.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
Freedom of expression in Pakistan
Religious freedoms in the People's Republic of China
The resolution is a good text.
That is a great pity.
This process needs to be reactivated.
It is the opium of the people."
The Tibetans are persecuted.
Tashi delek!
Torture is on the increase.
There is frequent use of the death penalty.
Freedom of expression is limited.
Catholics report systematic persecution.
Mosques are burned down.
At least 137 people have died in prison.
That is completely unacceptable.
Laos
But things are hardly any better in neighbouring countries.
They were convicted of treason.
We now wish to see an improvement.
The compromise resolution is well-balanced, clear and specific.
They must be able to contribute freely.
Inflation is currently running at over 30%.
Guinea-Conakry
But, all this is not enough.
The causes of this humanitarian disaster must be tackled.
Liberia is the destabilising factor in the region.
The situation is critical.
We can help to achieve this.
I have a question to put to the Council.
At first, that did not apply to Guinea.
There is nowhere else for the refugees to go.
There is a great deal at stake.
The whole region seems to be heading for chaos.
Nigeria
Freedom of expression in Pakistan
The Blasphemy Act must be repealed.
It must be abolished.
These individuals' lives are now at risk.
The situation in Pakistan is very disquieting.
We fully support CEDEAO' s attempts at mediation.
You raised the problem of refugees.
What can the Commission do in the meantime?
Situation in Chechnya
You are committing genocide.
But you won' t succeed.
Because we shall simply outstrip you in population growth.'
He is also a doctor and a surgeon.
I believe that his eyewitness account is particularly important.
The self-deception is happening here.
The first requirement is intensive dialogue.
Sweeping condemnations, however, are unhelpful.
This involves travel permits and the possibilities for communication.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Natural disasters
Earthquake in India
Earthquake in India
I tabled an amendment to withdraw this paragraph.
Help is flooding in.
And what actions have the Indians themselves taken?
We should applaud the efforts of our Indian friends.
Floods in Portugal
I repeat that what is needed is exceptional aid.
The second issue concerns my country, Portugal.
They have caused a genuine disaster.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Stability plans in Ireland and France
A domestic market in the original sense.
Ireland achieves surpluses.
In this respect clearly something must be done.
The same applies to social security systems and education.
Just imagine a different situation.
Now, turning to my second question.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We are talking about general, overall positions.
I would turn now to a third factor.
That is something we can discuss.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
An opinion, Commissioner, rather than a recommendation.
Was a recommendation an even-handed and proportionate response?
This latest episode does not help.
I deplore the stance taken by the Irish Government.
That really is a peculiar observation to make.
Ireland' s economy is prospering.
Last year, growth increased by 10 per cent.
Last year, growth increased by 10 per cent.
The Netherlands now has higher inflation.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Our debt/ GDP ratio is only 39%.
Ireland's GDP in 1991 was IEP29 billion.
It is now 10 years later IEP80 billion.
Today we have a budget surplus.
Today we have 1.67 million.
But on closer inspection it is nevertheless correct.
There is a financial time bomb ticking away.
Meanwhile the Commissioner is still not speaking unambiguously.
On this point Ireland has everything well under control.
It would be opportunistic to conceal this.
We do not believe that this is the case.
I have no pat answer to this question.
Ireland does not spend excessively.
This imbalance has been upset.
Imagine that they had to do this next year.
I do not think that would be possible.
This is certainly the current scenario.
Can we really not trust the Irish?
Not at all.
However, much greater risks lie in wait.
This is absolute political stupidity to say the least.
We must not let this happen.
We will not and cannot tolerate this continuing.
I want to thank Parliament for debating this issue.
That was important.
He was told it by the central banks.
The minister is reputed to be a sportsman.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
No-one begrudges Ireland its fantastic growth.
Just look, they say.
The EU will even obtain power over our taxes.
I think that propaganda of that kind is nonsense.
The EU has issued a recommendation.
Reference was made to a greater degree of understanding.
We could talk in much more detail.
In my opinion, it is justified.
Is our approach wrong?
The decision was not approved by chance.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
The situation was the same last month.
Mr President, I have another suggestion.
I think that we are departing from the agenda.
VOTE
This is exactly the procedure scheduled, Mr Wurtz.
I did not suggest starting earlier on a Monday.
That was my suggestion.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 7 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Agenda
These two reports will be taken off the agenda.
Relating to Thursday:
This debate will not conclude with a resolution.
Are there any objections to these amendments?
Madam President, this is not really an objection.
The agenda is thus adopted.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
I await your explanation.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, it is perfectly clear.
Mr Prodi will perhaps clarify matters.
(Applause and laughter)
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, how delightful!
Thank you, Mrs Karamanou.
I think this is a reasonable decision.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Commission reform: human resources
There had not been a complete reorganisation for decades.
We will return to those details on future occasions.
I thank them and I pay tribute to them.
It certainly contradicts the crude caricatures of the Eurocrat.
That requires investing finance, time and effort.
These proposals are all available to the House.
We will fulfil that commitment.
That hope has been fully realised.
I hope our partnership will continue.
Therefore it is very important that he be here.
That is understood amongst the staff.
I have encountered no sour attitudes.
I should like to address two problems.
That does not signify a reluctance to make change.
They need clear guidance.
What plans do you have in this respect?
That has changed somewhat.
I hope that custom will also be emulated.
They are not.
They are excellent news for all other staff.
(Protests from Mr Bigliardo)
I regret that.
In Strasbourg, Mr Howitt!
This is an unbearable situation.
Mr Poettering, you were there with Mr Berlusconi.
You were at this meeting as a special witness.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is also a possible solution!
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
I had two points.
The first concerned the bombings in Iraq.
The second point concerns Moldavia.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is not a point of order!
I congratulate you.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Draft SAB 1/2001
And that really is not an easy task.
It is the proverbial drop in the ocean.
But these times are well and truly over.
We have to break away from this system.
This is business as usual in other words.
He killed people, not animals.
There is a difference between humans and animals.
Let us not forget that.
The expenditure ceiling will soon be in sight.
That will not enhance our credibility.
We must put an end to this situation.
We are not only dealing with a financial crisis.
But this cannot be achieved overnight.
That is simply not feasible.
We have to be honest enough to admit this.
Let me make this very clear.
There is no more after this.
Is that sensible?
In the view of my group it is not.
What has the Commission done on this point?
We are witnessing a substantial loss of confidence everywhere.
We need a change of policy course.
We cannot, however, leave it at that.
But then what will we do?
There are sufficient funds for that.
Please, let us keep to this.
I cannot let that pass.
The supplementary budget provides the right answers.
This is probably mostly wishful thinking.
That was Mrs Schreyer's proposal.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Europe is guilty.
Europe must make amends.
The European Union does not actually levy taxes.
In any event, we will see.
So we must all join together to change it.
We cannot ignore this fact.
That is quite correct.
And we will remind you of that very soon.
Today, our house is on fire.
That is not all, however.
That is not the problem that we face.
You have our full support.
Firstly, the obligatory costs.
It will take time to restore confidence.
Above all, it is necessary.
We cannot go on producing for meat mountains.
It is probably not.
That means that more will need to be done.
It is impossible to go beyond that level.
We must do this in a calm way.
It is not as simple as that.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
It is actually a relatively small amount.
We should remember that.
So what are the solutions to the problem?
Is it only about quantity?
To what extent is quality also an issue?
It is important to make this clear.
And what about the ethical issues involved?
These are factors which have to be considered.
We will be discussing the second package this week.
But we have to agree something at this stage.
We must be prepared for this possibility.
Thank you very much, Mr Mulder.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Foot-and-mouth disease
Nothing could be further from the truth.
This ban has been prolonged for another fortnight.
My firm intention is to maintain that success.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.
The next item is Question Time.
He also mentioned vaccination as a further possibility.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have two questions.
Are you well prepared?
Thank you, Commissioner, for coming today.
I also echo Mr Adam' s feelings.
Could the Commissioner answer two quick questions.
Have we finally sorted the problem of infected sheep?
It would be an enormous decision with many implications.
There is also EU legislation.
Mr Sturdy then asked me two questions.
The answer to that question is no.
Could the Commissioner give us any update on that?
We should at least exercise some caution here.
Could he be a little more specific on that?
Obviously, there is active surveillance of the situation.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf asked me about compensation.
That is my first question.
Your views on this please.
Mr President, I have three questions.
Can you say anything about this?
Is that true?
What is the percentage that cannot be traced?
I should like to make one further observation.
Movements have been restricted.
You say that it has to be licensed.
I think there are problems with this licensing.
All this needs to be tightened up.
At this time those animals have all been tested.
I should like to ask the Commissioner one question.
He referred to intensive farming.
That concludes this item.
Electronic communications
Roaming warranted more detailed consideration.
Lastly, environmental impact.
Apart from anything else, the timing was unfortunate.
Turning now to the authorisation directive and my report.
Laying long telecommunications cables is an expensive business.
They have to obtain planning permission.
That concludes the introduction to my report.
I refer to Amendment No 78.
Telecommunications are changing our lives at a fast pace.
I believe that this is exemplary in this House.
To return to the reports.
Fifteen separate national electronic communications markets cannot work.
That is the priority.
Finally, Mrs Niebler' s report.
Nevertheless there is still no single internal telecom market.
Think, for example of the UMTS auctions.
Mr van Velzen has already pointed this out.
Auctions should be avoided wherever possible.
The European Greens have a clear attitude towards liberalisation.
A great deal has been said about technological neutrality.
So where does this take us?
And that means fair access.
This communication must be free.
We want open digital communications.
No, we cannot.
The auctions have sabotaged the e-Europe project.
They have weakened democracy.
They have caused telephone charges to go sky-high.
Our group supports this.
I want to try and avoid that.
I concur.
We have had difficulty in reconciling the texts.
We are actually finding excuses for regulating.
The rapporteurs have done excellent work here.
What are we actually about here?
We are looking for a genuine pan-European single market.
These are important steps in that direction.
Second point: NRAs.
They cannot have their cake and eat it.
I just leave that as a question mark.
I tabled similar amendments in the Culture Committee.
That is meaningless without these amendments.
It is a small change.
These are not just any reports.
The second key element is the SMP definition.
The Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 39 and 40.
This is the conditional access for digital television.
This regime has worked well.
We know the facts.
The single market is fragmented.
More than ever we need to work together.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Effects of globalisation on Mediterranean women immigrants
This concept raises legal problems.
They are more vulnerable to abusive practices.
What is the purpose of this initiative?
I therefore appeal to the rapporteur.
I would ask you sincerely to consider this option.
The previous speaker made this point.
I shall mention a few.
A second point.
It sounds very limited.
A third point.
The report talks of Euro-Mediterranean citizenship.
Does such a thing exist?
Will we have Euro-ACP citizenship or Euro-Mercosur citizenship?
A higher status, or a lower one?
Such a measure might well lead to discrimination.
And I could go on.
We therefore welcome these two points.
The main aspects are correctly presented in the report.
The report considers that all is not well here.
The report should cover these tasks more amply.
The promotion of proactive gender equality is very necessary.
This is a matter of equality.
It is also about democracy and solidarity.
Equal representation is a key issue here.
Structural changes are required to make them more audible.
Many of these things are well-known, well-established challenges.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Development policy
I would stress one further point.
It deserves the same accolade from the House.
Trade is the key.
I applaud much of its thinking.
We in Parliament must support its efforts.
'Everything but Arms' is a major step forward.
Small-scale help for entrepreneurs must not be abandoned.
The priority within the six is also important.
Mr Gemelli' s report is good.
All of these issues affect our everyday policy.
We therefore hope that this report bears fruit.
It is a question of effectiveness.
We must take away this fundamental ambiguity.
I oppose that.
I could go on asking questions.
I am thinking of agricultural subsidies, for example.
Then there is health policy.
Can I begin by being self-critical of this Parliament.
The test is implementation.
I thank him for that.
Such failure has left many countries poorer today.
How can this be?
What are the reasons for this?
In my opinion, there is one basic reason.
This is the point.
So what is the risk now, Commissioner Nielson?
In other words, they are twice excluded.
I have seen no sign of this.
Luxembourg has just made it above 0.7%.
Norway is around 0.9%.
So it is fine that we have the G7.
Fortunately for development cooperation we also have the G0.7.
This is in any case a complex issue.
Mr Rod also mentioned access to medicines.
The Member States have now decided.
But we have become mainstream.
This is where we are now.
We never had that before.
So it is valuable.
Another big drama will be the actual delivery.
Highly migratory fish stocks
We must change this system, Commissioner.
The EU must be more flexible on this question.
I only have two points I want to make.
After all the stocks need our help.
I simply wish to emphasise two important aspects.
This is a crucial aspect that we must resolve.
I think that this is a fundamental point.
I am delighted that Parliament also supports this idea.
Hence our proposal of financial support.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
EC/Equatorial Guinea fisheries agreement
The protocol concerns tuna only.
This should also be the case with Equatorial Guinea.
Of course, this is nothing new.
Anything less is shameful.
I have one specific question for Commissioner Fischler.
The question is in relation to flags of convenience.
We need a reply.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
Thank you, Mr Wuermeling.
Air strikes in Iraq
We must not lose sight of the basic objective.
(Applause from the PPE Group)
Politically speaking, they are ineffective.
Legally, they can be called into question.
Morally speaking, they are intolerable.
We do not know what has happened to them.
We have to keep looking.
I visited Iran.
Let us not forget those people either.
I have been to Kurdistan.
I have seen the results of the chemical weapons.
And why?
This man is a monster.
It is not recklessness it is ruthlessness.
This man is indeed a modern Hitler.
(Applause from the centre and the right)
We could talk at great length about this issue.
We have already said this about the Echelon affair.
The technology for chemical weapons flowed to Baghdad.
He is still there.
But all those children who have died are not.
What did they know about sanctions?
Everyone can draw their own conclusions from this.
And who had the last laugh?
Saddam Hussein, of course!
And what is at stake?
The risky revitalisation of Mesopotamia no less.
That is the basis for our entire discussion.
The European Union is actively participating in that discussion.
These are difficult issues.
They are important.
Hospitals can no longer provide care.
Schools can no longer remain open.
Most of the population is illiterate.
Finding food is an achievement.
Access to information is controlled.
Let us move in this direction.
I am sure that we all agree.
The problem is how to do it.
It is disgraceful.
It is quite disgraceful.
There is no bombing campaign against Iraq.
The debate is closed.
Association agreements
Why should it make such a request?
This is now regrettably as dead as a doornail.
Point 2 should end with the initials GATT.
It is also the main supplier to the area.
This agreement is therefore extremely important.
The proposals have already been outlined by both rapporteurs.
I therefore only wish to highlight two points.
This basis must be Article 310 of the Treaty.
Nonetheless, this support is tinged with criticism.
No environmental measures have been adopted either.
They constitute a particularly important set of documents.
This has a particular bearing on economics and trade.
It also has great potential for growth.
For us, he is just across the Atlantic.
This is necessary to ensure world peace.
The negotiations are well on track.
It was a considerable success.
Negotiating texts have been exchanged.
First the matter of the legal base.
Our future strategic partnership goes well beyond trade.
I agree with this opinion.
Then labour rights.
These are also an integral part of the negotiations.
I come to greater political cooperation including security.
Transparency and accountability are essential.
Civil society should be part of the agreement.
Negotiations are in full swing.
Preparations for the next round are on track.
The Commission strongly believes that there should be.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended until 11 a.m.)

[2000/2017(INI)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)President.
That concludes the votes.
Thank you very much.
The man was not allowed entry to the House.
I believe that this condition is crucial.
Europe must change its attitude to immigration.
Haug report (A5-0064/2001)
This view is also expressed in the report.
I therefore voted in favour of it.
The Financial Perspective must be revised.
Our choice was therefore limited, however regrettable.
We voted against this paragraph.
It is not on their agenda.
Finally this is a budgetary matter only.
That time is not now.
Yet, that is not the most important point.
We do not.
With these reservations, we support the report.
Brunetta report (A5-0061/2001)
Why did I vote for it?
There are many good aspects to the Brunetta report.
The latter is an unduly detailed regulation.
Paasilinna report (A5-0053/2001)
So how could I not vote for this report?
These regulations must provide consistency throughout the Community.
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.
Niebler report (A5-0062/2001)
I therefore voted against Amendment 21.
Varela Suanzes-Carpegna reports (A5-0047 and 0046/2001)
Why does she envy him?
Control is a very delicate and important matter.
Maybe some generous soul, but very few.
PiÃ©trasanta report (A5-0051/2001)
Gallagher report (A5-0044/2001)
It is still about tuna.
AvilÃ©s Perea report (A5-0058/2001)
That was not the case with this report.
Gemelli report (A5-0059/2001)
The current figures are proof of our resounding failure.
Marset Campos report (A5-0049/2001)
We must therefore strengthen bipartite dialogue at all levels.
Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra report (A5-0050/2001)
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting closed at 12.15 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Tribute
They both passed away on 3 March 2001.
Statement by the President
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
We are currently discussing the approval of the Minutes.
This will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.
We export 90% of our entire production.
Thank you, Mr Hyland.
I cannot take this step, however.
The House will judge whether this request is admissible.
There is one problem, however.
I entirely agree with Mr Swoboda.
It is therefore a matter of urgency.
There was no vote for a resolution.
You can so decide under your authority as President.
(The House gave its assent)
We have to stop live exports.
We are not contravening the Rules of Procedure.
Some Members made a request.
This is perfectly standard practice.
The next requirement is for the truth.
I just wanted to speak briefly.
(The House rejected the request)
Normally this Parliament is consulted on a Commission proposal.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
Relating to Thursday: President.
Yet, Spain is not the only country concerned.
Similar projects exist in Italy, France and Portugal.
(Parliament gave its assent)
The order of business is thus agreed.
Speeches relating to points of order
Please go ahead, Mr Schulz.
You apparently delayed until mid-February before requesting a response.
That is an awful lot of months!
Thank you very much.
I look forward to your response.
Thank you, Mr Schulz.
That is the first point.
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause, heckling)
There are several precedents.
I am grateful to you for that.
We will continue to pursue this issue.
I am quite astonished by his statement.
Yes!
But this time, he has astonished me.
(Heckling)
Our full support for Mr Schulz!
I did not speak last time in Brussels.
You said that this Group was going against Austria.
Do you know who else uses this argument?
(Applause from the left)
(Applause from the left)
(Applause from the left)
I put three questions to you in all.
Is this the first time this has happened?
(Applause from the left)
Mr Schulz, thank you for asking this question.
I must say that I did wonder about this.
It is very simple.
It is a legal, not a political issue.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Six of the 16 crew lost their lives.
In the meantime, 57 people have been arrested.
The Spanish and French Governments unfortunately have not.
That is a very sad reality.
The situation has reached dramatic proportions.
Thank you, Mrs Morgantini.
Safe transport of radioactive material
This, too, is highlighted in the report.
That is far more dangerous than the transports themselves.
No one can possibly object to that.
We broadly support this view.
The all-powerful nuclear lobby pulled strings again, however.
This industry is never complacent.
It is tendentious and ill-informed.
The sooner we realise that the better.
What a paradox!
I urge everyone to keep to the facts.
This is not what the report is about.
We support and are willing to promote this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WTO negotiations on the built-in agenda
Let me pick out a few points.
The precise details are set out in the report.
But never mind!
First, two questions addressed to the Commission.
Now, two observations.
The agriculture line is not without its grey areas.
Thirdly, the line on services is not satisfactory.
There is talk of 'further progressive liberalisation' .
That is a unilateral objective.
That is not enough.
Yet is the situation really still the same?
Is that still compatible with developments?
Do we not need further deliberation on the subject?
Should more be done in the field of agriculture?
How can effective consumer protection be safeguarded?
There are many other questions as well.
Flexibility is a very broad term.
Does this document signal a move away from that?
This is of deep concern.
There are countless examples of this.
That is my first question.
What is the Commission planning to do?
What are the options for the European Union?
There is a great deal of cause for concern.
The WTO is what it is.
That is the stage we are at today.
Concerning agriculture, we agree with you.
That is part of our agenda.
Thank you, Commissioner Lamy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
COM in the sugar sector
I do not think so.
This entails strict supervision of the volumes produced.
.
That is not a blank cheque, however.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is something we are able to support.
This means that we need to repatriate our quotas.
Then it should be sustained in this way.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot endorse this report.
It makes a mockery of sound financial management.
Talk about competition!
Please do not try to mend this system.
And why until 2003?
I now turn to the content.
Commissioner, thank you for your comprehensive response.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Information and communication
The process is a tedious one, however.
Fourthly, what are the pillars?
This effort must be continued and increased manifold.
That is the problem.
This is a dreadful state of affairs.
It is like a poor orphan.
They do exist.
When I consider that you praise the Info-Points here!
You said it yourself.
There are also some thoroughly topical and practical problems.
There are too many bureaucratic obstacles to accessing information.
We have produced it in three months.
I doubt it.
You said your 'colleagues responsible for the matter.
Who are they?
We do not know them.
We would like to know who they are.
Sometimes my impatience gives way to disappointment.
Where is the specific timetable and programme of measures?
On 14 April, Commissioner Reding spoke here.
Today you have stood in for us.
There is no clear strategy.
We do not need a re-nationalisation of information policy.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I would like to make a few brief comments.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Shipbuilding
It may be disastrous for individual companies.
On the contrary, the prizes are increasing.
This line no longer exists.
I do not wish to be misunderstood.
This work has already started in collaboration with industry.
Quite the opposite.
Therefore we need to take action very quickly.
This must be done now.
It was interesting to hear about the plans.
There is not much disagreement among us.
Why?
It had to be discontinued.
It has been discontinued.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)
Opening of the Session
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Decision on urgent procedure
Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
Agenda
Are there speakers for and against the motion?
We discussed this yesterday.
That is clear.
It is a fundamental parliamentary right.
(Parliament approved the amendment to the agenda)
Carriers' liability
That would be draconian and excessive.
It is important that we deal with this matter.
These rights must be reflected in this initiative.
The other element is the right to asylum.
What would we do in the same situation?
Should he perhaps check their documents?
Whom is it imagined will profit from this?
It will be the Mafia and other unscrupulous people.
Pakistan does not want to take any more refugees.
Whom do we want them to pay?
The Mafia, or the church and humanitarian organisations?
Fewer people will offer to help future refugees.
Those who remain will be the Mafia.
That is our own responsibility.
We need more international cooperation between law enforcement agencies.
The number of applications from Iranians more than doubled.
I say that with deep regret.
We are just helping the mafia to grow richer.
This is good.
Absolutely all of them know it.
I think we should bear this in mind.
This fragmented approach is neither coherent nor sensible.
I shall be supporting Amendment No 12.
Vote against the Kirkhope report!
Not everything that is illegal is also illegitimate.
This is acknowledged even by the UNHCR.
I must say that I see it very differently.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Temporary protection for displaced persons
Of course, they deserve a dignified reception.
The present proposal outshines the previous two proposals.
That is the good news.
This is the first weak point in your draft.
This is our second serious objection.
With the new mechanism that should be avoided.
We must ensure that appropriate provisions are in place.
We do not believe that three months is acceptable.
We are asking that it should be one month.
All these are to be welcomed.
It was solidarity with ourselves.
It is, of course, absurd, really.
That is how matters stand, however.
The second important point is family reunification.
The European Union must act as one on this.
Is this only the case for Europeans?
I sincerely believe not.
I believe so.
They should not be mutually exclusive.
We have not heard the last of this.
Of course we share our responsibility.
We have to.
I cannot guarantee that the system will work.
I am a teacher by profession.
So you know what I am talking about.
Thank you Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Visas/Mutual recognition of decisions on expulsion
by Mr Deprez (A5-0066/2001),
and
That is something I find unacceptable.
The fourth error concerns Parliament directly.
This is amazingly difficult to understand.
That is quite a different kettle of fish.
We therefore propose that this initiative be rejected.
We must achieve joint consensus and consideration.
No to these three initiatives.
Their authors often seem to neglect to do so.
It seems sensible and logical.
However, things are not that straightforward.
I find this very worrying.
Exactly what happened, we do not know.
This is what Schengen cooperation should be about.
Repression alone is not enough.
We must not confuse the traffickers with their victims.
We must guarantee that freedom of movement.
I confirm that we will vote for the motion.
Perhaps there is no institutional framework?
On the contrary.
This is what causes mass immigration.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
European crime prevention network
Welcome
European crime prevention network (continuation)
We welcome this.
Most of these recommendations have been fully implemented.
Computer-related crimes do not stop at conventional State borders.
We are against this.
The Lisbon Monitoring Centre has been mentioned.
Furthermore, Hippocrates is not easy to understand.
It was very concise but extremely informative.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
VOTE

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE -Daul Report (A5-0081/2001)
Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo.
This is not a sustainable solution.
.
I am opposed to another five year roll-over.
The momentum for reform is mounting.
EU sugar prices are 2.5-3 times the world level.
Similarly, artificially high prices cannot be sustained.
.
The European citizens will understand this.
The world market in sugar is highly unstable.
Kirkhope Report (A5-0069/2001)
I welcome it.
I therefore rejected them.

These goods are highly dangerous" .
Radioactivity poses grave dangers to health and the environment.
I do not subscribe to this point of view.
Schwaiger Report (A5-0076/2001)
I voted for the motion.
And why is that?
Bon appÃ©tit!
.
Confusion continues to prevail with regard to these aspects.
.
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.
I therefore see no need to amend Community law.
These are the mechanisms intended to achieve this.
Some of their requests were met.
Will there be some compensation for them?
Firstly we must adhere to the Bosman judgment.
The second component is the solidarity fund.
.
Thank you, Mrs Reding.
Madam President, Mr Lagendijk is correct.
.
.
.
And nothing has changed since then.
So, I hope this is perfectly clear.
I have a question regarding the latter.
Is anything known about this yet?
.
.
Everyone understands this.
That is a benefit for sportsmen and women.
I have two short questions.
.
The terms of the agreement appear to be positive.
It was certainly a matter that needed regulating.
So what will the next the stage be?
.
I know FIFA has recommended it.
What would happen if that legal challenge is successful?
.
There was a demand for this system.
.
I certainly hope that this is the case.
That is what constitutes the social dimension of sport.
How could sport in Europe exist without these people?
You are quite right, Mrs Matikainen.
That is not what we want.
Thank you, Mrs Reding.
The debate is closed.
Evidence in civil and commercial matters
What is the ultimate aim of this German initiative?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Fight against fraud
The Commission's position on this is inconsistent.
That would require an amendment to the Treaties.
There are plenty of those already.
We need another great leap forward.
Independence is a great good.
That discrepancy will need to be done away with.
Allow me to comment on the sore points.
First of all, OLAF' s necessary independence.
Second sore point: the European Public Prosecutor.
Third sore point: the cooperation between Member States.
Fourth sore point: the disclosure of information.
It is a difficult matter.
The Commission knows what it is.
This will not do.
Mr BÃ¶sch is right.
To the Commission, transparency is an opaque word.
We need an independent OLAF able to operate efficiently.
I must congratulate Herbert BÃ¶sch on his excellent report.
Incidentally, that not only concerns defrauding Community coffers.
The cooperation of national prosecutors is not enough.
, Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
We must do our best to protect it.
Parliament and the relevant institutions should do precisely that.
Lastly, there is also administrative liability.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
This question is certainly still open.
I hope that will happen in April.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The debate will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Public access to environmental information
The Commission text clearly covered privatised utilities.
Information is every citizen' s right.
Finally, I have problems with Amendment No 24.
This is entirely in line with the Aarhus Convention.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Question Time (Commission)
We shall deal with questions to the Commission.
Part I
Question No 47 by (H-0191/01):
That is the procedure.
Question No 48 by (H-0193/01):
Perhaps it was not conveyed through the interpretation.
I should like to repeat it if I may.
He has not provided an answer to these queries.
Mr President, there is only one slaughter premium.
Question No 49 by (H-0137/01):
I am talking about the next one.
Question No 50 by (H-0149/01):
The Commission shares his concerns.
Mere talk will not placate them.
The Commission is active in improving the situation.
That is something that would require further research.
Question No 51 by (H-0226/01):
These words have prompted concern amongst trade-union organisations.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Verheugen
This is the aid commonly known as readaptation aid.
I fully share much of what she says.
We have major acquisitions and mergers across Europe.
This is what I have just explained.
In this case there are three main elements.
You can use the ECSC Treaty.
We only have one year now to use it.
The Asturias can be subsidised under the Treaty.
Secondly you can use the European framework.
Question No 52 by (H-0134/01):
What is going to happen?
What is going to happen?
Are both sides equally to blame?
What initiatives does the Commission intend to take?
I am not aware of any such plans.
You asked what happens next.
Thank you, Mr President.
Question No 53 by (H-0220/01):
What do I find conceivable?
Our talks are still in their infancy.
Question No 54 by (H-0238/01):
Questions to Commissioner Reding
Is there information available on how they do that?
Responsibility is spread somewhat more widely.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Question No 55 by (H-0188/01):
.
One Member State has already done so.
I just want to thank her for that.
Question No 56 by (H-0219/01):
Question No 57 by (H-0239/01):
Question No 58 by (H-0245/01):
Questions to Commissioner Barnier
Not one was excluded.
Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
We need a preventive strategy.
Question No 59 by (H-0132/01):
Certainly not.
I would therefore like to know what is happening.
The second point obviously relates to quality.
This is a very important point.
In actual fact, I am rather against them.
The reasons differ depending on the location.
No doubt there have been delays.
This is the reality.
Question No 60 by (H-0142/01):
Question No 61 by (H-0144/01):
They are unsatisfactory, particularly for Community initiatives.
Thank you, Commissioner Barnier.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Emissions of pollutants from large combustion plants
That plan did not work.
All credit to the Spanish.
That cannot be the intention of European environmental legislation.
There were no hands raised when I looked round.
I am sorry.
(Laughter)
Is that so?
The approach is right.
I believe the rapporteur has presented a good report.
We should continue along this path.
The proposal has now reached its second reading.
We are very mindful of that.
Acidification was a buzz word in the 80s.
That is when it all started.
We have a long way to go yet.
Rapporteur Oomen-Ruijten has made sound proposals to this effect.
Secondly, the bizarre exemption provisions must be deleted.
I have proposed an adaptation in Amendment No 43.
That is something we are really all agreed on.
That is what this directive is about.
That is something which Members must not forget.
We are on the right road.
Nothing would remain of the high ambitions entertained.
Some of the proposed amendments will be counterproductive.
This is contained in Amendment No 36.
Some amendments will even have a perverse effect.
Our ecosystem continues to suffer from acidification and eutrophification.
Let me turn to the key issues under discussion.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
National emission ceilings for pollutants
I hope this position will prove successful tomorrow.
Other causes for concern are industry and traffic.
Member States therefore have to do something about it.
Traffic is a real challenge.
That seems highly ambitious to us.
Thank you, Mr President.
Certain people appear now to be denying these figures.
The list could extend much further.
It will go no further, it says.
I would like Member States to be more ambitious.
There are four polluting substances involved.
It is nothing personal.
What about the Greeks?
Mrs MÃ¼ller has addressed this problem.
Does subsidiarity apply here or not?
I also want to comment on the unemployment argument.
We must solve these problems.
Amendments Nos 11 and 12 explain this very clearly.
That is perhaps important information.
That was also noted in the discussions in Council.
The Commission must therefore reject Amendment No 4.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Environmental inspections
It did not.
So maybe no meeting of minds was possible.
I regard this entire law-making exercise as a failure.
There was simply no proper dialogue between the institutions.
We have to concentrate on implementation.
We will put pressure on Member States.
It is a good reminder for the Member States.
I should like to acknowledge IMPEL's role.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Motor vehicle heating systems
There are two further amendments on this.
This is not a job for Parliament.
This is an important directive.
We should not underestimate the importance of it.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Energy efficiency
Some people propose renewable energy sources.
One major problem is that energy savings are invisible.
The second issue is the protection of resources.
My last point concerns public tendering and centralised procurement.
This is unusually good working together.
There is no energy chapter in the Treaty.
That is what disappoints me about this action plan.
The case for energy efficiency is clear and unanswerable.
All are helped by energy efficiency.
Why is this not happening automatically?
Please bring it forward again.
This action plan of the Commission's is unambitious.
We can look at energy appliances.
However, I am dubious about voluntary agreements.
We all agree that it is a good thing.
That is the way forward to achieve energy efficiency.
The question is how we can implement it all.
It took many years before the buildings were refurbished.
Why?
Consumers bear responsibility too, not only legislators.
On that we are in complete agreement.
Human behaviour is essential.
We must not squander it.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Thank you very much.
(The sitting was closed at 11.14 p.m.)
Today alone 1500 EU citizens will die from smoking.
Thank you, Mrs Stihler.
Thank you, Mr Watson.
Fine, thank you, Mrs Banotti.
Follow-up to Nice
I would like to welcome the President-in-Office.
Mrs Lindh, you now have the floor.
A strong Europe requires strong institutions.
It will be built through concrete achievements.
It is important to remember this even today.
Let the debate begin.
What do we want to do together?
What will our plan be?
Do we want more integration or not?
The second principle is that of proximity.
However, dialogue over the Internet is not enough.
The third principle could be that of anticipation.
Having said that, many questions remain open.
What will its composition be?
What will its mandate be?
And we ourselves are working on this.
(Applause) Now to the follow-up to Nice.
This conference should start work in 2002.
Europe must be strong.
Europe must be able to act.
(Applause)
You have launched a website.
This debate must yield results.
This is an absolutely decisive question.
I join you in that.
This Parliament has a democratic legitimacy.
It is rooted and founded in the European treaties.
The Internet is not enough, Madam President.
We need a different method.
Of course we do.
How must this be done?
This debate is very important and cannot be closed.
That is what we call the convention method.
The parliamentary groups are whistling the same tune.
The important issue is how to get there.
A new method is vital.
Subsidiarity is a two-ended concept.
Mr President, I have two things to say.
I am therefore also sceptical regarding the convention method.
My second point concerns content.
It is actively anti-democratic.
The idea is to establish a democratic dialogue.
This method would be very dangerous.
This would spell disaster for Europe.
So let us look at the future debate.
First, its nature.
Secondly, the breadth.
You were not talking about democracy.
Brok (PPE-DE).
(Applause)
So there remains the European Parliament.
That is what the citizens expect from you.
Thank you.
I will give an example.
I agree with you wholeheartedly there.
But actions speak louder than words.
It means more integration, not less integration.
I was a member of the Charter convention.
I saw no disadvantages.
I saw only advantages.
One last word on the timetable.
I too think that 2004 is wholly inappropriate.
What needs to be done?
Finally, Madam President, you mentioned citizens.
There must have been eleven socialist governments in Nice.
Let us not beat about the bush.
Let us look towards the future.
Let us take note of this.
The experience of the Charter demonstrated this.
One last word, Mr President.
The Council was courageous enough to invent the convention.
Our citizens expect this.
Some answers please.
But how do they fit in with the facts?
You were in Nice.
What does the real future look like on paper?
The loser at Nice was the European Parliament.
And everything is obscure.
What is it you really want?
What is it you stand for?
Where exactly are you reacting?
Where do we stand with the Council?
What is wrong with Sweden?
I trust that Sweden will yet dare to act.
I am relying on your ambition.
These issues were addressed by the initial speakers.
We cannot reach a final position on this today.
Some have also put forward the disadvantages.
We should therefore discuss this properly and in detail.
Let me now comment on some other issues.
I reply that I was quoting the Nice Decision.
This is naturally an important debate for the future.
And that is what counts.
It was opened barely a week ago.
We will continue to work together.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Wish that I could do likewise.
It is about full employment within the EU.
It is about quality of work and lifelong learning.
It is about social and economic reforms.
We need a balance between social and economic reforms.
We do not need any new processes.
Instead, we should point out certain prioritised areas.
You can therefore contact them with your comments.
This is in our common interest.
I look forward to hearing your opinions.
Firstly: the Community patent.
Secondly: the GALILEO programme.
We must therefore take action now.
Firstly: intergenerational equity.
Secondly: the distribution of work.
Not everyone of working age actually works.
This aggravates the long-term strain on the pension systems.
Fourthly and lastly: immigration.
This process must be enhanced.
No.
Has Ireland succeeded through regulation?
The remedies for improved employment levels are simple.
That is very reassuring, Mr President.
Public deficits have been reduced.
Salary increases have been in line with productivity gains.
Not everything is perfect in Europe, of course.
There is not enough investment in research.
We can do better in many areas.
Deregulation does not mean the lack of regulation.
The new economy has nevertheless experienced problems.
Any new technology is just a tool.
We are not satisfied.
Firstly, structural reforms and liberalisation.
Meeting the needs of our citizens is therefore crucial.
My second comment is about the instruments.
Mr President, the Lisbon decisions were unique.
At that time I was very surprised.
The social profile is very weak.
This is good.
These are two different things.
My political group considers that this is very serious.
Now, we are heading in the opposite direction.
Time has run out for the Swedish Presidency.
This presents us with two challenges.
In practice, Sweden has done the opposite.
So how will that work?
The Lisbon Document talked a great deal about knowledge.
Swedish universities are in crisis.
We must have the courage to set decisive priorities.
These guidelines are clear and unequivocal.
That emphasis recognises what is already clear.
What happened?
Not a thing!
The Council did not adopt a common position.
Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Signed: JoÃ£o Correa' .
How can this happen?
VOTE

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTEJackson report (A5-0041/2001)
Recommendation for second reading Oomen-Ruijten (A5-0068/2001)
'Who' s that?'
I replied.
'Me who?'
'Me, Carlo Fatuzzo!
I' m Mr Fatuzzo the man.'
Recommendation for second reading Myller (A5-0067/2001)
Ammonia is surely used for cleaning in every household!
All Member States have signed the protocol.
Recommendation for Second Reading Miller (A5-0055/2001)
Korhola report (A5-0074/2001)
The environment is under enormous pressure.
Poverty is increasing throughout the globe.
Local authorities must also freely give information when requested.
Disclosure could cost them money.
The internet revolution has transformed the world.
The dot com world is too important to ignore.
Angelilli report (A5-0070/2001)
I feel the time has come to change that.
This is an extremely dangerous approach.
Tackling cross-border crime together is essential.
Marinho report (A5-0073/2001)
President.
BÃ¶sch report (A5-0078/2001)
I supported the overall impact of the BÃ¶sch report.
I fully subscribe to this idea.
The European Union collects and distributes funding.
These stockpiles are partly the result of subsidies.
.
Wijkman report (A5-0054/2001)
This should strengthen international competitiveness in the long term.
The economy is based on secure energy supplies.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
The Lisbon Summit was held about a year ago.
Social policy is a productive factor.
It is particularly important to incorporate the ecological issues.
And why, colleagues, is that?
But what did she mention?
I think there is food for thought here.
Nothing less than that.
That is why I think Stockholm is so important.
This must be clearly reflected in the employment guidelines.
That was a year ago.
Are we any closer to the plans?
The Member States have started on numerous structural reforms.
That is a very serious issue.
Employers have to be made to recognise their responsibilities.
We still have directives on how to climb ladders.
Allow me to comment on some of the issues.
I cannot understand this.
Obviously, a strong economy is vital for welfare.
Lifelong learning is an important issue for Europe.
Mr Andersson mentions environmental technology.
This applies to matters such as temporary agency work.
The debate is closed.
Conflict prevention and crisis management
All three concepts are interconnected.
Hence the high ranking.
These are closely linked.
The basic causes of armed conflict must be removed.
Therefore, development work has a key role.
The UN is our most important partner.
Similarly, we are strengthening relations with the OSCE.
ECOWAS' small arms moratorium is a good example.
An initial reconciliation will take place in May.
He has raised an important debate.
Let me be clear.
I very much hope that it will hold.
The Commission is responding to this challenge.
We will certainly keep Parliament fully informed.
This is, I think, an important point.
I think that is an important political point.
I would like to start on a practical note.
This meeting will prove to be of overriding importance.
There is a whole gamut of mechanisms involved.
The European Union must be complementary to NATO.
Tackling the root causes is another problem.
Society is seriously destabilised by organised crime.
Capacity building is another critical point.
I urge the Commission to support those functions.
Finally, of course, accountability.
The Kosovo crisis showed us that.
Post-war costs rock the EU budget every time.
It takes time and it is not very spectacular.
The EU has this potential.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Our support cannot therefore be total.
The then Macedonia was about to explode.
Commissioner Patten has now taken charge of this case.
The question of the university should be resolved.
This is the situation in Macedonia.
This is the situation we find ourselves in.
It is important that these are widely known.
However, I cannot hide my true concern.
What can an international organisation do?
We are looking forward to April.
Today, everything is completely cut and dried.
It is that simple.
But there are also economic causes.
More must be done to protect children.
Tetovo University is a typical example.
What lessons has it learned?
Has it been of use to you?
The Commission did not act on this suggestion.
Nor did the Council.
Does the Commission intend to take it up?
Has the Council buried it?
For the European Union, what a splendid victory.
I share the honourable Member' s view fully.
We should all denounce it vigorously.
It is extremely important.
I hope we can in future.
The debate is closed.
Regulation of European securities markets
All three institutions have a contribution to make here.
The focus is on fully implementing the action plan.
We are all obliged to follow this legal framework.
That goes without saying.
I cannot agree with that.
I will not repeat them.
Of course, we must respect the treaties.
Yes, we have rights in the primary legislation.
But there is a feedback system in this.
Will we give them a millimetre or a metre?
A metre or a kilometre?
No callback - no wide latitude.
We have a big choice to make.
What are we pursuing here?
It is not simply a closed loop.
This is not acceptable.
So we have a method which is totally inappropriate.
Foot-and-mouth disease
It is immensely infectious and deadly.
It also causes major financial damage and great suffering.
Three factors in particular are disturbing.
There is no consumer risk.
We have brought the Irish community to a standstill.
The EU reaction has been inadequate and slow.
They have explained the situation in England.
We need more details from Argentina.
It is in Europe; hence my questions.
How did this virus get to Europe from Asia?
Thank you very much.
Nevertheless, I wonder whether that was enough.
This does not happen in Europe.
We must know how much it will cost.
Let us stop seeing it as a health crisis.
Let us stop mixing up the issues.
Commissioner, what has happened to the tests?
Secondly, you are corrupting the precautionary principle.
But it is not worthwhile commercially.
So get things into perspective and propose valid solutions.
Yes, you are slaughtering animals.
The priority is to get out of the crisis.
It is not enough!
Eight hours is too long to transport live animals!
A stop must be put to this system.
Allow me to make three observations.
Where will the money come from?
A third and final observation.
The financial implications are considerable.
I certainly sympathise with the plight of British farmers.
The second error is the race to achieve profitability.
The third error is that of immigration.
Mr President, we have to face facts.
The massive abattoirs have changed nothing.
We are losing our export markets.
Thirdly: transportation is once again centre stage.
And if so, how?
That is something at least.
Many considerations arise.
Mrs Doyle said that it was a crisis.
Could I also ask what the EU is doing?
Has the veterinary advice been coordinated?
What do the European institutions think of wide-scale vaccinations?
A number of different issues were raised.
Foot-and-mouth disease is endemic in the developing world.
So do we wish to surrender the resulting benefits?
This is an important issue.
We must not lose sight of that.
The other route is the better one.
Intensive farming is another issue that was raised.
There farming is at its most intensive.
Transport was another issue that was raised.
I must stress this.
That is always the standard response when something happens.
The legislation is there.
Controls and enforcement are important.
We must not lose sight of that.
You have stood by your word.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
We will examine questions to the Council.
Question No 2 by (H-0141/01):
Mr President, I had the first question.
I hope that it does not happen again.
Question No 3 by (H-0229/01):
The Council's role is more complicated.
So a great deal is being done.
We are in complete agreement on this.
This is my counsel to the Council.
Question No 4 by (H-0145/01):
Should the nationality be stated, yes or no?
I think that I have been quite clear.
Question No 5 by (H-0147/01):
Question No 6 by (H-0156/01):
It is easier in certain areas.
Question No 7 by (H-0150/01):
Question No 8 by (H-0152/01):
What do you think?
Was the Commission' s reply wrong?
Perhaps you can advise me.
Mrs Kinnock has withdrawn Question No 9.
Question No 10 by (H-0159/01):
Has the Council no position at all on this?
And that is something I am still looking for.
Regulation of European securities markets (continuation)
I know it is appreciated by all my colleagues.
In short, we have a legislative problem.
I would agree with him in his sentiment.
As I have explained, they would.
I am afraid I cannot answer that question.
So I cannot comment on that.
The Commission wholeheartedly endorses that.
So it is not an intergovernmental committee.
Normally there is a government and a parliament.
That makes it more difficult.
Indeed there was a committee, the Lamfalussy committee.
That is a purpose I share.
There is no difference of opinion.
She want speedier legislation.
She is right.
That is the second point.
The Commission knows that.
That is the third point.
The Commission cannot and will not do so.
I cannot speak for the Council.
I refer to the callback right.
No one wants to change the Treaty just now.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
European economy
May I apologise on his behalf once again.
So much for the pros.
We also have a few demands.
Our citizens will finally hold it in their hands.
Growth and investment forecasts are being revised downwards everywhere.
We in the PPE-DE Group agreed with him unanimously.
But that is by the by.
The von Wogau report must be rejected.
Why?
Allow me to make three observations.
Here too, we lack initiatives.
This is patently a key point.
Structural reforms are regularly mentioned.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Swaps arrangements and forward rate agreements
Unfortunately it was not.
It also renders cooperation difficult.
Transparency is all we demand in Parliament.
We are not talking about deliberate, statistical lies.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
EU election assistance and observation
In what way?
A consistent political strategy is necessary.
Flexibility is definitely needed in the evaluation standards.
Moreover, strategy consists of rules and objectives.
A compulsory brief beforehand is therefore a minimum requirement.
Too often, observers arrive late and leave early.
Such missions will determine the nature of our observation.
The Commission is not interested in election tourism.
The visibility of European Union action is important.
Sustainability is important too.
Parliament's report deals with a hugely important subject.
Common strategy on Ukraine
Ukraine, however, is very different from Russia.
Ukraine is split internally.
Ukraine now clearly orientates itself towards Europe.
I would like to make one criticism, however.
Privatisation goes ahead slowly.
Our financial support should encompass the whole sector.
That is the good news.
That is a difficult, but not impossible task.
That is the bad news.
The report offers a strong foundation for that strategy.
Our group supports its main premises.
There are two ways of looking at this.
This on-going scandal is also affecting the European Union.
It has yet to ratify its accession.
We should expect Ukraine to take action.
Ukraine was not one of them.
What sort of concept do I mean?
Ukraine will soon be a neighbour of the EU.
This is a good report.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
We welcome that.
That means strengthening the rule of law.
It means making progress in the fight against corruption.
It means adopting market-oriented legislation.
Several Members have referred to the Gongadze case.
I was part of that troika delegation.
We are also ready to provide technical assistance.
The report has proposed enhanced attention to certain activities.
The point he makes is entirely valid.
I congratulate the honourable Member on his report.
I rather sympathise with his view.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
It gets to the heart of the matter.
But we should not do that.
Domain names have also proved to be valuable commodities.
This is a peculiar combination!
It is a strange game!
But we need something more.
Surely somebody must be responsible for something.
Did we have any representatives at the meeting?
How representative can ICANN be considered to be?
The same question was asked by Mr Paasilinna.
We therefore have good reason to be self-critical.
We need to work more quickly.
What does that word evoke?
He was Genoese, not Portuguese.
A few technical points have been addressed.
The Commission obviously cannot do everything on its own.
Thank you all once again!
Work of ACP/EU Assembly (2000)
The very structure of this Assembly is therefore unbalanced.
I have prepared this report twice.
We are now a parliamentary assembly.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
Life assurance
Lord Inglewood has taken soundings of the industry.
(Loud applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken today at noon.
Water management
on water management in Europe.
This sound ecological principle is enshrined in European law.
However, there are alternatives!
Israel provides a good example of this.
The directive does not prohibit water transfers per se.
Mr President, may I introduce a further thought?
Everyone would gain from that.
Municipalities and consumers would save on costs.
Producers would find new markets.
Would you like an example?
We strongly doubt that this reduction is a counter-proposal.
Ladies and gentlemen, the best reservoir is saving.
Let us do so.
The prospects in this sector are tremendous.
We must stop that before it happens.
I never said anything else, Mrs Sornosa.
That cannot be what such liberalisation is all about.
It is something we surely do not want.
The debate is closed.
Biotechnology industry
Mr President, we live in exciting times.
Biotechnology is yet another of these industries.
We ignore or side-step it at our peril.
This is for later, after proper debate.
Our scientists and entrepreneurs are watching intently.
Biotechnology could have immense importance for regional policy.
It will be very important to guarantee competition.
There must also be public control of the research.
This arrangement was a problem from the start.
There is room for improvement there.
But it is not all about growth.
We call it Bio-Science-North.
The IT stock market bubble has now burst.
Industry only maximises the value of shares.
Information on biotechnology should also reflect an even-handed balance.
However, the latter has only an advisory function.
Politicians remain responsible for the decisions.
Economic motives must not dominate moral considerations.
I think it is a good report.
Such things exist.
We could imitate it.
It would transform our energy industry completely.
That is Cuba.
That is also something we need to understand.
Biotechnology offers great opportunities, but also considerable risks.
We live in a democracy.
What have we seen in that time?
It is a question of distribution.
/NGL).
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I would like to make just two points.
The first relates to drug patenting.
My second point relates to patents on genetic discoveries.
Mr Purvis quite rightly emphasises all these developments.
Balanced regulation is important.
Genetic engineering applications will play a key role.
I would like to thank Mr Purvis sincerely.
The advantages are tangible and easy to understand.
We must also show the red card to extremists.
They must be allowed to change to green.
The Commission supports the basic thrust of the report.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I agree with you wholeheartedly, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
Now I know who was responsible for the leaks.
Mr Galeote has just told us.
VOTE
We shall look into this.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Kauppi Report (A5-0071/2001)
Inglewood Report (A5-0072/2001)
Why do they have to pay tax?'
Stockholm European Council
We are trying to deny the obvious!
That is what it is all about.
First and foremost, jobs is our top priority.
That is missing from our resolution.
Conflict prevention
Property values
von Wogau Report (A5-0082/2001)
'Well done, Mr von Wogau.
You have hit the nail on the head!'
I have therefore voted against the report.
We are voting against it.
Fava Report (A5-0060/2001)
This is not true democracy.
We find this competition for media attention highly inappropriate.
A European stopover there would probably be instructive.
VÃ¤yrynen Report (A5-0083/2001)
That is why I voted against this report.
Things have not improved since then.
I would like to discuss three aspects.
But politics is always tied up with interests.
The OSCE would be the appropriate framework for this.
Carraro Report (A5-0063/2001)
Martinez-Martinez Report (A5-0057/2001)
Purvis Report (A5-0080/2001)
There must be clear rules about this.
The principle of case-by-case assessment must apply for agriculture.
Organic producers assure me that they refute this statement.
I therefore reject this report.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Access to medicaments for AIDS patients in the third world
Only these factors will guarantee long-term development.
This resolution refers to a greatly impoverished Africa.
This applies to India in particular.
AIDS drugs constitute only a fraction of sales.
Then you have the access to medication.
Of course price is important.
The pharmaceutical companies have brought their prices down.
We are getting too emotional about this.
For that reason I wholeheartedly support the resolution.
In addition, simple things like refrigerators are needed.
But that is still not enough.
Mr President, our Group fully supports the proposal.
Afghanistan
But we in Europe know better.
It signified something else entirely.
I think the contrary is true.
I can name three.
That is an absolute basic.
We cannot keep hiding behind alibis.
The protest was vociferous.
It is perhaps the inverse representation of the symbol.
Let me explain what I mean by deprivation.
Discrimination is a natural corollary of exclusion.
This is called rejection.
These are the words we must use.
Who is protecting the Taliban?
Who is supporting them?
Pakistan.
Who is protecting them?
Do I have to answer?
Can you answer with me?
Why did we go to fight against Saddam Hussein?
Why have we imposed sanctions against Iraq?
Why do we not take sanctions against Afghanistan?
It is like living in the Middle Ages.
Commissioner, the European Union must act here.
My third point relates to Islam.
We must arrange a meeting.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
Situation in Zimbabwe
They told me that Zimbabwe is going through hell.
Our message is clear.
I commend the resolution unamended to the House.
We are supposed to have one standard for all.
But is that the way we react?
No!
We need to do something about it.
What is clear is that Zimbabwe is in chaos.
Human rights there are being trampled underfoot.
No.
This is an important element.
He was an active member of the MDC.
Children abducted by one of their parents
This is therefore something we need to work on.
This is the primary aim of this resolution.
It is not a one-way process.
This is unacceptable.
This is totally unacceptable.
I shall not do this!
We call once again for this to be done.
Situation in Kalimantan
The riots in Kalimantan are no exception.
Military intervention is not the answer.
Mr President, the violence in Indonesia is unremitting.
Indonesia is massive in geography and population.
It is the world's largest Muslim country.
I was there two weeks ago.
Situation in Turkmenistan
Quite the reverse, in fact!
Mr President, I shall start with Zimbabwe.
Sanctions are not considered appropriate at this stage.
The Commission fully supports Parliament's resolutions.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Uncontrolled trade in light weapons
In 1972, we banned biological weapons.
More than half of victims are in Africa.
I will not say any more.
We must support it.
The first is in the recitals.
The UN Conference is therefore more overdue than premature.
First of all, it is not legally binding.
Half of all American families possess a firearm.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Disasters
Floods in Mozambique
The country is facing a very worrying situation.
Europe should lead the way in this respect.
That country should not have to repay its debts.
Humanitarian disaster in Mongolia
Livestock is Mongolia' s chief resource.
Mongolia needs USD eight million.
I will be much obliged to you.
The European Union thus owes Mongolia something.
The evolution of the situation is being closely monitored.
I now give the floor to Mr Maat.
The Commissioner has not commented on this at all.
I am here the whole evening.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended until 5.30 p.m.)
Assistants' statute
Indeed it obliges us to do so.
I welcome this decision.
This solution appears both realistic and reasonable.
At least that is what the European Parliament hopes.
This realistic solution is also reasonable.
It does not wish to tackle tax issues.
Fine!
The way forward depends on the normal legislative process.
Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament.
Thank you.
We look forward to them.
First, it must be simple.
Second, it must provide the legal certainty.
This need not mean rigidity and uniformity.
Third, it must be transparent.
Mr President, thank you.
You have given us some good news.
The pace is to be speeded up.
We can all rejoice at that.
What is the current state of play?
We complied.
So, here we are.
Parliament has done its bit.
What can be done?
Give us a legal basis.
We need you to take this decisive step.
Our fellow Members have said so.
I welcome this.
Indeed, we must repudiate discrimination at all times.
Mr President, Commissioner, everything has been said.
We have done that.
You have pledged to do this.
The essential stage is always the next one.
I thank Parliament for this very clear message.
Mr Posselt on the rules of procedure.
It was uncommonly difficult to accommodate everyone.
We had to disappoint a large number of colleagues.
We actually walk in.
That is even healthier!
VOTE
Before the vote on Kalimantan:
Before the vote on light weapons:
It was purely and simply omitted.
(Parliament had no objections to the oral amendments)
President.
That concludes our agenda for this week.
I wish you all a safe journey home.
The France' s borders are closed!
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting closed at 6.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Agenda
Relating to Thursday:
President.
(Parliament gave its assent)
President.
However, we should not generalise.
This was not the Holy See' s policy.
I believe Parliament should make a statement on this.
(Parliament rejected the request)
This also applies to the Council.
Thank you, Mr van Velzen.
I shall check this with Mr Imbeni.
The order of business is thus adopted.
Speeches on procedure
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr Krivine.
Is this the punishment for resistance?
(Loud applause)
Furthermore, Parliament was not consulted on this subject.
I am very much looking forward to that.
Why do you only talk to government officials?
Investment services
The Commission communication is not a legislative text.
In Europe we have many more than one.
The regulations need to be adjusted accordingly.
This is very much under way in FESCO.
This may lead to rules that overlap.
We should have a country-of-origin approach underlying this directive.
The Commission has been far too tentative in enforcement.
They reflect a very large measure of agreement.
The Commission believes that the judgment must be mitigated.
These are not adequately addressed by the current ISD.
The Commission agrees with that view.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Cosmetic products
And is it?
Is this true?
No, it is not.
I would never want this.
Yes, there should be a test ban.
This is unacceptable.
So they have to be labelled.
I invite them to do so here and now.
I agree entirely with the rapporteur.
If they can, then change is needed.
This will actually encourage more animal testing.
Nevertheless, this subject is not unimportant.
Animal experimentation is an entirely different matter.
In my opinion, these also cover cosmetics.
I therefore back Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report.
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt put it concisely.
It is not even the status quo.
It is not.
Those who deferred our hopes should listen now.
I have certainly benefited from discussions with them.
That is not the case at all.
That is why a marketing ban is also needed.
There was also a very good debate in committee.
It is rather embarrassing.
What on earth will we do then?
We will be even more scared.
Any scientist will admit that this is true.
We cannot know about the WTO.
It is right that we hold the line.
This report is well worked out in its detail.
I commend the Roth-Behrendt report to you.
To achieve an alternative takes up to ten years.
I fear the answer to both questions is no.
We have to keep the pressure on.
.
Let me do so.
We have already discussed this in committee.
He refuted a deadly argument.
You are right!
We support all the important parts of the report.
We therefore support a comprehensive ban on these tests.
We also support the other parts of the report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Environmental issues of PVC
I would like to make this quite clear.
Allow me to list a few of these additives.
There are the plasticisers to start with.
The second additive is cadmium.
Cadmium is being phased out.
The case of lead is quite different.
This brings me to production and incineration in general.
This should therefore be closely monitored.
We therefore need a proper investigation into the matter.
For this we shall need legislation at European level.
We find this hard to grasp.
This might well be the case.
Blood transfusion bags are often cited in this connection.
Politicians need not judge these benefits.
What measures will we be taking?
The precautionary principle requires us to do this.
This call did not just come from environmentalists.
Whose interests come first?
Chlorine is one of its main components.
What ought to be done, then?
The issue of voluntary agreements arises in this connection.
We have therefore tabled only a few amendments.
PVC is a very important material in our society.
The same applies to phthalates in my view.
The use of lead is also becoming less common.
There are certainly alternatives.
We need to remind ourselves of the risks.
We should not be taken in by this.
In particular, window frames have been mentioned.
We must certainly try to recycle more PVC.
We are looking at a 60-year life cycle.
Much of the Sacconi report I entirely endorse.
It must be a wide-ranging and broad-based debate.
This has been quite perceptible here today.
After all, we need laws to achieve something.
It was attended by representatives from all interest groups.
There was a huge number of responses.
Pension schemes and funds
I agree with Mrs Randzio-Plath on her first question.
It must be supplemented by further initiatives.
I now turn to the issue of taxation.
So when is it going to arrive?
You are therefore required to table something.
He mentioned social aspects and so on.
He gave the English translation of that saying.
Lastly, I have not yet addressed Mr Huhne.
We have already had a discussion.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.38 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(Applause from the left)
Thank you, Mr Seguro.
So that is the end of this item.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Decision on urgent procedure
That will please Commissioner Schreyer.
(Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure)
2002 budget guidelines/ Financial perspective
Section I - European Parliament
Section II - Council
Section IV - Court of Justice
Section V - Court of Auditors
Section VI - Economic and Social Committee
Section VII - Committee of the Regions
Section VIII - Ombudsman;
BSE and foot-and-mouth disease have raised many issues.
We must start discussing this issue before 15 September.
This phenomenon calls for a multidisciplinary approach.
Let us find the courage to fight on.
I would like to start with enlargement.
The financial perspective must therefore reflect these extra needs.
Another major point is efficiency.
They will need to play an exemplary role.
We need to develop mobility plans.
We hope to set a good example.
This budget has experienced strong growth.
That is an objectionable development.
, rapporteur.
Why?
That is why we are concerned.
Our differences so far relate to two chapters.
The other institutions do not agree.
This will not be the central issue.
The question of principle is the profile of spending.
(Applause from the right)
This is also evident from its absence today.
Otherwise, I accept the guidelines and support them.
This applies to the structural indicators, for example.
We are reacting here to the Lamfalussy report.
(Applause)
My second point relates to energy.
That is free.
It does not cost anything.
It is certainly important to make these distinctions here.
That is the be-all and end-all for our farmers.
This is not acceptable.
That is just not on.
It does not have an impact on the budget.
That is simply a matter of fact.
We are also discussing the financial perspective.
We are also taking about inflating administrative budgets.
The Council now wants an additional EUR 10 million.
We are dealing with tax revenue.
We must make absolutely sure to involve everyone.
That should be an important priority for us.
One particular problem is the agricultural budget.
Crisis management is clearly a matter of operational expenditure.
We must utilise these appropriations.
But this is not just about more money.
Mr Virrankoski also highlighted this problem.
We know what that means.
A word to the wise, however.
But what a surprise.
I cannot quite follow this line of thought.
Programmes which are not effective must be abandoned.
They are responsible for their own revenue.
These are essentially national responsibilities, national budgets.
We should investigate that more.
I wish to comment on several items.
These are essential.
We need to resolve this between the three institutions.
This is something that must be addressed.
That really is putting the cart before the horse.
Consumers remain confused and bewildered.
Hence the worrying decline in meat consumption.
This is extremely important.
It is still there.
That point is worth emphasising.
Allow me to begin with the fisheries sector.
There is hardly any room in the fisheries budget.
And why do we support this objective?
That is the number one priority.
I want to be both controversial and constructive.
We should be looking ahead.
As we have heard, this is the intention.
But why not take advantage of that straight away?
They are mainly the ones hit by foot-and-mouth.
We cannot compromise on environmental standards in those areas.
Please get this sorted out.
It is time to break the deadlock.
I hope the Commission has heard what we say.
.
That is certainly not chicken feed.
These are still on the Council's table.
I think that is good news for all consumers.
EUR 6.15 billion are involved here.
Mr Colom i Naval made some observations about this.
Firstly, the problem of illegal immigration.
Many people are brought here by gangs of traffickers.
Secondly, there is the area of e-learning.
We should not forget that.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Mrs Haug has the floor.
.
So that is the legal position.
So far, so good.
We therefore also fully recommend the second amendment.
In Berlin there was a lengthy dispute regarding contributions.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Discharges
and
and
Can you give me a name?
Thank you.
I am not going to criticise the Council.
It will explain its reasons at the appropriate moment.
We take good note of its absence.
Mr President, thank you for your trouble.
Your words will appear in the Minutes.
Mrs Stauner has the floor.
I think these figures speak for themselves.
Please take that opportunity here today.
Has the Commission lived up to expectations, then?
Maybe not quite yet.
I believe that would be a very big mistake.
I think that this is what most MEPs want.
The new Commission has initiated large-scale reform.
In 1999, things were simply a mess.
We must hope that the reforms will remedy this.
We have received a lot of information this year.
However, I think it should be revised.
It will never be discovered.
Some of us can surely confirm this.
The Committee saw all 12 Commissioners.
That is something I do not agree with.
Parliament should not be a detective agency.
We should concentrate on structural problems.
Agricultural policy is a good example.
The Commission has fought hard to reform agricultural policy.
They rejected my request.
I can be brief about the committees and agencies.
How do they impact on legislation?
Do they operate efficiently?
The Commission has been responsible for the ECSC.
There is probably no lack of subjects for research.
The information is not now available.
The Commissioner has some difficult tasks before him.
The administrative structures are inappropriate and understaffed.
Thank you very much, Mrs RÃ¼hle.

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Women must choose between make-up and consideration for animals.
It is nothing to laugh about.
We should not be making jokes about these issues.
This is an extremely important issue.
There is a lot of hypocrisy in this House.
They are completely unnecessary.
They also expose babies to unnecessary risks.
It is extremely serious.
We really should take account of animal welfare.
The United Kingdom has already banned animal testing.
Some of its leading practitioners already have.
Haug report (A5-0101/2001):
Katiforis report (A5-0106/2001):
Kauppi report (A5-0105/2001):
Sacconi report (A5-0092/2001):
Why am I sad?
Allow me to quote a few examples.
The claims made here are therefore nonsense.
The negative effects are not apparent until afterwards.
Chlorine and dioxins are released during incineration.
Costa Neves report (A5-0102/2001):
Firstly, agriculture.
How can we reconcile these two requirements?
Secondly, enlargement.
The third area is the Treaty of Nice.
Yet, this is missing.
Buitenweg report (A5-0103/2001):
Many other small businesses are in the same situation.
What about the others though?
Discharges (continuation)
, Commission.
This was hard work for everyone concerned.
The audit findings here are also very important.
The primary duty of control falls to them.
We must learn from our mistakes.
Parliament investigated this case very thoroughly.
Many of the arrangements have changed since 1994.
In case of doubt the Commission must decide.
The short answer is "No!"
That is our criticism of this budgetary procedure.
There has been restructuring within the new Commission.
We shall ensure that this happens.
.
This is a theme continued from the past.
We want more spending on SYNERGY.
This causes real problems for those organisations.
This is a trend we desperately need to reverse.
Is this a discharge issue?
I defy anyone to disagree with that.
1999 - what a year that was.
The error rate quite simply did not improve.
What conclusions should we draw from this?
You simply will not.
Firstly, things have improved.
The Commission has taken us seriously.
This Parliament will be voting on this on Thursday.
I hope I can congratulate him on that tomorrow.
I would like to make a few general points.
That is very positive.
We all know the system of milk quota.
Is this not a case of distortion of competition?
Should the Commission not do something about this promptly?
There are still many ambiguities surrounding flax.
This will probably not only affect Spain.
No.
This is shoddy work and cannot be taken seriously.
The situation in 1999 was different.
These have been spoken of with unwarranted sensitivity.
That is, of course, not the case.
Interpreting these facts is a great deal harder.
Unfortunately, my confidence has taken a proportionate dive.
Personally speaking, I welcome all of the above.
That does not always happen.
Let's take the example of adulterated butter.
Or let us take the case of flax.
At first, this focussed solely on Spain.
This case was approached extremely tentatively.
I can understand that.
What are these issues?
Let me sum them up in four key phrases.
The first is the FlÃ©chard case.
I am gratified to hear it.
My second key phrase is the Statement of Assurance.
No, we want tangible results.
The DAS must be positive by 2002.
The third key phrase is access to information.
The previous speakers have also raised this issue.
Mr Folias' report is considered and coherent.
It contains no proposed amendments.
A word to the Commission.
You are absolutely right on this point.
Then he should come.
I have approached this report via the flax issue.
But we are in danger of overplaying our hand.
It looks at the way money is spent.
We have an entirely different responsibility.
I will start off with the Scandinavian countries.
We shall never discover more than we know now.
And what did we learn?
Thank you very much.
I am referring to the SYNERGY Programme.
Of course, the individual factors are also important.
We have just been talking about the blacklist.
Yes, we know about this.
So we will keep this issue alive.
That goes without saying.
Mr Blak's report makes this very clear.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Foot-and-mouth disease
There is a consensus on this objective.
We are acting urgently on all new information.
We are acting with as much transparency as possible.
These restrictions are adapted as circumstances change.
But the reality is far different.
Let me now repeat them.
Vaccination is not as simple as some suggest.
That clear message should go out from this Parliament.
There is no threat to human health.
What are the effects on markets in Europe?
This message must be driven home.
This should not be a temporary but permanent measure.
The Commissioner talked about the transport policy in Europe.
That is another question.
But they do not export the disease.
Vaccination is not just an emotive issue ....
Beef consumption has decreased by 50 per cent.
Even relatives are staying at home.
After all, cattle cannot be produced overnight.
Our exports are paralysed by poorly targeted embargoes.
What did the negotiations achieve?
What we should do is vaccinate.
So, what do we do?
We do not vaccinate.
And so the disease spreads further.
And what is the outcome of all this?
All of this happened by chance, of course.
What will need to be done?
We must also take a regionalist approach.
(Applause from the right)
The industry is destabilised and under threat.
Commissioner, this is an exceptional situation.
We must deal with it in an exceptional manner.
I hope it is.
We therefore have to look to the future.
I think these should be abolished altogether.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The present epidemic is anything but restricted.
It dithered whether to use incineration instead of burial.
Now it is dithering over vaccination.
They have nevertheless had six outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease.
During that time they can spread the virus.
I take an entirely different view.
Every live transport must be granted an exemption.
Why can animals not be transported after slaughter?
Try it and see.
Please be so kind, take the measures today.
Commissioner, thank you for your contribution.
People in my country no longer accept this.
Commissioner Byrne' s attitude is brutally inadequate.
Instead, he did nothing.
Ministers KÃ¼nast and Brinkhorst took the initiative instead.
Export interests are not sacrosanct.
I would like to make three brief points.
The second point relates to the agricultural sector.
Thirdly, we need flexible policies.
I am quoting animal welfare in this connection.
I am also quoting animals in zoos.
Furthermore, you are calling the effectiveness into question.
Commissioner, the situation is very serious indeed.
We call for a joint approach.
It is being asked for today in this House.
A decision on vaccination is not easy.
It is costing far more in lost business.
I would ask the Commissioner three questions.
That is what this crisis of foot-and-mouth disease signifies.
This illogical approach is intolerable.
This is unacceptable.
You must tell us what you think about vaccination.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt is right.
We should do this today, and not tomorrow.
Then there is the aspect of animal welfare.
All these aspects should therefore be considered.
The positions are shifting.
We applaud them for what they did.
We have suffered greatly from that.
The survival of a profession is at stake.
I said this last month.
It is for politicians to make these balanced choices.
Could this outbreak have been prevented?
Will consumers lose confidence in our food?
There will be more time for those later.
I am referring specifically to firebreak vaccination.
What about Europe's moral responsibility for its policies?
Thank you.
If I do please forgive me for that.
The Commission does see a role for vaccination.
The original outbreak in the UK was in pigs.
They would still have cross-contaminated the sheep.
We do not have that yet.
I agree fully with that point.
Let me deal with some of the individual questions.
They are not precedents for anything either.
Trade was allowed from the free areas.
It is in every respect quite a different issue.
The questioner said he had major doubts about this.
But it does require ring-fencing.
We were told on Tuesday night.
The Commission did act very quickly on this issue.
That is not so.
I have met the farming unions.
This in fact was an illegal activity.
It is something that consideration should be given to.
I was asked why zoos are being closed.
Mrs Lucas made reference to the National Farmers Union.
That is the point I was making earlier.
Is it to be generalised?
Is it to be localised?
How localised?
What area?
On what basis?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that what you are saying?
Do you want more?
It is not quite so simple.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much, Mr BÃ¶ge.
President.
After all, it was scheduled for 6 p.m.
Commissioner Solbes has the floor.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Do you plan to launch a specific initiative here?
We still have a few months left.
That is better than simply binning them.
Are you working with their national banks?
Should they perhaps operate as issuing offices as well?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
This item is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
We will examine questions to the Commission.
Part one
Question No 29 by (H-0263/01):
Question No 30 by (H-0300/01):
The operations funded focus mostly on basic health care.
.
They are not our own figures.
Question No 31 by (H-0260/01):
How many studies have been conducted in this area?
.
Question No 32 by (H-0281/01):
Second part
Questions to Commissioner Busquin
What part does intellectual property play in this matter?
We have clearly stated our own interpretation.
Question No 33 by (H-0279/01):
Question No 34 by (H-0287/01):
Questions to Commissioner Vitorino
Thank you very much, Mr Busquin.
Question No 35 by (H-0266/01):
Question No 36 by (H-0276/01):
I would thank the Commissioner for his answer.
Is that correct?
Have I understood correctly?
Question No 37 by (H-0311/01):
Thank you, Commissioner.
Question No 38 by (H-0320/01):
Questions to Commissioner Patten
Its operating budget will also be set.
Yes, I wholeheartedly agree with you.
I certainly recall the European Parliament' s proposal.
Question No 39 by (H-0249/01):
The European Union very much welcomes that agreement.
My latest trip to Skopje was yesterday.
It was his third trip in that period.
We had individual meetings with all the party leaders.
All of them expressed their commitment to democracy.
All of them expressed their commitment to dialogue.
That is the path to Europe.
But I want to go further.
There are, in political terms, figuratively several.
They are committing more troops.
They are making a greater effort.
Question No 41 by (H-0274/01):
More than 28 women having been executed since 1990.
Question No 42 by (H-0277/01):
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
People with disabilities
It also gives me grounds for hope.
The fourth perspective is that of consultation and information.
That is what we are aiming to achieve.
We must look at all the issues.
People with disabilities are discriminated against today.
There is clear discrimination in this area.
The same applies to the labour market.
Unemployment among people with disabilities is very high.
Disability is not a static phenomenon.
We can implement changes.
I myself come from the world of education.
Professional integration is therefore associated with social integration.
I can only see two shortcomings.
They are the true disabled in this European society.
It is no easy task.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Public health action programme (2001-2006)
Our health systems are usually gender-blind.
National reports rarely include a breakdown by gender.
In Germany, the figure is 70%.
It affects one woman in nine.
So here too, best practice is imperative.
Here, I support the rapporteur's proposed amendment.
In this respect we face some very demanding challenges.
We think this is essential.
He is fully correct in his approach.
In conclusion, health connects with the citizen.
We must deliver on health and well-being.
First, the scope and structure of the programme.
These are matters for the Member States.
Therefore, this amendment is acceptable only in part.
Therefore the Commission can accept these amendments.
Therefore I can only accept it in part.
Many of the amendments will improve this proposal.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Golden shares
All interpretation based on economic criteria should be excluded.
Firstly, the problem of Community legislation.
We are discussing one of these communications today.
But there is a substantial danger here.
However, one can always seek improvements.
I am speaking on behalf of the Italian radicals.
This is the root of the matter.
I cannot see it that way.
The source of law is the Treaty.
The Treaty is clear.
It did not do so without reason.
I shall refer to two particular instances.
The Commission took energetic action.
The United Kingdom changed its policy.
The second instance is a more recent one.
That is the reason for the interpretative communication.
That is the responsibility of the Court of Justice.
That is what the Commission has done.
I was asked if I would issue a directive.
There is no need for a directive.
We have a treaty.
So we do not need a directive.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.15 p.m.)
I shall do as you have just suggested.
Statement by the President
There was also a brief discussion of agricultural policy.
I will begin by commenting on the Lisbon Process.
Secondly: biotechnology.
In Lisbon the emphasis was on information technology.
Our discussions must address these too.
This will have to take place gradually.
Our focus is full employment and active welfare states.
We will also start a new WTO round.
This is important.
Discriminatory pay differences are to be combated.
The quality of workplaces must also be developed.
We will return to this in Gothenburg.
This is our vision.
Alongside the Lisbon Process we discussed foreign relations.
This primarily concerned four issues.
Firstly, our relations with Russia.
We will give Russia every support in this process.
This was addressed during the discussion with President Putin.
He was invited more as a gesture of solidarity.
This is part of a Balkan strategy.
The Middle East is our neighbour.
In that sense peace and security cannot be separated.
We addressed issues concerning people in their day-to-day lives.
(Applause)
Secondly, the Galileo programme.
Thirdly, the financial markets.
Fourthly, the Community patent.
I sincerely hope that this situation can be resolved.
Fifthly, the single European sky.
Sixthly, postal services.
(Applause)
That is a good sign.
I hope that future presidencies will follow your example.
Please do something in this regard.
A little more modesty would do us good.
It is a partnership of negation and blockade!
That is not how we see the Franco-German partnership.
(Applause)
On the contrary, you prefer intergovernmental collaboration.
We get blockades.
(Applause)
(Applause)
But that is not the point right now.
That brings me to my final point.
We criticise this as emphatically as we know how.
But burden sharing also applies to environmental protection.
Burden sharing also applies to environmental policy.
(Applause)
I wish this success on both you and us.
(Applause)
I congratulate him on this agreement.
That is something which must be changed.
That is the only way to peace.
Our future depends on it too.
Just to go to Chechnya, nothing more.
Commissioner Nielson made no response.
What is currently happening in Chechnya is an outrage.
We must make political investments, Mr President-in-Office.
In Stockholm, the brakes were applied.
My second question concerns enlargement.
Will you succeed with your goals?
Help us to secure them.
This is the view taken by many fellow MEPs.
We have already mentioned Macedonia.
We do not exert enough pressure to obtain peace.
The second is about reducing the number of unemployed.
These are two different areas of policy.
He is right.
The symbolism is crystal clear.
There was a great deal of tangible tension.
This brings me to my third point.
St Petersburg has been mentioned.
This is a crucial point for us.
Which brings me to my final point.
Reform of the EU is going too slowly.
This is an excellent ambition.
How will this ensure its sustainable development in future?
Sustainability is not just a domestic issue.
It is an international and inter-generational concept.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I have a second question.
Mr President-in-Office.
I will concentrate on the Lisbon Process.
It is important that we have achieved this.
All these ingredients were present at the Stockholm Summit.
What in fact does it mean politically?
Might it possibly be nothing but words?
In this sense the Stockholm Summit was a disappointment.
(The President cut the speaker off)
My second question concerns the following.
Let us remove the obstacles.
There is this draft framework directive.
My second point is method.
We are not entirely clear about these social situations.
This is a very important mandate in my view.
It is also a question of legislation.
This means that we were well-placed to achieve success.
This is based on consensus, unanimity.
This is what this is about.
This is far from unimportant.
Now, a few words on the Lisbon Process.
This is a very large and fundamental reorganisation.
It is far from simple.
It is no easy debate.
We can never ignore this.
We constantly have to maintain this balance.
Several speakers have mentioned enlargement of the Union.
I hope that we succeed.
This will be extremely important at the Gothenburg Council.
This is a scandal.
This is our great neighbour to the east.
(Loud applause from the right)
On post Parliament does not have a problem.
The Council does.
President.
I welcome the progress made thus far.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
VOTE
(Sustained applause)
(Parliament adopted the proposal)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
Is the Bureau aware of this or not?
This new demand is therefore somewhat beyond me.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
, rapporteur.
(EL) Mr President, I quite agree.
(Parliament adopted the decision)
Section IV - Court of Justice
Section V - Court of Auditors
Section VI - Part B, Committee of the Regions
Section VI - Part A, Economic and Social Committee
I am the rapporteur for all amendments.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Trakatellis report (A5-0104/2001)
I look forward to the second reading.
I saw Mrs Trakatellis as if in a dream.
Congratulations Mrs Trakatellis!
We have therefore voted against the report.
This is not the case, however.
Stauner report (A5-0112/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
Why is that?
Blak report (A5-0113/001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
Why is that?
But to do what?
And how?
I do not share his view on this.
van der Laan report (A5-0108/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
I do not support them.
SeppÃ¤nen report (A5-0097/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
RÃ¼hle report (A5-0109/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
Who were these giants?
Hermange report (A5-0084/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
It was only a dream, Mr President!
Conservatives in the UK have voted in favour.
This is another important fundamental change.
That concludes voting time.
It is unacceptable.
Europe is putting the cart before the horse.
So what exactly is the problem?
We must do the job properly now!
Tomorrow will be too late!
Fundamental questions and less than three months to go.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Area of freedom, security and justice
The next item is the joint debate on
and
The second issue is freedom.
Freedom is a product of justice.
Freedom is based on human dignity.
The Commission scoreboard here is exemplary.
This programme of measures is ambitious and wide-ranging.
On 11 December 2000 the Eurodac Regulation was adopted.
The question of family reunification is also important.
This is precisely what the Tampere Conclusions are about.
It is a historic challenge and an historic opportunity.
In this communication, we focused on two objectives.
Let us take pride in our European identity.
I shall start with the last point.
You have my support here, Commissioner.
(The President cut the speaker off)
But the citizens do not know.
Please do not just reaffirm the Tampere decisions again.
Tell us how you intend to move forward.
These are not national problems.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Words should now be followed by actions.
I have three remarks in connection with this question.
First of all, a comment on the semantics.
However, that is not the case.
Finally, I have a political remark to make.
That is something it is nowhere near doing.
These concerns also require European responses.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Our external borders are under great pressure.
Has the Council no practical solutions in this area?
Will crime and harsh reality decide?
They term it 'Fortress Europe' .
Is this freedom?
Mrs Klingvall, Mr BodstrÃ¶m!
Three women gave birth to children in these conditions.
It is intolerable.
Why does anyone leave their homeland?
Where are the refugees who willingly leave their homeland?
Why do we not all focus on this programme?
But why has this happened?
This work obviously has considerable dynamism.
This is a continuing and despicable trade.
It exploits people in vulnerable situations.
Humanitarian acts must not be punishable.
However, the sanctions must not be disproportionately severe.
They wondered: "What is actually happening?
I reported on some of the decisions taken.
Mr President, criminality is becoming increasingly international.
This is incorrect!
So we are not neglecting the drugs issue.
Let us all work together to that end.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 16 May.
UN conference on least-developed countries
The next item is the following two oral questions:
The Regulation became applicable on 5 March this year.
Preparations for this conference are underway.
We must also be clear.
This action programme will serve as an itinerary.
Good governance is a key issue in the LDCs.
This is absolutely wrong.
The aid budget must concentrate on the poorest.
That is what our citizens expect and require.
Their average life expectancy is 50 years.
Too many LDCs have totally unsustainable debt burdens.
Everything but arms represents significant progress.
This is absolutely unacceptable.
Trade concessions on their own are not sufficient.
Our fellow MEPs have illustrated this amply.
How coherent is our own policy?
Surely there is no reason for doing that!
We discovered these facts just now.
Production capacity has been reduced in some countries.
(The President cut the speaker off)
There are enough tasks to get to grips with.
These are already well defined.
Take the example of Angola.
Healthcare in the poorest countries is seriously underfunded.
We need tangible results.
The list has not been finalised.
Chile and New Zealand have displayed positive tendencies.
Such an impression is totally without foundation.
This general plan is now on the table.
You are aware of it.
It is available for you to read.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0248/01)
Question No 2 by (H-0259/01)
Question No 3 by (H-0306/01)
This support now amounts to nearly EUR 2 million.
I am here on behalf of Mr Papayannakis.
First of all, I asked a straightforward question.
And Mr Solana did the same.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Question No 4 by (H-0290/01):
Question no 5 by (H-0299/01):
In addition, we are offering technical expertise.
I wanted to ask the President-in-Office about Greece.
Question No 6 by (H-0251/01):
Allow me to mention two things.
The answer is that it has been solemnly proclaimed.
The Member requests repetition.
Question No 7 by (H-0252/01):
These people are hunters and marksmen travelling to competitions.
There are huge discrepancies in the rules here.
Do you intend to take any initiatives here?
No, we do not.
Question No 8 by (H-0253/01):
I do not know whether to laugh or cry.
That is what we do.
Question No 9 by (H-0257/01):
Question No 10 by (H-0264/01):
'1.
2.
Does the Council of Ministers share this view?
Question No 11 by (H-0265/01):
The question revolves around a very central issue.
I have little to add to my original answer.
Question No 12 by (H-0271/01):
Question No 13 by (H-0273/01):
More than 28 women having been executed since 1990.
Question No 14 by (H-0278/01):
I want to thank Mr Danielsson for that answer.
History has shown the danger of such a development.
Question No 15 by (H-0280/01):
Data from research vessels is constantly being assembled.
Question No 16 by (H-0286/01):
Question No 17 by (H-0288/01):
Question No 19 by (H-0294/01):
What is the Council's response to these conclusions?
Practical measures are being taken within the Community too.
What does the decision mean for the world community?
Air carrier liability in the event of accidents
These limits are now far too low.
I would like to highlight six points this evening.
These amendments can roughly be divided into three categories.
That is new.
However, various relevant articles were missing.
The lawyers in the court room will love this.
Nonetheless, it was a most interesting speech.
This position is complicated by two factors.
The Regulation was therefore held to be valid.
The Warsaw Convention is 70 years of age.
Those rights are negligible.
That is what we should be doing tonight.
We think that providing passengers with information is fundamental.
This is a good thing.
You understand what I mean, do you not?
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Coordination of transport by rail, road and inland waterway
This is its intention and we applaud it.
It has moved ahead, but rather too tentatively.
Trains can use a greater proportion of renewable energy.
Not at all.
.
Competitive neutrality can therefore be jeopardised.
He has drafted it very carefully.
We may, nonetheless, quote the European Council.
And that is precisely the objective here.
How can they be scientifically defined?
I am delighted that the report says as much.
He was most cooperative while drafting his report.
The previous speaker pointed this out.
Now to aid for use of the infrastructure.
This is possible pursuant to the amendments.
They do not belong here.
Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio himself has addressed this.
I shall refer to some of them.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Sea ports, inland ports and intermodal terminals
Then the Council took its time.
Nonetheless, I think the end is in sight.
These errors should not be repeated during the revision.
I think this was achieved very well.
And a third point, if I may.
What is Parliament here for?
for inland ports: 500 000 tonnes of freight.
I close by congratulating the rapporteur on his work.
Mr President, a very good evening to you.
I said all' s well that ends well.
That is now being put right.
It is a pity it has taken so long.
I conclude by again thanking the rapporteur.
Many thanks once again to the rapporteur.
Congratulations!
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
You have been here for ages.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Money laundering
We have an important item on our agenda today.
What are the core problems?
That was decided long ago.
One last point on the question of equal treatment.
In other words, it is a practicable proposal.
It is a simpler and more manageable proposal.
The Council has rejected fundamental proposals.
We shall have a conciliation procedure.
Criminal money could give liberalisation a bad name.
Turning to lawyers, they rightly get special treatment.
National sovereignty has to be suspended in this connection.
It will soon all be possible in euros.
Europe is only at the start of the process.
It is virgin territory waiting to be explored.
It is a basic question of culture and civilisation.
I fully support this extension.
Thirdly: the confidentiality of information received.
They should be covered.
Money laundering is linked to organised crime.
We know that.
I agree with Mrs SÃ¶rensen.
There are loopholes in this system.
We must do everything we can to counter them.
Nevertheless it also insists on this point.
I would like Members to keep that in mind.
Amendments Nos 15 and 16 deal with client identification.
I cannot.
The Commission could not accept this breach.
The Commission is currently preparing this proposal.
The Commission considers, therefore, these amendments unnecessary.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Community programmes/Judicial network
Mr President, I shall do my best.
So much for this aspect.
A detailed proposal on this has already been submitted.
I hope it will not disappoint.
It is a proposal on two levels.
This will be the golden era for international crime.
Our Group supports both reports submitted by Mrs KeÃler.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Support system for producers of arable crops
I want to emphasise this at this point.
The introduction of soya may pay off.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Mr Chairman, you have the floor.
It concerns personal statements.
I wanted to say that as a personal remark.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
Without further ado, I give you the floor.
(Applause)
But do we perceive ourselves as Europeans?
What speed limit must it keep to?
What traffic regulations apply to it?
How and where are the points set?
And where does the journey end?
These are not academic questions.
That is precisely what Europe is doing.
(Applause)
But surely this is just a semantic argument?
(Applause)
A federation meets all these requirements.
It should consist of three sections.
(Applause)
That must be the guideline.
I should just like to mention two examples here.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
(Loud applause)
(Laughter, applause)
(Loud applause)
(Loud applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I think it was exemplary.
(Applause)
We must involve all interested citizens.
(Applause)
You have already done so much.
Keep up the good work.
I am with you all the way!
(Long, loud standing ovation)
You have laid great stress on democratic legitimacy.
(Applause)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Animal feedingstuffs/Vegetable proteins
Commission statement on incentives for vegetable protein production.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has the floor.
This assessment was finally reaffirmed in its own proposal.
That was only to be expected from the Council.
A real lesson in political culture.
This is now our task.
We are on the right track.
Commission.
The Commission was happy to accept this invitation.
What were these findings?
I am convinced that Parliament will take this line.
Back, however, to the first issue.
You are smiling, Commissioner Fischler.
This too has our full support.
Just like people, animals need balanced nutrition.
How else can we restore consumer confidence in meat.
That also applies to feedingstuffs.
We have turned them into cannibals.
The BSE crisis poses new dilemmas.
All the more reason for abandoning these WTO rules.
Thank you, Mrs Schierhuber.
It is usually fraud.
But the legislation is present.
The US has strict measures and regulations on imports.
.
This is clearly not satisfactory.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Your clarification will be noted in the Minutes.
Do you wish to speak again, Mr Fischler?
Commission.
These are two separate issues.
This brings me back to the current protein deficit.
.
Once again let me make myself clear.
My view is that not enough preparation was made.
Am I right in thinking that it would?
Commission.
Our supply reduction measure is set aside.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Deadlock in negotiations on the EU/Morocco Fisheries Agreement
Mr Fischler has the floor.
Commission.
This also gives a price advantage for Morocco.
We all knew that it was difficult for you.
It was little more than that, however.
These are the key points.
It is not impossible to solve, however.
Why did the negotiations fail?
In your speech you talked again about another mandate.
Is another mandate possible?
These are questions that require answers.
I see three main routes here.
We are in a political assembly.
We are not market traders; we are politicians.
I personally shall not.
This question remains to be answered.
Commission.
Secondly, we must be clear about one thing.
I told the Minister as much.
You must bear one thing in mind, however.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Expenditure on CFP control, inspection and surveillance systems
, rapporteur.
Let me get straight to the point.
We need a global approach.
It lies with the Member States.
So an appropriate budget is of paramount importance.
Commission.
Now I will come to the amendments.
There is no problem with that.
And we can only take a decision afterwards.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I think the Quaestors should probably get involved too.
Mr President, there will be no debate.
All of us in this House must be united.
Thank you for that felicitous proposal, Mr Poettering.
Welcome

Piecyk Report (A5-0111/2001)
Lehne recommendation for second reading (A5-0090/2001)
So those amendments are unacceptable.
.
This is just not the case.
In this case, this may be justified.
Nonetheless, this sets an undesired precedent.
We must work together to tackle this challenge.
Graefe zu Baringdorf Report (A5-0079/2001)

We need traceability and we also need controls.
Sanders-ten Holte Report (A5-0093/2001)

Foot-and-mouth disease (RC B5-0303/2001)
Public opinion is doubtful, and it is right.
The answer is two-fold.
I find this financial reasoning absurd.
Surely exports could be accompanied by a vaccination certificate?
And why must absolutely everything be subordinated to exports?
Foot-and-mouth, though, is an ancient disease.
.
Farmers are bewildered and at their wits' end.
That is damaging to the whole Union.
Yet another summit serving private interests.
This time financial services emerge as the great victors.
The path has therefore already been mapped out.
This is what I too hope for.
Third UN Conference (B5-0246/2001)
However, we have reservations about paragraph 13.
(Commons Hansard Debates 18 January 2001)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Mr President, I am rather disappointed.
Parliament agrees about the situation in China.
Europe cannot remain silent and watch this happen.
But we did not get that far.
We need a sound human rights policy to match.
That is why this resolution is so pertinent.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Kyoto Conference objectives
on the Kyoto Conference objectives.
Their hand in this boycott is obvious.
More than 20 countries have already done just that.
Worldwide negotiations have taken place for nearly ten years.
The time has come for action and deeds.
Windmills are Denmark' s second export product.
Citizens, show your anger and boycott Bush.
Boycott Exxon, Texaco and Chevron.
Kyoto is only the beginning of the way forward.
What is President Bush afraid of?
And developed countries and communities have a particular responsibility.
It is not jobs or the environment.
I wish to make four brief points.
That is literally a life-threatening development.
And now, to cap it all, Kyoto.
Commissioner, we must save the Kyoto Protocol.
The survival of the planet is at stake.
That is why we must set an example.
Public opinion supports us in this.
The poorest populations will be most affected.
And this is not necessarily the worst-case scenario.
All nations must assume their responsibilities.
We must reject any re-examination of the Kyoto commitments.
This must not happen.
What has happened is deeply tragic.
It is completely unacceptable.
Were they able to prevent Seveso?
The problem is very serious.
It is under development.
This is therefore an important date for us all.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
on the abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas in Cyprus.
on violence towards Catholic nuns.
on the situation in Pakistan.
on the rights of homosexuals in Namibia.
Abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas in Cyprus
SE).
The British police investigated the matter and they say:
But these are the words of the British police.
Commissioner, I turn to you.
I refuse to choose one side or the other.
Our interest is in a united European Cyprus.
It seems to have been an ill conceived tit-for-tat.
Violence towards Catholic nuns
Secondly, nuns have been harmed in various countries.
Is this social justice?
The Vatican opposes such measures.
This is no isolated incident.
We are united in solidarity with the victims.
However, we should not generalise.
It certainly does not deserve this misguided attack.
I voted against the proposal.
However, that is exactly what is happening.
This resolution is hypocritical and unacceptable.
We must not go down this path.
We must make it more difficult in this way.
Pakistan
Independent parties must be allowed to field candidates.
They must stop being exposed to constant pressure.
We are obliged to do this.
Commissioner, we hope we will succeed.
Active party members of the opposition are being apprehended.
Pakistan is becoming increasingly isolated on the world stage.
The population must be freed from this.
It deserves sunnier prospects.
Rights of homosexuals in Namibia
End of quote.
A good example is South Africa.
Homosexual rights are human rights.
This is the year 2001.
His henchmen will take care of the rest.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy.
We naturally also discuss many European issues.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in Mexico
on the situation in Mexico.
This agreement opens the way for dialogue and understanding.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in Somalia and attack against "MÃ©decins sans frontiÃ¨res
What can be the cause of their complaints?
It is the people who are paying the price.
We must send an equally powerful message.
The warlords are those who now wield power.
The Arta peace talks brought renewed hope.
Thank you, Commissioner Lamy.
That is why we must have a 20-minute break.
Fishing accidents
We need to make safety a priority.
I will make his statement in English:
I would like to add a few personal comments.
I agree with all these statements.
This is not an empty rhetorical exercise.
Congratulations, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos.
The level of marine accidents is unacceptably high.
I therefore urge Members to support Amendment No 6.
I support this proposition.
Commission.
The Commission entirely agrees with you.
The Commission can agree with you fully.
Monitoring and control are the main problems.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Professional fees
But this is a very serious matter.
This is very much to be welcomed.
I have one final comment.
Most liberal professions are also small and medium-sized enterprises.
I have now spoken for six minutes.
I will forego my last minute.
Commission.
Justification on grounds of professional ethics is not recognised.
Let me give you two UK-based examples.
First, price: should this be regulated?
I experienced this myself the other week.
I had to renew the lease of my office.
I was bound to use my landlord's solicitors.
They need to be challenged.
Commission.
In fact the first rule dates back to 1993.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 6.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Agenda
Relating to Wednesday 2 May:
Is that a correct interpretation of Rule 6?
Yes, Mr Wurtz, you are right.
(Applause from the left)
At that time, 17 prisoners had died.
A further 160 prisoners are in a critical condition.
(Applause from the left)
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.
I particularly wanted to mention that.
(Applause)
The positions in Turkey are clearly evident today.
We can find a solution in two days.
Relating to Thursday 3 May:
President.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Speeches relating to procedure
What is the current situation?
You have access to this document.
I think that you are aware of the situation.
Who are they trying to embarrass here?
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
The President made a discreet reference to the reason.
It is because her husband has died.
We offer her our sincere sympathy.
(Applause from the right)
That was a unanimous decision.
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
Thank you, Mrs Hautala.
There is no doubt about it.
We cannot continue to beat about the bush.
Madam President, thank you for your explanation.
This is important.
I did not wish to use these arguments.
Please do me the favour of answering the House.
(Applause from the left)
I am surprised at the tone of this debate.
We need to give it that time.
(Applause from the right)
That is very important.
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
The reason is quite obvious.
The situation in my country is very delicate.
The question is very complex.
The matter will then be perfectly clear.
I was not making a party political point.
Please be a little more patient!
You may even be slightly troubled by this.
That is what is unacceptable.
We must not accept it.
I defend what you have done.
Thank you, Mr Tajani.
We have reached the end of this debate.
The conviction was upheld last week.
The Belgian police refused to take that further evidence.
Thank you, Mrs Lynne.
Can you offer any advice in this situation?
Thank you, Mrs Scallon.
EU/UN partnership on development and humanitarian issues
This must result in better coordination and more coherence.
Nevertheless, it is an important contribution.
We have to move from projects to programmes.
We need:
Mr President, I welcome the statement.
It is the best quality support.
We are not contemplating core funding.
I saw a lot of time wasted this afternoon.
This is what we are aiming at.
How will this continue to be organised or coordinated?
Things are better now than they used to be.
I have already mentioned protection and security.
This is the self-confidence.
Mental health is the fastest growing cause of disability.
That is a disgrace to the world.
We can do more.
We are not asking for a new legal basis.
We are asking for a closer partnership.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
Request for the waiver of Peter Sichrovsky's immunity
I will develop this point in my forthcoming speeches.
Thank you very much for your understanding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Request for the waiver of Johannes Voggenhuber's immunity
This applies to Mr Sichrovsky in particular.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11a.m.
Request for the waiver of Elisabeth Jeggle's immunity
This case raises no such issue.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.a.m.
Public access to documents
, rapporteur.
It is by no means a step backwards.
The exceptions are therefore discretionary, not mandatory.
That was a key element for our Parliament.
Electronic mail also falls under this heading.
This is clearly stipulated in recital 16.
I should like to see it explained accordingly.
Is this Regulation now perfect?
I should first like to thank Mr Cashman.
This is a Russian wooden doll.
This is just how these rules work.
Secondly, new and better provisions are needed.
It is a proposal of its time.
There are still critics of the compromise.
How much control would the public have exercised then?
Fortunately, that is not the case.
That was not acceptable to us.
All in all, I am keeping it low-key.
The Court too has to accept this veto.
All we can do is vote for or against.
I too would have preferred a more far-reaching compromise.
Any necessary exceptions to this principle should be justified.
This has now been firmly established.
We shall see how this works in practice.
That can be covered in the revised version.
The answer is no.
My answer is an unqualified yes.
The answer is an unqualified yes.
That, if anything, surely constitutes progress.
All this does constitute substantial progress.
People want the institutions to be more open.
National rules are subordinate to an EU Regulation.
The conciliation ought to continue as normal.
That is good for consistency but bad for transparency.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That needs to be stressed here today.
We certainly will.
What does sensitivity mean?
We are all very sensitive.
How will you interpret sensitivity?
There is money available for that.
It is a step forwards in many ways.
Public scrutiny is not dangerous.
Rather, it is democratic and efficient.
But I am not thrilled with the end result.
The procedures are not particularly wonderful.
This is a reality which we must accept.
Let me be clear.
Otherwise, people will become even more mistrustful.
We have achieved a compromise and made certain gains.
It is interesting to see what was dispensed with.
Many images have been used today.
We have acquired a powerful tool.
We must respect the meaning of the words.
What we have here are marked improvements.
It also depends upon a culture of transparency.
We must see how the new rules work.
Such is life.
A decision for or against is then made.
Hardly any representatives from southern European countries have spoken.
Things move on.
This Union has moved on.
Post Nice, we have a security policy.
It is right that we operate properly and responsibly.
Thank you very much, Mr Cashman.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Welcome
EU/FYROM Agreement
.
Violence and terror tactics should not be rewarded.
That would not help anyone except the extremists themselves.
(Applause)
I could say exactly that.
This demonstrates whom Parliament has decided in favour of.
We need to fight together against criminality.
But they need jobs and they need prospects.
However, you must do your part.
So, we must continue to make good progress.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
You must admit that this is going too far.
At last, we have an agreement.
These frustrations are far-reaching.
So federalism cannot provide a solution?
Federalism does not necessarily bring division.
But there is more.
There are already negotiations under way with Croatia.
And we should not overlook Bosnia, of course.
That is a form of conflict prevention.
However, it is a fragile agreement.
Eight policemen and soldiers were killed the other day.
Provocation.
Only then can there be political stability.
It is a familiar tactic.
Thank you very much, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Nuclear safety fifteen years after Chernobyl
Nuclear safety is a priority for the European Union.
The case of the Russian Federation is particularly important.
It is not.
That alone contributes to safety.
A democracy has independent supervisory agencies.
That too contributes to safety.
We want help for the Ukraine.
The Commission has a debt to discharge here.
Is the precautionary principle being applied today?
Food from the polluted area remains unsuitable for consumption.
Meaning that they will die.
But we must have a minimum consensus.
We shall soon have a common currency - wonderful.
We also hear talk of standard shapes for cucumbers.
So why no minimum consensus here?
The situation in Belarus is possibly worse still.
NGOs carry out their work under difficult conditions.
We can understand that.
Victims, human lives are being lost to cancer.
For example, what has been said about Kozlodoui?
And why?
Because there are financial considerations.
Well, let us deal with the financial considerations.
The reactors may even be sold to private individuals.
The financial problem is secondary.
We must have sustainable energy policies.
Nuclear power is no solution.
It is not clean and it is not cheap.
I have been asked what standards are applied.
What does that mean?
That is incredibly important, I believe.
Thank you for the debate.
Thank you very much, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Protection of euro against counterfeiting
Otherwise, this will not work.
It is about nothing other than political leadership.
Thank you, Mr President.
It may have been designed to do exactly that.
We must also fight against swindling and confidence tricks.
Congratulations, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld!
My concerns are twofold, however.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Illegal substances - Synthetic drugs
I. on the transmission of samples of illegal narcotic substances
It is not perfect in every respect.
I know that.
I completely share that view.
That would be deeply regrettable.
These are the latest figures available.
Drugs cause harm when they are abused.
But that is exactly where the problem lies.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
Not a lot has happened since in one sense.
It is not.
I do not mind underpinning the market.
That could be part of it.
Congratulations to all concerned.
The situation requires a certain humility on our part.
All of this is of crucial importance.
That is a deciding factor.
Measures are needed and are no luxury.
Let there be no mistake about this.
It stands for passing the blame and dodging responsibility.
The Regulation takes account of scientific development.
The rapporteur is proposing two amendments.
Consumer confidence dropped to a record low.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Movement of pets
Examples include aggressive forms of distemper.
Completely to omit ferrets is irresponsible.
We have to be a little more lenient there.
Finally, ferrets.
I would happy to go along with that.
I am sure the Commission has too.
I would not like the job myself.
Remember it is 8 years down the line.
Tattoos, however, are much less satisfactory.
Finally, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 14.
Therefore I can accept this amendment.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Veterinary medicinal products
But major species have also been affected.
There are many different perspectives to be reconciled.
Unfortunately, no satisfactory solution has yet been found.
This legislation is currently being reviewed.
Obviously, these legislative changes will take some time.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
That is indeed the case, Mr Wurtz.
Thank you very much Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez.
Stability and convergence programmes
Mr Katiforis has the floor for seven minutes.
What exactly is this report about?
What were they based on back then?
So what news on this front?
That is one very good point.
We must face up to these risks.
We can support it, as it now stands.
It did, however, always include growth factors.
Mr von Wogau, you referred to possible dangers.
We believe this is still unduly fragmented.
Thank you very much Mr MacCormick.
This is clearly absurd.
What, however, do we say about it?
I think that this is the way forward.
This requires a large contribution from public funds.
Interest rates cannot be lowered as a result.
Economic growth in Europe is slowing down.
We need more forwards on the European economy team.
EMU must not become a straightjacket for Europe.
Mr President, Mr Schmidt is absolutely right.
We all know why this is.
What I am interested in is structural stability.
Many items in the report attest to this.
Others spoke along the same lines.
There is also scope for innovative financing methods.
Certain categories of spending should therefore have priority.
That is a long-standing debate.
They were forwarded to Parliament on 25 April.
Our position on the Irish matter is well known.
Thank you again.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
The debate is closed.
Internet II
Issues of security and data protection are clearly important.
Malcolm Harbour mentioned this.
There is also a need for good quality content.
I think privacy is important for all data.
The Harbour report, however, is very technology-led.
The public task consists of more than providing infrastructure.
Specific groups can then receive additional support.
The House certainly appears to be fully in support.
Finally, the key issues of universal access.
One point always needs underlining.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
Company accounts
I now give the floor to Commissioner Bolkestein.
Why do we need that proposal at all?
Accounting is a technical and perhaps even esoteric issue.
We want it to be up-to-date and forward-looking.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in Strasbourg.
(Applause from the left)
I rise on a point of order.
This is an extremely important and serious issue.
This is completely unacceptable.
The matter shall be followed up thoroughly.
We have taken note of your statement.
Vote
(The President declared the common position adopted)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Relating to Amendment No 4
This wording is more far-reaching.
Relating to Amendment No 14
At least, so you intimated.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Proposal for a joint resolution on the Chernobyl accident
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Roth-Behrendt report (A5-0118/2001)
Cashman report (A5-0318/2001)
It is never mentioned on Italian television.
What is the Commission?
It is never mentioned on Italian television.
The ELDR Group will be pushing the issue further.
, in writing.
The best is the enemy of the good.
Evans J report (A5-0125/2001)
This report raises certain questions.
There is no mention of harmonisation.
Swoboda report (A5-0132/2001)
(I voted for the motion.)
This pretension is both dishonest and vain.
Consequently, we voted against the recommendation.
Four small countries in Europe are multilingual.
They are Belgium, Switzerland, Moldavia and Macedonia.
CederschiÃ¶ld report (A5-0120/2001)
"You are right," I replied.
This is not the case at all.
This would clearly be a definitive operation.
There was no financial need for it.
The Convention is fairly ineffectual in its purpose.
.
CederschiÃ¶ld report (A5-0121/2001)
Let us be clear about one thing.
Nuclear safety
These measures are all in the right direction.
Doyle report (A5-0119/2001)
"But this steak smells like medicine!"
I said to her.
Katiforis report (A5-0127/2001)
.
I have therefore voted against this report.
Harbour report (A5-0116/2001)
For example, here is a glass.
Can you see this glass?
It is to be used for drinking.
The great caution needed is clear.
That concludes Parliament' s agenda.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Agenda
As far as Thursday is concerned:
We therefore agree with the substitution proposal.
(Parliament gave its assent)
The agenda is thus adopted.
Speeches on procedure
Thank you, Mr Ford.
We, Euskal Herritarrok, have paid for that.
The election results give us a clear message.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
Thank you, Mr Obiols i GermÃ .
Madam President.
It has not done so.
Parliament' s services have sent out four reminders.
The Commission has still not replied.
Thank you, Mr Alavanos.
You can count on me to do that.
There is one essential point.
That is the position.
I believe that matters are clear at the moment.
Yes or no?
There are, after all, two cases here.
Thank you, Mr Schulz.
However, that is all forgotten now.
The answer is no.
So far, I have received nothing.
Of course, we shall see to it immediately.
Thank you, Mr Katiforis.
Manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products
.
No, of course not.
An extraordinarily important and pioneering provision.
We have reached agreement on warnings.
Then there is the matter of misleading descriptions.
It was a remarkable conciliation.
I have three concluding observations.
I should like to mention the rapid decision-making.
We have discussed it on a number of occasions.
Jobs are also at stake.
Exports to third countries are a sore point.
In conclusion two more general observations.
The first is on young people and smoking.
That is not universal.
A second observation concerns the subsidies on tobacco.
These are not minor measures.
I wish that were the case on more matters.
Now to come to the point.
Still, there are differences.
Smoking was completely forbidden in the meeting room itself.
This will have to be a future task.
Smoking is therefore a serious threat to public health.
Reason enough to discourage smoking then.
However, many people already smoke.
There were disappointed noises from the Council.
They create a false sense of security among consumers.
Finally, I would like to mention exports.
There will be a transitional scheme for these exports.
This piece of legislation will have a dramatic impact.
However the battle against big tobacco continues.
This will be done before 31 December 2002.
This will greatly increase the impact of these warnings.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Animal nutrition
I think that this is very important.
The big problem comes with control and compliance.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
These were included in the common position.
Mrs Paulsen has just referred to this.
They need to be tightened up quickly.
Thank you very much, Mr Whitehead.
This is also only right.
We are moving towards an enlarged EU.
The future Member States are predominantly agricultural countries.
So be it, the Commission can accept that.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Mobility in teaching and training
I am happy with this report.
There is a mountain of red tape.
The European Parliament has proved to be extremely cooperative.
Is that not so Mr Evans?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
New technologies in tomorrow's education
on the one hand, on three reports:
and on the other hand, on the oral question
Not technologies that individualise, isolate and alienate pupils.
What can we add to the educational business?
My report deals primarily with the past.
What was the European added value?
What results were achieved?
And what lessons were learned for the future?
I will not deal with that.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Things cannot be allowed to continue that way!
Perhaps the Member States can learn from each other.
There is no need to keep reinventing the wheel.
These things cost money, however.
I am sure that the Commissioner will do that.
.
Why?
Belgium has three.
Eighteen countries contributed their experience.
There is a digital discrepancy.
We must tread new paths here.
In some fields they have actually overtaken men.
It received the documents afterwards, immediately afterwards.
These programmes have their purpose!
I hope we can go this way together.
We need to learn from best practice.
We need mobility.
This is important for the internal market.
In fact I prefer that.
What is the issue?
That is what today' s debate is about.
I feel the lack of that debate.
This is understandable because of the timing.
Let us reflect on that for a moment.
However, what is 'demarcation of competence' ?
What is the debate when we are discussing education?
It is about subsidiarity.
To return to Bologna.
It is terribly embarrassing.
I have received piles of letters and e-mails.
E-Learning is becoming increasingly important.
I fully support this.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
I think this debate shows that very well.
We are on the right road together.
Firstly, the concept of subsidiarity.
Three points, therefore, to finish.
The next point is lifelong learning.
The work is to continue.
The White Paper dates from 1995.
That is a long time ago.
There is a change taking place beneath the surface.
A fundamental change is taking place.
I am well aware of this.
That, at least, is a start.
We must continue to nurture that guilty conscience.
Some Members have mentioned subsidiarity.
This is a revolution!
Never!
Yet this is now being done.
It really is extraordinary.
This represents an enormous amount of progress.
That is far from being the case.
Now, we are making progress.
Parliament has the right to take its own initiatives.
The first is the principle of access for everyone.
A computer is only a machine, a tool.
There are also those who have left school.
We must also train our teachers.
Teachers are the key to the success of e-Learning.
This brings me to another subject.
We are travelling together in the right direction.
There are a few small problems here and there.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Ladies and gentlemen, the joint debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.43 p.m.)
Mr President, on a point of order.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I was present yesterday.
We will certainly rectify this.
(The Minutes were approved)
Broad economic guidelines for 2001
.
Other observers expect even lower growth rates.
I very much regret that.
(Applause)
How can we achieve a higher rate of growth?
Privatising major sectors is no easy task.
We all know the consequences of this approach.
No mention of businesses' social responsibilities.
The necessary capital does exist.
This is now impossible.
That too proves to be impossible.
Greater coordination is not the answer.
That illustrates the seriousness of the problem.
Those reforms should make Europe more innovation-friendly.
My final point concerns the environment.
Let us quickly look at its form.
What sort of contradictory statement is this?
This is not the view France takes.
What do we mean by that?
Let me finish with an appeal to the Council.
Now is the time for it to act.
I would like to expand on this.
I personally also support the single sky initiative.
That is essential too.
This is what the Lisbon process requires of us.
Please let us learn from that.
Economic forecasting is not an exact science.
Nor is it within sole EU control.
We are part of a global economy.
We expect and demand better.
Let us now deal with the fundamental issues.
We must include every factor in the broad guidelines.
I will comment briefly on these issues.
These figures must clearly be borne in mind.
The Commission believes that it cannot.
Thank you Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Electrical and electronic equipment
.
The reason is precisely the latter!
I maintain the exact opposite.
I believe that this is a good alternative.
The specialists know what historical waste is.
There is no alternative.
These are the regulatory instruments at our disposal.
It is all about rewarding, not penalising.
It is just about the easiest thing on earth.
These are the really crucial questions.
There is a dispute about lighting equipment.
I support this initiative.
The ultimate aim is waste prevention.
A ban in 2006 is impossible.
Costs must not be passed on to consumers.
Parliament unanimously supports this principle of individual financial responsibility.
I should once again like to congratulate Mr Florenz.
They are toxic and non-biodegradable.
Politicians now need to follow suit.
The principle underlying producer responsibility is of key importance.
Why?
This was evident in the Netherlands too.
Historical waste must be financed collectively.
We know that the substances are hazardous.
We know that they affect children' s concentration.
That is something I cannot understand.
I think that that is wrong.
I am pleased that that is possible.
I will mention one example.
This is the intention behind Amendment No 77.
This is a very important issue.
It seeks to promote eco-design.
Producer responsibility is the key word in this connection.
Even if this involves hazardous substances, unfortunately.
We must apply the polluter-pays principle correctly.
We became aware of this in the committee.
Things are somewhat different with cars.
Cars are taken to the scrap-yard.
Let me answer some of your questions.
I shall begin with the question by Mr Davies.
We are all concerned about brominated flame retardants.
The review should cover all potential hazardous substances.
I turn to Mr Lund's question on Denmark.
Several Members have mentioned the 'visible fee'.
The Commission thinks that this amendment is unnecessary.
I think these were the most important questions raised.
Thank you very much, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Priority substances in water policy
.
This should be continually developed and improved.
The Commission and the Council see a feasibility problem.
This, I believe, is our common objective.
The original Commission proposal was barely in line.
We intend to support its pursuit of that goal.
Our group will not stand in its way.
The timetable for action is not really ambitious.
2020?
Can I refer in concluding to the institutional relationship?
We cannot accept this intermediate category.
Therefore I welcome this attempt to prioritise substances.
Testing techniques are becoming more sensitive.
Minuscule levels of contamination can be detected.
We need not be carried away by our emotions.
Zero emissions is not a realistic aim.
Let us not forget that.
The proposed list is not designed for eternity.
My services have already started preparatory work on this.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
VOTE
In the English version, the wording is correct.
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
Before the vote:
(Parliament accepted the oral amendments)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Amendment No 44:

You put me in some difficulty, Mr Florenz.
We have turned down other requests for split votes.
So we have to vote as it stands.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

Amendment No 7:

I have to express my personal doubts on that.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Kessler and Perry report (A5-0088/2001)
.
Maaten report (A5-0162/2001)
That convinced me to vote for the Maaten report.
(PPE-DE), in writing.
Article 3 lays down the concentration ceilings.
This directive is engaging in overkill.
.
That surely cannot be allowed to happen.
.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
.
But jobs in our countries will be lost.
Unilateral action by the EU will prove fruitless.
Paulsen report (A5-0136/2001)
And that is what I have done.
Evans report (A5-0115/2001)
The European Parliament naturally welcomed this type of proposal.
I am committed to working towards this.
Florenz report (A5-0146/2001)
Florenz report (A5-0148/2001)
He was exhausted and covered in sweat.
.
The wording of Article 7 is somewhat unclear.
Breyer report (A5-0135/2001)
Superior stabat lupus longeque inferior agnus.
Why have I quoted this Latin fable?
Alavanos report (A5-0299/2000)
.
Perry report (A5-0302/2000)
Clearly, I support this conclusion.
Mauro report (A5-0152/2001)
von Wogau report (A5-0165/2001)
.
Issues of employment are completely ignored.
.
That is the very heart of the matter.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Consumption of alcohol by children and adolescents
What are the solutions?
We need to improve data collection and share information.
I hope my colleagues will support this report.
Alcohol is part and parcel of adult social life.
(PPE-DE).
Role models are therefore of the essence.
The consequences of alcohol abuse affect us all.
They affect families and societies.
The addictive aspects are completely different.
Tobacco is immediately addictive, alcohol is not.
This is also preferable for reasons of content.
These predominantly focus on the ingredients of alcohol products.
It could also incorporate the issue of advertising.
They rightly focus on children and adolescents in particular.
This is a useful report.
We are talking about the principle of subsidiarity.
There are sensible things in what is being proposed.
We should ban advertising of alcohol, however implicit.
We cannot combat alcoholism by restricting supply.
We are simply talking about a recommendation.
For instance, advertising comes to mind.
These codes of conduct operate on an EU-wide basis.
It is not a directive or a regulation.
For this reason the amendment is not acceptable.
Some amendments can be partially accepted by the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
General product safety
We do not support this.
One is "where appropriate".
People still die of the effects of unsafe products.
This report can count on our unqualified support.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
COM in beef and veal market
That is no criticism of Mr Fischler himself.
I think they might not.
It is a very long process.
We have seen the effects of BSE.
It has been the archetype of the BSE crisis.
.
Your conversion need not be immediate!
That was the big mistake in Berlin.
It is evident that the sector needs help.
Without farmers we will not have a beef sector.
Already, many farmers are leaving the sector.
It is complicated and administratively difficult.
NGL).
We are in a period of crisis.
Thank goodness for that!
What are we actually asking for?
The rules were laid down in Berlin.
Safety cannot be regulated with premiums.
I think the UK has shown that.
We really have to move forward.
Destruction is also the key.
Mr Busk made a good point.
Why do we have then to destroy them?
.
Some non-EU countries have also relaxed their import bans.
I would say you were constructive.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Sustainable development strategy
I shall now give the floor to Mr Prodi.
That is fine.
He has some very good ideas.
The process, however, is very long.
I hope that this principle will always be applied.
I should nonetheless like to have more practical details.
.
The case of the Kyoto Protocol is extremely significant.
I have two questions.
What do we want to talk about?
.
Instead, an integrated approach is required.
What is that process to look like?
We cannot do more than this.
I fail to understand this sort of discrimination.
What does this mean?
Are there two sorts of Members in Parliament?
Question Time (Commission)
That is the only response I can give you.
We will examine Questions to the Commission.
First Part
Question No 45 by (H-0432/01):
Question No 94 by (H-0393/01):
Question No 95 by (H-0424/01):
The Commission strongly supports these initiatives.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
Have you made any fundamental assessments?
UNICEF strategy focuses on four main areas.
I have a similar question.
I think the answer was given adequately.
What are your views on this?
What specific measures need to be taken?
We must have intelligent sanctions.
What are we trying to do?
Question No 46 by (H-0360/01):
Second Part
Questions to Commissioner Solbes
The honourable Member accuses me of being too brief.
Perhaps I can repeat one other thing.
Thank you very much, Mr Patten.
Question No 48 by (H-0322/01):
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
What is the Commission' s position?
I believe that the Commission has been very clear.
Firstly, I believe that growth is important.
Within growth, it is essential to increase employment.
Question No 49 by (H-0361/01):
How does the Commission intend to pursue this matter?
I would thank the Commissioner for his answer.
I now have a follow-up question for the Commissioner.
What is your opinion of these electoral promises?
It has a different scope.
Mrs McKenna has the floor for a supplementary question.
What is the point in us having a government?
I shall be very brief.
Question No 50 by (H-0385/01):
Questions to Commissioner Fischler
Thank you, Commissioner, for that honest answer.
Question No 51 by (H-0326/01):
Commission.
I will be quite frank with you here.
Question No 52 by (H-0331/01):
I hope that you would not want that!
You are absolutely right though.
Question No 53 by (H-0336/01):
Questions to Commissioner Diamantopoulou
Question No 59 by (H-0349/01):
Question No 60 by (H-0350/01):
What is the Commission's view of this situation?
Question No 61 by (H-0363/01):
I share her view that voluntary action is important.
Most of these enterprises are family businesses.
Many businesses also have a life cycle.
How will the Green Paper deal with these issues?
Question No 62 by (H-0365/01):
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
EEC-Denmark/Greenland Fisheries Agreement
These fishing possibilities are irreplaceable.
We need more realism here.
We need a realistic fisheries policy with Greenland.
I welcome the Commissioner.
That is the heart of the matter.
The whole thing is a wasteful mess.
Negotiations do not take place in a regional context.
That is why we have generally voted against them.
The Greenland agreement is different.
It chose to leave.
We do not owe it any economic aid.
We are dealing with fish.
This should be a commercial activity.
Historic rights are not necessarily right.
First of all let us consider catch quotas.
The Commission therefore cannot accept this proposal either.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Extension of duty-free access to least-developed country products
I am not talking only in terms of trade.
But there I shall leave it for the moment.
Both these interests and these advantages may be legitimate.
The time has come, therefore, to listen...
(President cut the speaker off)
They lack the infrastructure to capitalise on market access.
Unfortunately, the Miranda report contains a few contradictions.
Precisely those products which many countries can offer competitively.
Some regret these concessions.
Thank you for your attention.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Maritime safety
I do not make that point lightly.
The Swedish Presidency was not there at all.
The same goes for the Ortuondo Larrea report.
The Commission and Parliament are ready.
All we need for proper regulation is the Council.
We must be able to find a solution here.
But maybe then it would not take so long.
It is all about the procedure at the moment.
That is one thing.
We absolutely must correct this extremely serious discrepancy.
I therefore welcome the proposals relating to this.
That is good.
There are two interesting factors in this context.
Other efforts are required, too.
However, rules alone are not enough.
Therefore, basically, there is no great dispute.
They have reacted well.
Let us move on to the proposals.
The problem is where.
We cannot, however, accept Amendment No 1.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Uniform driver attestation
That concern is not totally unfounded.
At least, if we consider the transport sector.
The market is distorted by so-called social dumping.
I think he has submitted a very good report.
It was a joint effort.
It is as simple as that.
The underlying reasoning for this is explained later on.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.25 p.m.)
Yet here they are in our own building.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
I will indeed discuss this matter with Mr Solana.
I do not know whether she wishes to reply.
Not at this moment, it would seem.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I agree with Mr Van Orden.
That is quite unacceptable, Mr Caudron.
I shall check what has happened at once.
Believe me, I will look into this matter.
First a positive point.
But now a second matter, Madam President.
I find this unacceptable.
Fortunately, he escaped with his life.
It represents a very positive development.
Welcome
Situation in the Middle East
Distrust between the parties is growing.
Violence is claiming more victims every day.
The economic situation is also difficult.
Israeli civilians and children are being killed.
Quite simply, the security situation has got worse.
There is no long-term military solution.
The conflict will neither be won or lost.
The only solution to the conflict lies in negotiation.
Therefore the peace process must continue.
A diplomatic initiative is required to break the deadlock.
The EU considers that these requirements are justified.
There has been too much bloodshed and fighting.
Violence must stop.
We particularly appreciate the commitments made by Arab countries.
Let me turn now to Israel's settlement policy.
The European Union's position on settlements is clear.
Let me make that point crystal clear.
The European Union must uphold the rule of law.
The position is absolutely clear.
There is no other way.
Thank you, Mr Patten.
A permanent vicious circle of violence has been created.
That, however, is not the case.
The entire territory of Israel?
What territory?
And so the list goes on.
Enough is enough, Mr Sharon.
(Applause from the left)
Not in the view of my group.
What, then, is our policy?
The Mitchell Commission also says this.
There are no military solutions.
I condemn without reservation violence from whatever quarter.
The permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999.
Mr Sharon characterised it as 'unbalanced' .
Surely that Jewish dream demands a European effort too?
But where are today' s European Kreiskys?
The present catastrophic situation is the result.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
There has been quite enough description.
This makes no sense.
It is appalling.
We call for this to be done in Gothenburg.
What Mr Salafranca said makes sense.
The Mitchell Commission has made recommendations.
We have now destroyed it.
I am surprised at such forgetfulness.
We should take a more objective view.
Now it must play an even more active part.
So what can we do?
Israeli withdrawal was met responsibly by the Lebanese.
Mr Sharon must acknowledge his political responsibility.
So what can the EU do further?
We also support the Jordanian-Egyptian initiative.
It is of major international interest.
A great deal has happened since then.
That is a sensible, balanced approach.
I thank Mr Patten for his replies to Members.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
State of the transatlantic dialogue
Transatlantic relations are good.
There is a lot of talk about EU-US cooperation.
My point here is different.
I hope that will not happen.
It is an ambitious goal.
Let me end where I started.
So where are we today?
The communication refers to an Interparliamentary Assembly.
That is not what it is.
It is in some difficulty.
Our dialogue must be frank and sincere.
Sometimes one is chosen, sometimes another.
Is it soft law or hard law?
Self-regulation or co-regulation?
First there is the legacy of the Clinton era.
I think not.
I am thinking here of the Kyoto agreements.
Both the Commission and the Council recognise this.
We should also stress the importance of developing trade.
He is absolutely right.
But we need more than words.
But it is not just Kyoto.
The best security shield is the battle against poverty.
That is the route we should like to take.
But we must get down to work together.
My final point concerns parliamentary relations.
We are starting completely from scratch.
It is still too early to express real concern.
The question is how we react.
Should our reaction lead to a strong anti-American position?
No, of course not.
That must be our position.
Discussions on US missile defence should continue.
I wish Parliament success in this area.
The debate is closed.
VOTE
(The President declared the common position approved)
(Parliament approved the proposal)
(Parliament approved the proposal)
(Parliament approved the initiative)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the recommendation)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Patten, Commission.
So these amendments are not acceptable to the Commission.

Mr Watts has requested the floor.
But I seek clarification on Amendment No 1.
It is an important clarification.
(The President declared the amended common position approved)
(The President declared the amended common position approved)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)

Thank you for that clarification.
After the vote:
Thank you, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt.

Ludford recommendation (B5Â­340/2001)
We have expressed our views on this before.
But not people.
GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez report (A5-0133/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
"Hello.
Is Mr Fatuzzo there?"
"Speaking," I replied.
"What about?"
I asked him.
Please help us!"
These proposals go in the right direction.
.
.
Watts report (A5-0140/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
Better European rules were needed.
However, that is not the case.
We cannot wait for international rules in the IMO.
We cannot compromise on safety.
Rapid and complete compensation of the victims.
Ortuondo Larrea report (A5-0144/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
President.
At last, I understand what is going on!
Now I understand!
van Dam report (A5-0151/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
Calendar of part-sessions
.
Stihler report (A5- 150/2001)
Madam President, this was an extremely important report.
We have to address this issue.
There is something seriously wrong here.
It is completely unacceptable.
We need to address this.
We need proper restrictions on the advertising of alcohol.
Who would not do so?
Yet the producers do have a role to play.
We want to retain this system.
Therefore, we are voting against this proposal.
For these reasons, I preferred to abstain.
Sturdy report (A5-142/2001)
This problem has yet to be resolved.
Isn't BSE a good thing!
I also hope that this will not happen.
I therefore voted for the motion.
We have also voted against Parliament' s report.
Both proposals are along the wrong lines.
The proposal is all too short-term.
It does not limit the production of beef.
That mainly means reducing prices.
The European Commission is still clearing up after BSE.
The matter is still not over.
I have voted against the Sturdy proposal.
And this is exactly what is happening.
.
There is no reason for further increasing subsidies.
Langenhagen report (A5-0129/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
We should let every State catch its own fish!
Miranda report (A5-0128/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
That is why we abstained.
That concludes voting time.
Situation of Turkish prisoners
This is a major human tragedy.
Their condition is worsening day by day.
Suitable medical care must also be provided.
We all know that.
The law is one thing and generosity is another.
That is the problem.
How to create trust?
They are not making so many incredibly complicated demands.
It is important to recognise that.
We must not forget human values.
All prisoners must be treated equally.
And yet everyone needs human contact and interaction.
My group cannot regulate Turkey's internal affairs.
Human rights must apply to everyone, including prisoners.
That is why we must speak out.
There they experience many difficulties.
The only crime was the selling of Bibles.
Naturally, I regret this incident.
I shall say no more.
Let us not have a row now.
Unfortunately no action has yet been taken.
It is not the political aspect which bothers me.
And rightly so.
It is a scandal.
You must have misunderstood me, Mr Swoboda.
Of course, I take the incident extremely seriously.
There is, however, one problem.
We have about 15 posts blocked.
The debate is closed.
Situation in FYROM
Then, intensive shuttle diplomacy was also started.
These prospects now need to be given tangible form.
The EU shall continue to give its unrestricted support.
The European Parliament has acted consistently since 1993.
Elections were held in Kosovo last year.
But we have no proof of that.
It may well be a very good constitution.
It is just not on.
You have to learn from your mistakes.
We could have told them.
So I think that mistakes were made.
Now back to Macedonia.
In English it would be "Situation FYROM".
It is the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
I take up the Council's suggestion.
So what is to be done?
I think this is the right step to take.
However, we must think one step ahead.
What was done in Zagreb was a good thing.
Therefore those political criteria must be fulfilled.
That caused a row.
It is not just the responsibility of the Macedonians.
Thank you very much, Mr Katiforis.
The debate is closed.
Statute and financing of European political parties
(The sitting was adjourned for five minutes)
The Treaties make no mention of European political parties.
Thank you, Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
The rapporteur may have the floor too.
Mr Dupuis has the floor.
So I am most decidedly against this motion.
Mr President, we debated this matter in committee.
It has been discussed.
(Murmurs of dissent)
Mr Poettering has the floor.
However, we have taken note of your suggestion.
That is also in the interest of European citizens.
We do not wish to do this.
We cannot collaborate in this.
We have therefore acted totally conscientiously.
That is my first point.
We would be creating a monster.
I should like to say three things.
That is a problem.
Parties should be bottom-up and not top-down organisations.
Combating social exclusion
to prevent risks of exclusion;
to rally all the parties involved.
Only a few formal matters have been adopted.
That is, I believe, unacceptable.
The following amendments cannot be accepted.
I have a couple of questions for the Commissioner.
Is that correct?
Is that also correct?
It is very difficult to change it.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Safe and sustainable pensions
The debate has been taken beyond mere financial considerations.
Europe is ageing.
No Biblical curse is about to befall us.
They are the reserves we have to mobilise.
That is not how things stand, however.
There are two ways of approaching this.
It is essential to link the two.
I should like to mention four.
Much has been said about solidarity and security.
My colleagues have expressed unease over certain crucial points.
What will happen to security?
How will it affect women?
I believe this is unrealistic.
In the first case a gradual approach is essential.
Mr President, this is a very good report.
A variety of measures is needed for this.
This reform is social and economic in nature.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0323/01):
There are differences of opinion among Member States.
This is a sensitive issue for many Member States.
Question No 2 by (H-0325/01):
My second question concerns the future.
Question No 3 by (H-0329/01):
Can the Council confirm this information ?
The code you mentioned might or might not exist.
I cannot therefore comment on this.
Question No 4 by (H-0330/01):
The Council is not turning a blind eye.
Question No 5 by (H-0335/01):
I think we are all familiar with them.
Question No 6 by (H-0338/01):
We too have worked on this.
This directive says nothing about definitive licensing.
That needs to be decided in the release directive.
I totally share the honourable Member' s view.
Question No 7 by (H-0340/01):
Thank you for your answer.
Secondly, Mr SjÃ¶stedt refers to the loyalty principle.
This is not new.
I nonetheless wish to ask a question.
I think the risk of self-censorship is very slight.
We have compulsory registers.
We have clearly defined provisions governing secrecy etc.
If not, when will it be in operation?
I rather think that is impossible.
Question No 8 by (H-0342/01):
In other words, he threatens all and sundry.
The second supplementary question is by Mr Fatuzzo.
You have the floor.
Such monitoring is taking place.
Questions Nos 9 and 10 lapse.
There can be no doubt about that.
Question No 11 by (H-0348/01):
Question No 12 by (H-0352/01):
Is the possibility of economic sanctions under consideration?
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
Question No 13 by (H-0353/01):
There are so many other dates.
Question No 14 by (H-0356/01):
I cannot understand your reply.
Question No 15 by (H-0357/01):
Thank you for your answer.
The matter is clear.
That was something you promised last time.
Do you intend to send out that information?
I hope that it is on its way.
Question No 16 by (H-0359/01):
What improvements are planned?
Question No 17 by (H-0377/01):
Much has been achieved.
You yourself mentioned the Berbers.
That is why we want Association Agreements.
Question No 18 by (H-0366/01):
The Regulation came into force on 5 May 2001.
The Community has just given up the tariff.
We shall now invoke the Rules of Procedure.
Questions Nos 21 and 22 have been withdrawn.
That concludes Question Time.
Aid scheme for olive oil
Both these documents are sound in principle.
This is a far more efficient method of monitoring.
This measure has not been implemented correctly, however.
Here I shall ask the Commission a formal question.
The Regulation expires on 31 October 2001.
This concept is quite unclear.
We must reject this proposal.
This would consequently increase opportunities for fraudulent practices.
I should like to cite two examples here.
The same applies to market balance.
Only 6% has been recovered so far.
We really do have our work cut out here.
Mr Casaca's report shows us how.
First to Mr Casaca's report.
These doubts should come as no surprise.
I should like to comment on all four.
The outstanding problems are connected with marketing structures.
This is certainly a good idea.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Draft SAB 2/2001
That would have been too confusing.
That is a reality.
That is what it is all about.
It is very dangerous.
Tonight we are discussing an unnecessary EUR 10 million.
Now their project has run out of control.
I really expected nothing of the sort.
At times we remember this and smile.
So support in principle is there.
Which is unacceptable.
That cannot be.
Now is not the time to be petty.
We should not start by being petty.
That cannot be.
Another problem is the overlapping of functions.
This overlapping must definitely be prevented.
We have the greatest respect.
Here too we are of one opinion.
We have our doubts.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Commission presentation of the preliminary draft budget for 2002
These reforms entailed an increase in expenditure.
Obviously, I need to explain this.
We really must cover the risks properly here.
I am anticipating the debate on the Buitenweg report.
Initial measures will be needed next year.
By that I mean both new and traditional priorities.
That sounds solid enough.
Commissioner Schreyer has just quoted a few figures here.
The actual figures will be available in the autumn.
Nonetheless, the reasons behind certain estimates require clarification.
I should like to remind you of this resolution.
What will happen then?
We shall see.
I thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner.
Estimates of the European parliament for 2002
An interinstitutional working party was even set up.
Equality of opportunity is still not a reality.
Enlargement: of course we must prepare for enlargement.
Why are there no other options in situ?
That is our job as representatives of the people.
That is best done locally.
The Commission is on the right track here.
But that is only the second cheapest solution.
We must be clear about that.
The cheapest solution would be to build ourselves.
We could show a bit more intelligence here.
That would be the cheapest solution.
I consider that far too dangerous.
We too can take the tram now.
Perhaps we can take the metro in Brussels.
That would take us one stage further.
My sincerest thanks go to her accordingly.
The other problem is buildings policy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11 p.m.)
Address by Mr Schuster, President of the Slovak Republic
(Applause)
Our common Europe.
We have to jointly focus on two areas.
Europe is not only a map.
This was not a good situation for Slovakia.
Thank you for this opportunity of addressing you
(Loud and sustained applause)
Your tribute was extremely moving.
Thank you once again.
(Loud applause)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
That is one thing.
Everyone is well aware of that.
The two are wholly unconnected.
The people are there.
We do not need any new posts.
What is important is that we improve security.
Mr Ferber is right there.
(Applause)
Thank you Mr Provan.
We will see if that is possible tomorrow morning.
I am joking.
He obviously never wanted anything like this to happen.
What did happen was that three people
He expresses his dismay and apologises to the House.
(Applause)
I did say it yesterday to your representative.
There must be no repeat of this!
Quite, Mrs Pack.
It would not be proper to proceed otherwise.
Is that what you said yesterday, Mr Berthu?
The relevant provision was Rule 143.
I would like to make something clear.
That is what it says.
That was not the case.
Are there any other comments?
Quite, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
We will make that change to the Minutes.
We will look into all that, of course.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Agenda
Who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?
(Loud applause)
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
So I cannot understand the rush.
Rule 143 has been applied.
That really is quibbling.
Afterwards, Parliament will decide.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Status and financing of European political parties
Parties are the foundation stone of democracies.
The party political landscape is hardly uncomplicated.
This work cannot be done by a national party.
This goes further than existing national legislation on parties.
I cannot recommend detailed rules at present.
.
We want more transparency.
We want straightforward financial control, Commissioner Schreyer.
That is completely inappropriate!
(Applause)
They are the political parties.
This is an open debate.
We have not taken drastic action.
There was no other way until now.
Needless to say, nothing has happened in secret.
That is of key importance.
Someone will then need to put forward these candidates.
It should be the other way round.
There is more to say on this subject.
We should examine these aspects further.
It had to be done in the twilight zone.
We need a solid basis, transparency and control.
I do not think that this is the case.
Nevertheless they are still democrats.
There has never been a reasoned response.
We are not against Europe.
Neither are we against political parties!
We are against illegal discrimination against parties.
It does not authorise any discrimination between them.
This is contrary to the principle of equality.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Please try to measure your words.
The discrimination issue is just as glaringly obvious.
That is a political judgment!
However, what are political parties?
Nobody wants to talk about this.
That is incredible!
Mr BarÃ³n thinks that somebody here is against parties!
That is an exclusive rule.
This was in July 2000.
It does not really ensure transparency.
That is called organised corruption.
Fewer and fewer people are joining political parties.
It is an enormous problem we are creating.
We are after all living in a multi-party democracy.
Parties are not an end in themselves.
It contributes to making the post-Nice process more democratic.
Here we are, faced with another of its innovations
This is a sound legal base for this proposal.
The right rules need to be found for this.
Would an adjustment have to be made each time?
For this reason we explicitly propose the figure five.
Why this temporary status?
Party financing is a politically sensitive issue.
It is in the democratic interest.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
EUROJUST
Money launderers must feel just as vulnerable as polluters.
This is a fundamental prerequisite for success.
With Eurojust these obstacles should now be surmounted.
We see that we can all cooperate.
We shall bring about practical results.
This gives rise to a few questions.
What protection will be provided for this information?
Who can access and use it?
The stakes are as high as they can be.
Eurojust is about giving Europol a real judicial partner.
Traditional enforcement measures are no longer enough.
Our group will be supporting this report.
I am told Saint-Just was a good lawyer too.
In principle, then, Eurojust works like Europol.
I would congratulate the rapporteur.
She has proposed that Luxembourg should be the seat.
Eurojust is to operate with appreciable independent status.
Fourthly and lastly, data protection.
Not perfect, but an essential first step.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a moment.
Thank you very much Madam President.
VOTE
Before the vote on Amendment No 12:
After the vote on Amendment No 54:
A new situation has arisen.
Before the vote on Amendment No 46:
Quite.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
For that reason this amendment is redundant.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on transatlantic relations
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
So you are quite entitled to present it now.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
I do apologise!
I can understand your being embarrassed, Mr CoÃ»teaux.
This is all rather stupid, really!
I am the President of the European Parliament.
Will Europe succeed?
It is in fact concentrated in many specific blackspots.
It is essential that we are given this opportunity.
Ferber report (A5-0138/2001)
'How are you?' asks the captain.
'Fine, and you?' answers the general.
'Not so good,' says the Italian.
'Why?'
'How much is it?
Oh, three times as much as mine!
Schleicher report (A5-0167/2001)
The same applies to European parties.
We should not close the doors on the future.
For this reason I voted against donations by companies.
What about those who would challenge the Treaties?
They are pariahs, vermin, scum.
They will be deprived of financing.
They will be prosecuted.
They will be dragged before the courts.
The perversion, however, does not end there.
The Treaty contains provisions concerning the political parties.
The first reason concerns the content of the report.
.
The word 'appear' is highly suspicious.
Woe betide that it should say the opposite!
.
It is therefore important that we regulate on this.
Today' s decision is premature.
There is no Community competence.
Next, democracy means transparency.
Democracy is also respect for minorities.
.
We cannot be bought.
Lobbyists often perform the useful task of informing us.
JovÃ© Peres report (A5-0137/2001)
It is almost time for lunch, Madam President.
Such monitoring has not operated at all satisfactorily.
Gebhardt report (A5-0153/2001)
This apparent moderation, however, conceals several traps.
Is this progress in common security?
That is deplorable.
I feel uncomfortable in approving the so-called compromise resolution.
I find too many condemnations of Israel in it.
And Europe never spoke up at times like that.
Cercas report (A5-0147/2001)
.
We have more than enough to deal with.
Pensions will thus become unsafe, untenable and unaffordable.
The Commission document has a much more targeted approach.
.
We therefore cannot vote for the report.
'Live longer, save more, spend less!'
The fact of the matter is simply this.
People are living longer.
People are leading healthier lives.
For that reason, I abstained.
So there you have it!
.

Buitenweg report (A5-0166/2001)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Situation in Algeria
How exactly?
The situation is really very critical.
Are they supposed to keep quiet as well?
Mr President, Algeria has a turbulent history.
President Bouteflika has taken steps towards opening up Algeria.
He has moved towards reform.
Real and substantive reforms are required.
The MEDA agreements demand respect for diversity.
One third of the Algerian population are Berbers.
Pluriformity should form part of the state fabric.
President Bouteflika constantly promises to contain the violence.
Yet many of our hopes have not been fulfilled.
There can be no consensus here.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken today at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in Bosnia/Herzegovina, particularly Banya Luka
We cannot be deterred now, however.
This mosque was not destroyed in any war.
We never liked this Agreement.
This situation has proved highly problematical in practice.
In essence, we have created an artificial product.
It is extremely difficult.
The numbers of people returning are still too low.
They will never be successful.
We also need to call a spade a spade.
Dayton was a step towards the absence of war.
We obviously need more practice!
Then there is the debate about three reports.
No break is scheduled between 5.30 and 6.00 p.m.
Human rights
Cameroon
Ethiopia
This is painful.
Unfortunately, this image has been brutally shattered.
Europe can play a crucial role in this.
Cameroon
However, that is not enough, of course.
Cameroon suffers from an enormously huge problem of lawlessness.
They deserve and have our solidarity.
Press freedom in the world
We must also look at ourselves.
That affects diversity in a fundamental way.
That is when freedom is at risk.
Mr President, I speak as a journalist.
Then something absolutely regrettable happened.
Last Sunday, 18 million Italians gave their answer.
We only believe in positive values.
The matter has still not been settled.
In many cases, the journalists involved get killed.
The trend is clear.
There are similar developments in other countries too.
Support under the European initiative should continue.
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Forced labour by African children
Children are being shipped off to work on plantations.
In short, children are often slaves.
After all, we are all Europeans.
That contravenes all kinds of ILO Treaties.
That is not done, however.
Children have human rights, which are fundamental agreements.
That is a situation which simply cannot be tolerated.
Child traffickers rarely get caught or punished.
That makes us indirect accessories to what is happening.
What is the point?
(Applause from the left)
The Commission emphatically supports these initiatives.
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
I have an announcement to make.
Floods in France
The financial consequences are unquantifiable as yet.
Houses are subsiding.
That is the purpose of my amendment.
We must take both immediate and long-term action.
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters
This will make mutual recognition more and more difficult.
I could quote many examples.
Mr President, I fully agree with Mrs Palacio.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
The concept originates from the internal market.
Works councils and redundancies
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
I have hardly sat down.
Restructuring is often used as a euphemism for redundancies.
We hope that a consensus will be reached.
Now to the Statute for European Companies.
This is often not the case.
My second and final point relates to mergers.
Have I understood correctly?
What are your plans on this matter?
They must instead be the main beneficiaries of it.
For which I also thank you.
The results of this examination are not yet ready.
That brings us to the end of that item.
Gas directive
Can we believe a word it says?
The debate is closed.
VOTE
The next item is the vote
Mr President, on a point of order.
You make a very valid point.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
'Cristina, I am a Europeanist!'
I replied.
'Great!
'Don' t worry,' I told her.
.
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was adjourned at 6.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Agenda
The next item is the order of business.
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
We want quicker justice and tougher legislation.
We cannot rely solely on late, restrictive documents.
We must start to take effective action.
This is what is called ENFOPOL 29.
It has never been discussed in this Parliament.
It is a fundamental rights issue.
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
I should like to repeat the call.
We need to debate this.
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
Specific technological R & D programme
The specific programmes are the instruments for implementation.
The proposals do, however, provide some clarification.
I would like to reiterate the main principles.
This is the meaning of Article 169.
Thank you, Mr Busquin, for your statement.
That is a major achievement.
Surely that would be a far more practical approach.
What are the reasons?
I think that the current shortcomings are well known.
We must encourage coherent action.
That was not my question, however.
I hope that this will now change.
Let us discuss this.
European research is therefore absolutely urgent.
My second question concerns the instruments.
I also have a tie-breaker question.
Thank you, Mr Caudron.
The proposal is, therefore, understood.
I hope that our proposal will be adopted.
My last point relates to the Joint Research Centre.
Studies of this type are planned.
They must step up their efforts.
I fully understand this question.
There is no contradiction whatsoever.
There are several angles of attack.
These aspects must always be taken into consideration.
The second question relates to the instruments.
Mr Westendorp y Cabeza has asked a fundamental question.
We will try to answer it point by point.
I have already mentioned this.
This is the negative aspect.
We are managing 14 000 projects.
That is our aim.
I fully support what Mr Rovsing has said.
This is absolutely clear.
That is the task we must undertake together.
Thank you, Mr NisticÃ².
This is one of the fundamental criteria.
Thank you, Mr Busquin.
The debate is closed.
Can I make a suggestion for the future.
It might help us.
Certainly, Mr Purvis.
Your suggestion has my support.
Treaty of Nice and the future of the EU
Amsterdam is one more step in that direction.
Why do I say this?
Because we want serious and far-reaching solutions.
We want a convention.
Thank you, Mr Seguro.
That is a good sign!
, Council.
Europe must mean more than a market.
I think this is a good thing.
Democracy is not a zero sum game.
We need a combination.
I now look forward to your viewpoints.
This legal problem has not been resolved in Nice.
This frankly causes frustration in Parliament.
That is why the Charter must be made binding.
We must make this European Union democratic.
That must be the starting point!
(Applause)
(Applause)
I represent fisheries policy.
A mere consultation of Parliament is not enough.
It is only logical.
We therefore have a joint responsibility.
Madam President-in-Office, we appreciate that.
It is true that we were rather critical earlier.
(Applause)
We must correct that.
We must therefore change it for the future!
(Applause)
It is a nice colour.
However, we wish you much success for Gothenburg!
So best wishes for Gothenburg!
(Applause)
The forum now exists.
These people are themselves still incomplete democrats.
We, the EU, could not act.
If not NATO there was nothing.
The Intergovernmental Conference in Nice was a failure.
It is the hour of the parliaments.
Long live the European Republic!
Nice has weakened the Community.
Nice was a step backwards in terms of integration.
What kind of talk is that?
Is it not the people who supervise their democracies?
No, it has to be the EU Ã©lites.
What kind of view of democracy is that?
The Danish people are not being asked.
We oppose any form of European nationalism.
Almost everything has already been said about Nice.
The arguments put forward for that are not convincing.
Be warned!
They are all extremely useful.
Of course it does.
Congratulations.
I do not believe that this is correct.
So what should have been done in Nice instead?
But no!
Instead, you want to reform everything else.
This has opened up the fight for power.
Where is the real cohesion?
Exactly the opposite.
Nothing more and nothing less.
Who is abandoning ship here?
Drafting a European constitution is another perverse fantasy.
Treaties can only be reformed by Treaties.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is not our view.
Maybe we would not be facing this debacle now.
That appears to be the best solution to me.
The public can see through this particular fanciful idea.
Why is only Ireland holding a referendum?
Why not Denmark and others?
Rejecting Nice would have caused delay and confusion.
(The President cut the speaker off)
During that time nobody knows what is happening.
Perhaps it will be a convention after all.
So what will it be?
It is not a good solution!
Some Heads of Government are also doing so.
We expect their support on these two matters.
This is an unparliamentary and undemocratic method.
Only certain matters were regulated by a common authority.
How did they deal with decision-making in those days?
That was only possible following approval from the province.
I would call that into question.
Decision-making will mainly depend on consensus among governments.
That is why I shall be voting against it.
They deserve our sincere thanks.
Unfortunately, the draft repeatedly speaks of a constitution.
We do not need any new institutions.
Let us strengthen the existing institutional triangle.
This is the desire of many people in Europe.
That should be unthinkable.
The lowest possible number!
We have already endured that situation.
We are not convinced this is the right course.
We believe that there should be an early IGC.
I look forward to the debate at that time.
One thing is quite clear, however.
Parliament cannot stand on the sidelines of this debate.
This is a cause for concern.
It is why we cannot say a clear yes.
This Parliament must therefore be strengthened.
We unite people, not states.
Mr President, five arguments.
This is the first treaty which puts Europe back.
Mr President.
I agree with much of the criticism.
This is something that we must change.
No outsiders were allowed to participate in the process.
Let us not do this again.
How is this to be done?
What tools shall we use?
We must start with the objective debate.
The answer is clearly no!
Nice is too restricted as a step forward.
This was also its main task.
This report does not close off any options.
More than anything, I want more democracy.
What is our common objective?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Council and Commission mission to Korea
In summary, the results were good.
The exports were a purely commercial issue.
The EU' s visit was a fruitful one.
Clearly North Korea is a state of concern.
Obviously we welcome the moratorium.
Some would even say it was going backwards.
Thank you for your contributions.
Thank you for this additional response.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Environmental policy
"Is there one single creature in the air,
on earth, in the water,
that we do not kill or destroy?
No physical force,
or skill,
let alone craftiness or deception
can save them
from our destructive power.
No rock is too hard,
no mountain too high or mighty,
no tree too majestic or mature:
We can obliterate it all.
No bird flies too high in the sky,
no fish swims too deep in the sea,
no animal is too remote,
in lonely places.
We can control it,
We can kill it."
This poem expresses a deep compassion for creation.
More attention ought to be devoted to this.
Separate indicators involve far more surveys.
Greater expansion decidedly dominates current economic practice.
That is far too restricted.
No, it is not.
So what is sustainability?
This is not satisfactory.
The point has somehow been missed.
It is about utilising the economy that exists.
We also have a responsibility in international trade relations.
It cannot be simply an empty manifesto.
This criticism can no longer be levelled at us.
It will mean discarding unsustainable subsidies.
This is therefore the vital task for us.
So what do these young people have?
They have involvement, they have enthusiasm.
What do they lack?
What do we owe them?
I believe this conclusion complements that of Mr Blokland.
In other words we cannot afford to wait.
We must combat discrimination and poverty.
Many things have been considered.
Models for these exist.
Trade in environmental assets must be fair.
Sustainable development must be given a practical dimension.
Moreover, such markets also yield new employment.
Which brings us to the third point: compliance.
There is a great deal of sound European legislation.
It is therefore necessary to comply with these laws.
However, that is often a problem.
Politically, we have three demands of Gothenburg.
We need environmental and social criteria for public procurement.
We need the means to do so, however.
Perhaps the general comments could be shortened instead.
I wish the Swedish Presidency luck with this.
The PPE-DE will support the report.
It contains important emphases for environmental policy.
I think more could have been said about that.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Sustainable development concerns all policy areas.
Social policy is also naturally part of sustainable development.
Good social policy and fair economic policy are vital.
The legislation must continue.
Naturally, my group supports these two reports wholeheartedly.
We must all realise this.
They must simply be phased out.
We cannot afford to keep them in place.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We need to acknowledge ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
I think this is clear in the programme.
This is naturally vital.
Thank you for this debate.
Council.
This is actually nothing new.
This shows that decoupling is already taking place.
These are two further examples of decoupling.
The marine ecosystem around our coasts is in crisis.
Thank you, Mr Larsson.
The debate is closed.
Community Environment Action Programme (2001-2010)
I wish them every success.
Achieving environmental targets requires cooperation.
Therefore, these also require greater environmental expertise.
Environmental assessments must also be included in economic decisions.
I see this as particularly welcome.
We must also ensure the major participation of citizens.
Firstly, it is necessary to apply the legislation.
This has still not been done properly.
We need more sustainable models of production and consumption.
The interest in this programme is clear.
The first is the application of Community law.
The second is the promotion of citizen participation.
We must find a method for complying with it.
This is unfortunately the only thing the governments understand.
This is absurd.
We support the Commission.
Neither is it a project for Gothenburg.
I remember that the Commissioner shared our view.
In many ways, she re-wrote the document.
We therefore offer our hesitant support to this process.
It is also true that short documents save trees.
I cannot therefore but support the honourable Member.
One last but illustrative point.
I am unable to congratulate the rapporteur.
That is not industry, it is the consumer.
I am sure we could have included it.
I feel sorry for the Commission officials!
That was when I read the communication.
There is always something missing.
In the articles there are only vague allusions.
Either list of examples can be used.
There is nothing about that at all.
What does "revising" mean?
Does it mean raising the standards?
So we need greater clarity here.
The extensive explanatory note was much better.
Hence the many amendments.
That is why I welcome this fresh initiative.
Is this the best way of protecting the environment?
However, we should not despair.
The Commission can still rescue it at second reading.
That too receives my unqualified support.
Two matters are of key importance to me.
First of all, compliance.
She has also confirmed this in the previous debate.
My second point concerns international cooperation.
Sustainable development should not remain within European borders.
International agreements are important.
I would welcome this greatly.
I hope that I have succeeded in this.
Thank you once again.
This is what we learned.
I wanted to make it an action programme.
I would like to say something about thematic strategies.
That has been our objective all the time.
Finally, we welcome this opinion.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Environmental impact of certain plans and programmes
.
I was not entirely satisfied with this solution.
Thank you all.
Allow me to draw your attention to another weakness.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers
They hardly considered the environmental aspect at all.
We reached a compromise ultimately, however.
Noise-reducing tyres are already available.
That is not true!
So more can be done than proposed.
Thank you, Mr Lange.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Financial Regulation applicable to the EC general budget
So, Commissioner, we followed your lead.
We proposed a great many amendments.
We stressed the independence of OLAF.
So that finishes my five minutes as rapporteur.
It is, after all, rather strange.
Then re-tables them on behalf of its chair.
Its Kramer versus Kramer.
What would you do?
It seems a bit bizarre to me.
Others have come in from the Court of Auditors.
We are not here to give the Commission discharge.
However, we shall see tomorrow morning.
Most groups showed a great willingness to compromise.
Has this test been met?
Second, the disciplinary procedure must be strengthened.
There has been too little action in the past.
Amendment No 72 sets this out.
Thank you, Mr van Hulten.
I want to be proud of what we do.
Another extremely important point concerns delays in payments.
However, change is absolutely essential.
In principle we support the proposals of the rapporteur.
They deserve praise and recognition for this.
Around EUR 2 billion were lost.
That is an extremely worrying phenomenon.
That must be replaced by decentralised ex post control.
We debated this very issue at an earlier occasion.
Remedial action is more than necessary.
The financial controller is also anchored in the Treaty.
The proposal therefore contains a fundamental simplification and restructuring.
Then an important point.
There will be no more negative expenditure and revenue.
That is a very important point.
You have chosen the wrong example there!
There are no ex ante controls in customs.
It is exactly the same with structural aids.
That increases transparency over all.
Do you wish to be heard?
You have the floor.
.
This will happen at the ECOFIN meeting next week.
Thank you.
Mr Dell'Alba has asked to speak.
Mr President, it is 11.20.
I just wanted to clarify something for Mrs Schreyer.
That you intervened is a first.
Thank you, Mr van Hulten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Compulsory safety belts
.
This is an important issue.
We are talking about around 42,000 people a year.
My answer is yes.
I think it is very important.
We know that safety belts save lives.
This is particularly the case regarding children.
There is therefore a need for such a system.
All these are good proposals.
However, we propose six amendments.
More details would be taking us too far here.
Tremendous progress has been made in road traffic safety.
Development work is continuing.
That is where these systems fail.
We now believe that to be unnecessary.
Thank you very much.
Parliament thanks the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Equal treatment for men and women
Maternity protection also needs strengthening.
This is sexual discrimination, which is banned.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The Commission braced itself for the task.
I regret the amendments that introduce so-called definitions.
(The President cut the speaker off)
You can count on my group at any rate.
It is terribly difficult to combat.
Victims feel they are alone.
Hence our amendment.
We have talked a great deal about sexual harassment.
We have also talked about paternity leave.
So much for equality!
Who are these associations?
What exactly are we envisaging for the future?
Our society is aspiring towards a new feminism.
We are women, wives and mothers.
They are still few in number.
I think this is excellent.
The example shows the need for the new directives.
The legislation would provide protection for them.
How can we achieve equality without laws?
Why are they important?
Why is this directive so important?
Women who bear children enjoy special protection in law.
There is one minor difference.
Children are born to mothers, not fathers.
Those are our stated goals.
This also cries out for further equality.
Women still suffer discrimination in the labour market.
Women still earn less than men.
Women are under-represented in senior management.
The proposed reform does not go far enough.
We need targeted re-integration measures after career breaks.
Another problem, Mr President, is sexual harassment.
I support the amendments that would facilitate this.
Today' s legislation sets a new milestone.
It is better to tackle this problem now.
In conclusion, discrimination is often connected with gender.
I wonder if we should not provide one.
I congratulate everyone on this, especially Mrs Hautala.
I introduced that in my own country.
Secondly, positive action.
Thirdly, equal pay.
Take the example of equal pay.
But it does not happen in boom times either.
Sexual harassment is a repugnant phenomenon.
The Commission never intended such a ban.
This would be unrealistic and over-complicated.
The Commission can accept the latter wording.
This goes beyond the scope of the directive.
I would like to congratulate you.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Integrated European labour market 1998-1999
This will also make our job easier.
I cannot support this approach.
I would like to add two comments.
My third point concerns the necessary subsidiarity.
There is very little mobility of workers within Europe.
A mere 0.4%.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m..

In candidate countries we see a similar contradiction.
Roo Report (A5-0178/2001)
'Really?'
I answered.
'How have you come to understand that?'
Don' t you see?
In his name there are tyres and wheels.
In particular, the following are worthy of note:
We are not even discussing it.
Some provisions even contradict it openly.
This quality should not be underestimated.
The debate is underway.
.
.
We further protest against the militarisation of the EU.
.
.
.
.
We now come to the question of the container.
This is why I have voted against.
.
.
The rapporteur does not offer that alternative.
.
These are serious shortcomings.
Myller Report (A5-175/2001)
The young, the middle-aged, the old?'
We cannot answer for the replacement of production aids.
Changes in direction are now possible and desirable.
.
.
I voted against.
The objectives that it sets out are too precise.
This applies in the case of environmental responsibility.
We have to choose between them.

Is that what we want?

Ribeiro e Castro Report (A5-168/2001)

But what does voluntary mean?
Parliament has completed its agenda.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 1.50 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
Relating to Wednesday:
None of you wanted this last week.
Thank you, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
Madam President, let me make an alternative suggestion.
This is completely possible.
We have the whole morning for these two discussions.
Madam President, thank you very much.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Madam President, I have another question regarding Wednesday.
We are on the way to a five-day Wednesday!
The order of business is thus established.
Speeches relating to procedure:
The Irish people are a generous people.
It was a decision made in good faith.
The will of the Irish people must be respected.
We should not rush into a debate.
It is time for reflection and analysis.
Clarification is undoubtedly necessary.
They have a social conscience and favour enlargement.
The Irish people will resolve their own problems.
I welcome his conversion.
I hope that Roger is enlightened now.
I believe we are different.
Yet we are the same as everybody else here.
We have good people and bad people.
Thank you, Mr McCartin.
I shall therefore give him the floor once again.
(Laughter and applause)
I warn against that.
I intend to speak in our common language.
Thank you, Mr Perry.
My question was very precise.
That was my question.
Yes, that was why.
Your comments have been noted.
There have been no new developments, Mr Schulz.
This is not the case at all.
This is clear.
Thank you, Mr Alyssandrakis.
I would like to bring up two points.
First of all, the death penalty.
This should be pointed out.
My next point refers to the debate on Ireland.
Sexual exploitation of children - Trafficking in human beings
, rapporteur.
This is another innovation which we have proposed.
These are the figures on which the Commission proceeds.
In my view, victim protection is especially important.
We must make sure that we stamp that out.
Both are on the increase.
Any form of child abuse is ruthless!
Legal assistance and psychological support are very important.
The first example is penalties.
More guarantees must be offered in this connection.
Where are the bottlenecks?
And where is development cooperation in this respect?
These additions affect at least three points.
That means incitement and not just fraud.
This is another important point.
I would like to thank the two rapporteurs.
Does this proposal allow for sufficient cooperation?
However, I share Mrs Ludford' s doubts.
We should never have let things get this far.
This is the first factor.
The second factor is contempt towards children.
We added to them.
It is difficult to ask for the impossible.
They can do this purely to avoid criminal sanctions.
I do not think we can believe that.
What measures?
All the preventive options must be expanded further.
Now, it has been introduced into Europe.
The European Parliament synthesises the tensions present in society.
I support the proposals put forward in the report.
Providing victims with assistance and protection is equally important.
Let me now turn to Mrs Karamanou's report.
The Commission cannot therefore agree to the suggested amendments.
That is true.
Animal welfare
I am satisfied that this is not the case.
These discussions are genuinely worthwhile.
This is changing fast.
People care deeply about the treatment of animals.
These sentiments are also feeding into the market.
I spoke at length on this in Stockholm recently.
This is unfair, untrue and counterproductive.
This is unfair.
Europe is progressively implementing higher welfare standards.
How are the animals transported?
I greatly welcome this statement.
We cannot have that.
Viable solutions must be devised.
The policy is unilaterally focused on cheap production.
Drastic improvements are required in terms of their accommodation.
Long hauls with live cattle must be abolished.
The inspection of cattle transports must be tightened considerably.
Cattle markets must be abolished.
This is therefore progress.
Animal ethics is about much more than mere rules.
However, there is no functioning supervisory apparatus.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I take them around.
They are not stocks and shares.
They are not speculative metals.
They are sentient creatures.
It will certainly have our support.
Those things seem to me to be enormously important.
I have asked you a question in this connection.
That is my guiding principle.
It is evident that the means are desperately lacking.
This figure is wrong.
This is a very important point.
Why do we send calves from Sweden to Holland?
Clearly there is an answer to these questions.
Someone has to pay.
The question is simply: who?
Who is to pay for animal welfare?
Who is to pay for the countryside?
Mr Kindermann spoke about the responsibility that man has.
I share this opinion.
It does so through the office in Dublin.
Mr Maat talked about vaccination and exports.
This conference will hopefully be held during the autumn.
He also addressed the matter of chemicals policy.
I think this is a very good ambition.
Mrs Maes spoke about the inspection trips.
We have a moral responsibility to treat animals well.
Cruelty to animals is unworthy of us humans.
It is an issue of particular complexity.
This is not an unreasonable apprehension.
I fully agree.
Information and communication technologies in developing countries
In addition to this, there is ICT.
This is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.
There is also a need for private enterprises.
A similar commitment within ICT is imperative.
But what about 'e-development' ?
This requires a targeted strategy.
Let me underline the following points.
At first glance, the answer is no.
That should not happen.
That is why a European strategy must be developed.
This is a realistic approach.
For the Commission, this is a fundamental point.
Mrs DybkjÃ¦r's report is well timed.
This proposal would run counter to it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Export and return of cultural goods
We can, however, draw certain conclusions.
We also face other problems, however.
We need to start in Europe, however.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 8.55 p.m.)
I must start with a regrettable announcement.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
I would like to see these included.
We have taken note of that too.
I checked this out.
That will be investigated, Mr Posselt.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Vote on requests for urgent procedure
(Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure)
(Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure)
We did not receive early notification.
We have only had the texts since Friday.
Accordingly, we recommend the rejection of this request.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
European Food Authority
You cannot have the one without the other.
This authority is primarily concerned with food safety.
Everything has to be seen through this focus.
They are all there in due measure.
But they are not there in the title.
We go for merit every time.
We go for openness.
We go for transparency.
We think ultimate responsibility must rest with the Commission.
My own scepticism remains.
I commend this report to the House.
This is why we must expedite our preparatory work.
There is a desire to keep the authority independent.
He has done a great job.
This is addressed by Amendment No 208.
We can delay this no longer.
The very nature of fisheries has implications for traceability.
Keep the number to 12.
I should like to thank him for this.
First of all, there is safety.
Secondly, quality.
Fifthly, independence.
But what is a fair price for healthy food?
Europe has a rapidly growing food sector.
This also reduces the risk of infection.
They have both acquitted themselves of their tasks marvellously.
I would call for further development in the future.
Let that be a warning to the Authority!
Have we forgotten all this?
Despite which, it will be a valuable service.
However, I have one reservation.
Will it be yet another European technocratic unit?
These matters are important to citizens.
Openness and appointments based on merit are essential.
Nothing else would be acceptable to us.
The seat of the authority has frequently been discussed.
I also welcome Commissioner Byrne.
We must be able to trust them.
It is all about balance.
It must have good transport and communications connections.
This policy should be maintained.
But responsibility should also be clearly defined.
The rapid alert system must remain a political instrument.
Emotions can run high where food is concerned.
The stakes are therefore high.
The consumer has lost a great deal of confidence.
I hope that this project will be a success.
Inspections cannot turn unsafe food into safe food.
Safe food must be produced.
We must adopt them as a matter of urgency.
This hypocrisy has to stop.
This is not proposed out of malice.
This is not proposed out of mischief.
It is proposed out of principle.
What signal do we want to give?
A number of amendments refer to food hygiene.
Hence we can only partially accept Amendment No 49.
There are no such factors at this time.
This brings me to Amendment No 1.
We cannot accept Amendment No 91 for operational reasons.
This is a legal impossibility.
The other criteria are not acceptable.
Amendment No 215 is not acceptable.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Animal by-products
Category 1 covers risk material.
Implementation in particular will be difficult.
I would ask you to think this through.
We must not manipulate it a second time.
This would be devastating for public health.
First of all, let me thank Mrs Paulsen.
And let me also thank Commissioner Byrne.
Public confidence has been destroyed.
That did not work because of cross-contamination.
My worry is about cross-contamination.
Amendment No 100 facilitates this continued ban.
The same applies to foot-and-mouth.
We introduced strict controls.
Alkaline hydrolysis is one such method.
This will cause these areas unnecessary costs.
Directives do not prevent natural cannibalism in animals.
This Regulation is of crucial importance.
The sector will hopefully take that chance.
The current rules and checks must be strictly applied.
Omnivores really will eat everything.
We should not try to re-educate them.
I cannot overemphasise the importance of this proposal.
We are faced with a very stark choice.
They have to be disposed of and processed.
The reason is obvious.
The proposal will achieve this objective.
Two different definitions of remote areas are proposed.
We could accept a combination of both.
It is unrealistic.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Ozone in ambient air
I can understand that.
Such is the case with air pollution.
Problems remain.
In severe circumstances people die.
This does not sound too bad a compromise.
I also understand that meteorological conditions vary.
The first is the relationship with the applicant countries.
My group is able to support all the amendments.
It refuses to go any further.
We do want to go further.
(Applause)

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Whitehead report (A5-0198/2001)
So you are talking about a European Food Authority?
I was therefore delighted to vote in favour.
That is logical.
.
.
I voted in favour of this report.
.
I feel hungry.
And I ate some excellent hot dogs!
We know the rest.
For this reason, I abstained in the vote.
Karamanou report (A5-0206/2001)
We strongly condemn child pornography.
.
, in writing.
We strongly condemn child pornography.
.
This is why we are abstaining from the vote.
.
.
Or have these rules been changed again?
Is that clear?
Thank you for your answer.
Klamt report (A5-0183/2001)
And he thanked me.
In reality, however, this is an alibi.
.
.
This brings out the worst in people.
.
.
DybkjÃ¦r report (A5-0191/2001)
'Ah!' she exclaimed.
'No' I explained.
In fact I have voted in favour.
The people are demanding democracy, are they?
Let them make do with the Internet!
Aparicio SÃ¡nchez report (A5-0122/2001)
They have never been shown in our museums.'
That concludes the vote.
Ozone in ambient air (continuation)
Without these changes the legislation will be toothless.
I congratulate Mr Davies on his excellent report.
In such conditions, what can we do?
Amendment No 11 would be acceptable in part.
Amendment No 17, in principle.
There are four amendments on other issues.
Thank you very much, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
WTO Panel/Section 211
It is about the extraterritorial application of domestic legislation.
Why is this so important?
These desires have been examined and assessed very carefully.
We largely agree on the substance of this issue.
I broadly agree.
Again, under normal circumstances, I would agree.
Some Members of this Parliament feel it was irresponsible.
It is not an issue of reforming Article 133.
We receive no minutes of these meetings.
There is no formal dialogue between us.
We have an Intergovernmental Conference coming up in 2004.
Let us return to the discussion then.
The Council has demonstrated that we want dialogue.
I can only regret this.
We therefore observed the procedures entirely correctly.
That is the first point.
Thank you for the initiative of your diplomats.
(The President cut the speaker off)
When I arrived, the door was already closed.
I know nothing about any other meeting.
Thank you very much, Mr Danielsson.
The debate is closed.
ASEM process
Allow me to make one additional comment.
We are in the business of helping each other.
We should maintain a balance.
That is why the committee's idea...
(The President cut the speaker off)
We have not reached that stage yet.
That will bring Asia and Europe closer together.
Those interests are mainly in the economic field.
However, we should not neglect the safety aspects.
Asia cannot be compared to the European Union.
There are major paradoxes.
The region is not served by organised silence.
Their presence did not reveal any sense of involvement.
It is, of course, understandable.
But that is another matter.
This is an important point, in our view.
We did find Mr Dupuis' original report exciting.
This is clearly problematic.
I should like to make a second point.
These conflicts have complicated root causes.
That is not the point.
This opens up huge possibilities.
We addressed a multitude of issues.
That is why we have proposed to cluster activities.
We shared a sort of post-candlelight supper together.
I could have talked about Japan.
I could have talked about South-East Asia.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Development of the external service
Firstly, there is the need to move quickly.
This resistance must be broken down.
Thirdly, there is the problem of horizontal redeployment.
Even the European Court of Auditors criticises this.
Mr President, I welcome the Galeote report.
.
Let me offer a number of observations.
Deconcentration concepts have been established for each major programme.
Staff requirements have been assessed for each delegation.
The second session is starting this autumn.
I hope the message is clear.
But it is a long haul.
Ambition depends on two things.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken on Thursday at noon.
I shall quote a few examples.
We have got rid of some categories.
It is more simple, less complicated.
They are not affected by this proposal.
I have a few questions.
I also have a question about the longer term.
We are therefore increasing the incentive here.
This was already included in the previous proposal.
Has the Commission already considered this?
Can you say anything more about this?
The others are being examined.
Why is it not a longer list?
In my opinion there are two reasons.
We are making quite good progress here.
Thank you Commissioner.
That concludes this item.
Question Time (Council)
We shall look at questions to the Council.
Question No 1 by (H-0437/01):
If not, why not?
I will be very brief.
Question No 2 by (H-0439/01):
Has Turkey made a start in moving towards them?
The European Union makes greater demands than that.
That is hardly surprising.
I do have some understanding for the time aspect.
Question No 3 by (H-0444/01):
The Council is already monitoring these issues.
Question No 4 by(H-0446/01):
Question No 5 by (H-0453/01):
Ireland has said no to the Treaty of Nice.
The honourable Member is bringing up a separate issue.
Question No 6 by (H-0456/01):
That is what I call a short answer.
This is remarkable.
I wonder who does have responsibility.
The European Council in itself is a Council issue.
Question No 7 by (H-0483/01):
Those arrested had to identify themselves to the police.
Nor have I seen any denial on their part.
Can we have any information on this matter?
Question No 9 by (H-0462/01):
What are you going to do?
It is a great result for the Swedish Presidency.
Question No 11 by (H-0469/01):
Question No 12 by (H-0486/01):
I can only briefly repeat what was said then.
Thank you for your answer.
This is often the argument used against it.
We are probably in agreement on these goals.
Question No 15 by (H-0479/01):
I thank the Council for its reply.
Question No 16 by (H-0481/01):
Thank you very much for your reply.
Question No 17 by (H-0482/01):
My reply will be quite short.
The Presidency has not yet received any such request.
Question No 19 by (H-0487/01):
Question No 21 by (H-0490/01):
I would like a response on that.
Belgium will be taking over the presidency after Sweden.
Protection of Community forests
In other words, EUR 10 million per year.
Parliament is requesting EUR 0.23 per hectare.
The difference is EUR 0.07 per hectare.
That is to say, investment.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Simplifying conditions for invoicing in respect of VAT
The other aspect concerns electronic signatures.
Why do I say this?
This innovation is therefore welcome.
My Group will support it.
The preliminary report was also a good one.
Usually only the opposite approach is possible.
At the moment this figure is 10%.
So the significance is far from small.
Using advanced electronic signatures must not be compulsory.
Two problems have been pinpointed.
Various speakers have already drawn attention to that tonight.
In most cases it is very restrictive.
Electronic invoicing is sometimes not possible at all.
I thank Parliament and the rapporteur very much indeed.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I shall therefore give the floor to Mrs Laguiller.
Thank you for allowing me to speak.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Termination of service of Commission officials
It does need to be seen in that context.
They will not be on the EPP voting list.
We have a consensus on that.
That is a recognition of our dual role.
We also believe that it is cost-neutral.
To conclude, my verdict is positive.
However, I do not support the Ferber amendments.
We therefore welcome them very warmly.
There are three reasons for that.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Universal service in electronic communications
They anticipate technical development.
We all know the ways of the market.
We have seen it happen.
We already have competition.
It of course requires planned funding.
Allow me to make five observations.
That would seem wrong to me.
Set top boxes must be compatible with each other.
A common interface is required for that purpose.
This is legislated for excellently in Annex 6.
We must pledge our support for this.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
These considerations are reflected in this report.
Balance in this report is important.
Amendments Nos 45 and 46 are welcome in principle.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Structural business statistics
I believe that is something more.
Mrs Lulling has also referred to environmental issues.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Silicone breast implants
Nobody would listen to her.
They treated her somewhat as an eccentric.
I congratulate Parliament and the Petitions Committee.
I cannot stress that too strongly.
That information has to be available from independent sources.
We also talk about registration.
My group supports these proposals.
It is now subject to internal Commission consultation procedures.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
Certainly, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez.
I call Mrs Lindh, President-in-Office of the Council.
The whole internal market area has fallen into place.
We have also developed work on preventing armed conflict.
In Southern Serbia, developments are more positive.
(Applause)
Every referendum tells a story.
That is not the point.
(Applause)
Firstly, sustainable development.
Moving on to my second subject: enlargement.
It must happen now for the time is ripe.
The most sensitive chapters are now open.
But this is not all.
(Applause)
We must send out this message.
We must also be flexible.
We are currently debating the Structural Funds.
A minority of 300 000 people live there.
(Applause)
Now to Ireland.
Then we shall see what needs to be done.
(Applause)
We have come a long way together.
(Applause)
Our group values partnership and friendship with America.
We urge you to represent this position clearly.
(Noise, heckling)
That is why he is right on this count.
(Applause)
Please help to bring it about.
(Applause)
That is how things are done.
That is a serious issue.
After that there will eventually be a second referendum.
In this context I must make a personal confession.
My group says a definitive no to this trend.
We want to focus on the alternatives.
These can no longer be addressed behind closed doors.
So this backlash is hardly surprising.
The Treaty of Nice has come to nothing.
There is nothing else about enlargement in the Treaty.
What should it decide?
But we should also examine ourselves.
There is another summit being held.
The leadership must focus on what unites us.
All this is required for sustainable development.
But we must also act globally.
War is better in a media society.
President Bush is coming to Gothenburg.
The other major environmental problem in Europe is traffic.
The summit must stake out such a path.
There must be a good result.
This means that the Treaty of Nice has failed.
This is not democratic fiddle-faddle.
But what they voted on was the Nice Treaty.
The Irish people have spoken.
The answer is "no".
We must respect that decision.
Please be careful.
The list is endless - take your pick.
The jury is out.
Those two things are not incompatible.
Do not listen to him!
The Nice result is not an outburst of Euro-scepticism.
I did not know how that decision was made.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That comes home to roost at critical moments.
And Friday was certainly not the first time.
It is disquieting.
The Gothenburg Summit has to be the starting point.
It will not surprise you that I welcome this.
The Irish lesson is a good one.
Thank you Ireland.
We have always maintained that.
That is the litmus test for Europe.
This is the French text:
Thank you.
Denmark has already ratified the Treaty.
That is not acceptable.
That is not so.
So exactly how do things stand right now?
That is taking a huge risk.
They must not be denied that right.
We now need a sustained debate on Nice.
That is a disgracefully long time.
Why are they acting so cowardly?
And I also want to acknowledge this.
I believe that you have acted with political care.
The Nice Treaty must in time cease to exist.
First and foremost, sustainability.
And now a couple of words about enlargement.
We must be careful of rhetoric.
We must take the referendum result seriously.
Naturally, this work must continue.
(Applause)
My answer relates to the Commission's statements.
Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
We have concluded this morning' s debates.

No, that is not at all the case.

These linguistic shenanigans are in fact political points.
That is obvious.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Gothenburg European Council
The wording of paragraph 23 is therefore incorrect.
Madam President, I voted against this resolution.
I do not support the militarisation of Europe.
I feel the point was not made strongly enough.
It seemed to accept the missile defence system.
I voted "against".
Basques, Corsicans, Sardinians, etc.
That is quite undemocratic and most regrettable.
.
But these individual explanations do not suffice.
.
Not one political party campaigned against enlargement.
Only one non-party organisation did so.
They must not be denied that right.
.
.
.
.
.
Let us not be under any illusions, however.
to fully stop the depletion of biodiversity by 2010;
to adopt legislation on allocating environmental responsibility by 2003;
.
This is why we have abstained in the vote.
.
.
Harbour report (A5-0202/2001)
Lulling report (A5-0181/2001)
Because, if not, something needs to change.
Torres Marques report (A5-0149/2001)
Miller report (A5-0194/2001)
.
That is why we abstained on this report.
Brok report (A5-0207/2001)
Make way for the young people of those countries!
Fourtou report (A5-0186/2001)
Yet the resolution also has a very negative aspect.
I therefore abstain on this resolution.
You don't use them, do you?"
"What are you saying?" she replied.
.
.
I have voted against the proposal.
Working time in mobile road-transport activities
We cannot exclude the self-employed.
However, even this poses difficulties.
Therefore, that is also an important point.
Mr President, we support this directive.
Why?
Secondly, competition.
This figure is increasing by 20% per year.
Of course they are.
Why forget about the majority?
Let us be serious.
Independent workers are not another race.
Thirdly, there is sufficient national legislation.
Even the Common Position is giving this due consideration.
There are other reasons for long delays.
That has little to do with health and safety.
I cannot explain those rules to the voter.
That was mentioned a moment ago.
The sector is repeatedly up to new tricks.
That would not be the first one.
We have already closed the Willy Betz loophole.
This has been a relatively long time coming.
Our group has tabled two amendments.
I am sure that is true.
These last three sentences are not my words.
We shall not be alone.
I cannot believe that they will agree to this.
There are areas that are open to improvement.
We have a fast growing economy.
It depends on a flexible and innovative transport industry.
This is not something we should agree with.
I believe that the Directive must include self-employed workers.
It is a tribute to his political skill.
In my opinion Parliament should also approve this compromise.
I should also like to thank Mrs Sanders-ten Holte.
This is now given fresh relevance.
Surely they can understand that.
He was quite right.
That said, let us get to the point.
The Andrea Doria is approaching New York.
Why?
You have no right to reply.
Please have no doubt that that is my position.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Maritime traffic
Mr President, Commissioner, this problem is double-edged.
That happens far too little at the moment.
We must legislate for that.
Thirdly, the black box.
Each port or each ship is different.
It is dangerous.
We must therefore do something about this.
We have added a provision to that effect.
Fifthly, ports of refuge.
The proposal will now be presented to the Council.
The real safety work is done at sea.
, rapporteur.
This really is urgently necessary.
We must assume our responsibilities.
(The President cut the speaker off)
So we have tabled the relevant proposed amendments.
We consider this to be absolutely self-evident.
It is a good idea.
We think this is the right way forward.
The Commission seems suspicious of its own proposal.
Now to the proposed amendments.
I will confine my remarks to the EsclopÃ© report.
(heckling: or Greifswald, Rostock)
Back to today.
I can therefore support most elements in this package.
The navigation system is an important element.
Therefore, this extension does not receive my backing.
Did he underestimate the scale of the disaster?
By contrast, our other leaders were very active.
Compensation of victims is almost non-existent.
Compensating the victims?
The maritime safety of our countries?
Yet, the threats are not only environmental.
We would therefore support the Commission's proposal.
We want action and we want it now.
We regret that.
These amendments therefore seem tainted and absurd.
It is these tragedies that underlie this decision.
We also have an open mind about international regulations.
One last comment on the Mastorakis report.
That is a contradiction in terms.
My second comment relates to the content.
The first aspect is the emptying of tanks.
What is going to be done about this?
The third point concerns controls.
No one could say!
Beyond this, many other risks remain.
I think that Lisbon is probably the most appropriate.
But it entails a great deal of responsibility.
That alone was cause for concern.
We could apply this model here too.
Greek justice is taking action.
I believe we must mark out territories.
We are not prepared to accept this.
The perfect is the enemy of the good.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Occurrence reporting in civil aviation
That is why I welcome this European Commission proposal.
My third point referred to Article 4.
It was a great pleasure to work with him.
Question Time (Commission)
We shall now take questions to the Commission.
Part one
Question No 32 by (H-0455/01):
We also carry out Food-for-Work projects.
Even in shelter programmes women are involved.
Yesterday, they came here to Parliament once again.
Question No 33 by (H-0473/01):
.
I will try to explain.
There are a number of points we consider important.
I will name just a few.
The Commission does not have access to additional resources.
We have a specific budget.
We cannot.
This is crucial.
So, does it improve delivery?
We have had enough empty donor-driven manifestations.
The reality is not so easy.
I appreciate the response from Mr Wijkman.
It is true that these organisations need money.
We will come to this in the next question.
That is how we mobilise additional money.
I should like to ask him two supplementary questions.
This is a highly significant point.
This is the real issue.
This was the main contribution of our action programme.
I therefore welcome the contribution concerning TB.
Question No 35 by (H-0461/01):
How will the farmers be able to resist this?
Only the remainder was used in feedingstuffs.
Question No 36 by (H-0470/01):
Commissioner, you have not answered my question.
You reply in a theoretical and impersonal way.
That is a fact.
We will continue to work towards this in Parliament.
But my question has a different aim.
They give names.
Is that correct, Mr Varela?
I see.
Part of the negotiations involved earmarking these funds.
Question No 37 by (H-0445/01):
Thank you for your response, Commissioner.
I hope so too.
Question time is closed.
Occurrence reporting in civil aviation (continuation)
The proposed measure has a strongly preventive character.
That is the purport of Amendment No 11.
Safety precautions are essential.
The majority of accidents are due to human factors.
To be honest, I cannot understand it.
Thank you very much, Commissioner de PalÃ¡cio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Work equipment
No type of administration should be outside this commitment.
A third point is training.
Legislation alone cannot prevent accidents of this kind.
Thank you very much, Mrs ThorningÂ­Schmidt.
What should the EU deal with?
This might be at a national or local level.
I think we need some new thinking.
This directive has finally provided a solution.
That is precisely where the whole problem lies.
But they are all getting excited about nothing.
For the time being, anyway.
I am only highlighting this issue.
We have not solved the problem.
The directive causes problems of enforceability.
There is room for more clarity in this respect.
.
We can thank the chauffeurs' service of Parliament.
It is a first.
That may stagger you, but it is true.
It is true for various reasons.
But sense prevailed and now we have it back.
Five hundred thousand people each year fall from heights.
That is quite a burden for business.
I worked at heights.
I worked on scaffolding.
I worked on ladders.
I have seen it.
Parliament has been incredibly successful in this process.
It has been successful for many reasons.
These are not burdens.
It seems remarkable that this could be so misrepresented.
Not all the amendments came from the Socialists.
Let us not forget that.
You are criticising your own colleagues as well.
This is a very successfully arranged piece of legislation.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner de PalÃ¡cio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
European Union's oil supply
Could we perhaps waste a little time?
Thirdly, Europe is totally dependent on oil imports.
This, of course, will exacerbate inflationary pressures.
(The President cut the speaker off)
, rapporteur.
What exactly is my point here?
Obviously, people are getting used to higher prices.
Not with fifteen, with one.
But more can still be done.
Our group supports the main points of the report.
I agree on the importance of far-sighted policies.
What is even more important is the transport sector.
We need to develop a new generation of vehicles.
The report makes very welcome proposals here.
However, this is easier said than done.
There are solutions other than price management.
I should like to pick up on four points.
I support that paragraph.
These both have to be a sensible approach.
There is no such thing.
The rapporteur proposes more energy-efficient windows.
That is a good saving.
It would save 20% of oil.
What next?
Transporting energy is one problem.
I support local forms of energy.
These are the right solutions.
Renewable energy sources are not sufficiently fast.
This cooperation would work and would secure energy provision.
And this is the subject of this report.
Protection of pigs
Just the subject for a midnight debate.
We have also tightened up the rules on training.
Mr Busk touched on two or three important issues.
I will reiterate them very quickly.
One of them was transport of animals.
My second point concerns the Commission.
But what about the implications for consumers?
I wanted to make this quite clear.
Mr Busk made an excellent job of that.
We could talk about this topic ad infinitum.
But it is and remains just a compromise.
But I think this is the most practical solution.
Now to the report.
My many years' experience confirms precisely that.
Many of our proposed amendments refer to slot widths.
We almost make out that we are experts here.
I think others are far better placed to judge.
That is the fact of the matter.
Castration not performed correctly results in constant pain.
The Commission is not blind to these implications.
That is 3.3 times the cost.
These amendments cannot be accepted.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo
(Laughter, heckling: cynic!)
How representative will these elections be?
I refer to the Deutschmark.
FYROM, Kosovo, former Yugoslavia.
We must find a way out of this impasse.
It is most strange.
And that is what we must secure.
Last year, the funding was 50-50.
I would like to comment on each of them.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
We are not doing this at the moment.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, on a point of order.
I think he has the matter well in hand.
The terms of the Treaty make it quite clear.
Thank you, Mr Bourlanges.
This appears to contravene French legislation.
Thank you, Mrs Klamt.
We will deal with the matter.
So we had half an hour to spare.
Thank you very much, Mr Corbett.
Structural measures
II.
III.
Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
It was therefore a totally reasonable proposal.
Community support must be strengthened and not reduced;
I urge everyone here today to support this amendment.
One way or another fleet capacity must be reduced.
This is a fundamental issue for fishing in RÃ©union.
Now to the agricultural part of the POSEI programme.
So what are the most important considerations?
Now briefly to the fisheries reports.
The first two proposed amendments concern the legal basis.
I can accept the third proposed amendment.
These problems were raised during the debate.
I can accept Amendments Nos 7 and 8.
Then briefly to Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez's report.
I think this is justified for social reasons.
Thank you.
I entirely agree.
Something needs to be done about it.
It sets a disgraceful example.
VOTE
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Galeote Quecedo (PPE-DE).
Thank you, that was clear and helpful.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)President.
That concludes the vote.

Report Linkohr (A5-0163/2001)
Are we perhaps in Italy, Mr President?
No.
We have therefore voted against this report.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Direct support schemes under the CAP
I think Mr Cunha will be addressing this point.
Otherwise we might be encouraging absenteeism.
This is fundamental.
The CAP aid schemes needed simplifying.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur.
I see this as a very important point.
Now to the individual proposed amendments.
I can confirm that.
You said we would need another hundred million.
In other words they are minute.
That is another kettle of fish, however.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Biological and toxins weapons convention
Then we shall be able to resolve these problems.
That mechanism is required urgently.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in the Central African Republic
There is more to it than that, however.
Unfortunately Europe is looking on indecisively and passively.
They help to strengthen dictators, not democrats.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
Guatemala
That is what is threatening to happen now.
Punishment is not always the crucial factor.
What is crucial is to bring out the truth.
It will not do so without sufficient international support.
Electoral fraud in Chad
Nor are the European Cotonou resources unconditional.
The elections appear to have been heavily rigged.
The European Union should insist on this.
All these questions must be answered and accounted for.
Is Idriss Deby in fact a new oil dictator ?
In Chad it turned into a real electoral hold-up.
Voting cards were distributed.
They were sold.
In short, we cannot accept such a travesty.
We simply cannot take this.
I should like to pay tribute to him.
Egypt
The case of Mrs El Saadawi is typical.
I would nevertheless remind you that divorce...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Unfortunately there is still no internal stability.
Egypt is still far from being a democracy.
People are imprisoned without trial and tortured.
Show trials are still held.
Stability means something else besides stripping people of rights.
That is what is important.
The reason for this draconian measure?
The reason is plain.
Nevertheless Selim has so far visited Israel seven times.
However, author Selim went further.
In short, Selim's exclusion was inevitable.
Certainly it is premature, as Mr Dary said.
That is one of the this case.
An answer please, Commissioner.
Malaysia
It is based on respect for the law.
It is also an important country economically.
If I have misunderstood, please do enlighten me.
Afghanistan
This is a daily occurrence in Afghanistan.
Accordingly our group is submitting two amendments.
The current situation is difficult.
What are we to do?
We need to review it again.
They, too, need our support.
These are some of the measures that are needed.
One feels really powerless.
We need a more intelligent policy in this sphere.
The Commission is closely monitoring the situation there.
There are also limited possibilities for an appeal.
The situation is being carefully monitored by the Commission.
The overall situation is complex and not entirely clear.
They noted a reluctance to consider new peace initiatives.
Two things are clear concerning the future of Afghanistan.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Nepal
I think that says it all.
The facts on today's Nepal.
What this country needs now is enlightenment.
As of today the situation remains volatile.
Our commitment stands firm.
It should be published before the summer break.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in Angola
There are the new minefields.
What cynicism!
That was not our intention.
Let us listen to the Angolans.
They know more and better than we do.
The Angolans want peace.
These are the voices we must listen to.
There is no military solution to this conflict.
The situation of Angola is a tragic situation.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Civil emergency protection
This mechanism therefore has to be very welcome.
I refer here to Amendments Nos 1 and 13.
The Commission rejects Amendment No 17.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Classical swine fever
I therefore cannot accept Amendment No 35.
Amendment No 37 seeks to achieve a similar objective.
We have now banned swill in the UK entirely.
However, greater importance should be attached to vaccination.
Another important point is the principle of regionalisation.
Now third countries must return the favour.
That is a problem.
I myself come from Flanders.
This Parliament speaks with two voices!
When will this Parliament start listening to its citizens?
There has to be a better way.
The people of the European Union are demanding this.
I do not believe we have.
Thank you, honourable Members.
I share the concern of the Parliament.
Their co-ordination must be guaranteed to ensure proper eradication.
In these cases, drafting changes are also needed.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
EEC/Comoros fisheries agreement
The cost distribution of the agreement is also changed.
He had our full support.
But we have some reservations.
These vessels catch 40 000 tonnes of fish.
That is my main concern.
Nevertheless I support the report.
Mr President, honourable Members.
A brief word on the proposed amendments.
Unfortunately, I cannot agree to Amendment No 5.
Finally, I cannot accept Amendment No 7.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
VOTE

That is your prerogative, Mr Sylla.

The aim was more meat and cheaper meat.
Yet this obvious safety measure is not taken.
International trade demands meat from non-vaccinated animals.
What a fine Parliament!
You speak a little too much, however.
You should not give so many explanations of vote.'
Mother will always be mother.
Just for today!
(Applause and laughter)
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 7.00 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Membership of political groups
He will now sit with the Non-attached Members.
I therefore propose to confirm these mandates.
I only have information about Mr Holmes.
Agenda
Relating to Wednesday:
Unless the chairs of the groups decide otherwise.
(The order of business was adopted)
Speeches relating to procedure
I would like to make this extreme inconvenience known.
The flight was once again cancelled.
I should like to draw your attention to this.
I therefore call on you to intervene.
(Applause)
Madam President, I will be very brief.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Mr Dupuis is quite right.
Let us please put an end to this nonsense.
Helping FYROM or Macedonia in its present state.
That is what Parliament should be doing.
Resale rights
I do not think so.
Anything lower would seriously hamper budding artists.
This brings me to my next point of criticism.
Surely that cannot be the aim of the exercise.
Provision is made for all kinds of unnecessary exceptions.
Harmonisation has therefore gone out of the window.
Then there is implementation.
Artists do not welcome this either.
That is not the only example I could quote.
The directive is unclear and is not fraud-proof.
My group does not welcome legislation of this kind.
My group has voted against it twice.
It is they who assume the major risk.
Who will then buy the works of unknown artists?
Moreover, the rapporteur is also to be congratulated.
A further deadline is cited by way of supplement.
But these messages cannot be disseminated without artists.
Everyone stands to gain from this solution.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Better legal protection for accident victims
What are we proposing?
Who is liable?
Those are only some of the proposals.
I consider that to be a modern concept.
The Commission should therefore set to work.
That is important.
It deserves proper and transparent treatment.
This must stop.
Having to re-insure and re-register can be such hindrances.
The legislation was adopted last year.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes
Secondly, is the system coherent and efficient?
This brings me to the amendments.
They could not function without that.
We cannot offer our citizens a second-rate service.
It comes in two forms.
We see examples of this across Europe.
This is vital.
But the consumer may also be dissatisfied at times.
That is deplorable.
The Netherlands plans to launch these in 2001.
Justice delayed is justice denied.
A new information technology age has arrived.
I congratulate the rapporteur on this fine report.
I see the EEJ Net initiative as a priority.
That is desirable and included in our proposal.
The others seem to me to be perfectly reasonable.
So the Commission fully supports this.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
COM in fruit and vegetables
The report in question is essentially descriptive.
There are, therefore, two problems.
This is not reflected either.
Quite the opposite is true.
Why not consider direct aid?
So I too am adamant.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
This balanced management is based on four elements.
Secondly, rules relating to the occupation of land.
We are here to talk.
We hope that they take the same view.
I am left with a few questions.
I welcome this.
Who lays down the standards?
Does the European Union have a say in this?
Can we be stricter?
How do we go about this?
What is happening about competition between airports?
What will be the role of the local authorities?
So how will you tackle this?
Then there is the phase-out.
I also have a question on air pollution.
You have said very little on this matter.
What is stipulated in the air pollution agreement?
Is it being repealed?
Have the Americans commented on this at all?
So what does Parliament expect from this ICAO meeting?
Aircraft should fulfil ambitious but feasible emission reduction targets.
I wish the Commissioner great success in the negotiations.
Firstly: the improvement of aircraft.
We must achieve some concrete and quantifiable objectives.
Finally, it is also a question of infrastructure.
I find that disappointing.
We gave you a brief in March 2000.
Successful negotiation requires preparation and hard work.
We need you to stick to your brief.
We will be watching very closely.
We expect you do it.
They do not.
We must see the beginning of change.
I join with other colleagues who have spoken.
This is clear: airports are necessary.
We have to see things fairly.
It will be in order to make improvements.
That is the current situation.
We will have to wait and see the result.
There are two different aspects to this.
That is the origin of our complaint about hushkits.
Ladies and gentlemen, everything has its limits.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.59 p.m.)
The next item is the joint debate on:
There is a further demanding task.
Instead, we adopted the strategy of taking action.
It is an undervalued factor in external relations.
We have also said that Russia is not enough.
Russia is just one important factor.
That was incredibly important.
That is important.
When we act together, we exercise influence.
That is the signal.
Perhaps matters are not progressing quickly enough.
On the other hand, we have the processes.
I am obviously not completely satisfied.
We obtained a compromise along the right lines.
Instead, there will be a broader debate.
Let it be just such a broad debate.
How is this to happen?
What is that development to look like?
What is possible in an enlarged Union?
The Union will grow.
That is something we now know following this presidency.
Thank you for your constructive cooperation.
The process is now irrevocable.
That is important progress.
First of all, climate change.
Secondly: public health.
Fourthly, the transport system.
These four areas demand decisive leadership and rapid intervention.
That is what sustainable development is about.
(Applause from the centre and right)
(Applause from the centre and right)
But now for a critical comment.
You spoke about Fascist forces.
(Applause)
Mr President-in-Office, let me make one more observation.
We should continue to follow this path.
I say that on behalf of all of us.
I wish Sweden a positive future in Europe.
(Applause)
Many people demonstrated peacefully in Nice and in GÃ¶teborg.
That determination has been handsomely rewarded.
I know it was a delicate issue.
I congratulate you on it.
I have one or two other brief comments.
The peace remains delicate.
That may well be felt to be very regrettable.
EU leaders must assume a global responsibility too.
The Treaty of Nice was to remain in place.
Sometimes, compromises have been made at any price.
The presidency has worked hard on enlargement.
That alone is difficult enough.
Parliament is now bringing legal proceedings against the Council.
This is something from which we must learn.
People with hoods on must be expelled from demonstrations.
The objectives were ambitious.
It was others who were putting the brakes on.
I should like to say the same.
The Swedish presidency had three important and major ambitions.
A number of new objectives were set.
That, if anything, is a success.
I also want to say something about global responsibility.
Turning now to the debate about the future.
Should there be a convention?
Yes, but a convention is not enough.
We cannot begin with the institutional issues.
In that way, the institutional issues come last.
Turning next to Ireland.
Finally, a word about the riots.
Putting this into practice has huge implications.
We need a new approach.
Unfortunately, the results have been somewhat disappointing.
It needs to be purposeful and result-oriented.
The final balance is very positive.
First of all enlargement.
I should like to thank you for this.
That is unacceptable.
Quite the contrary.
May we never betray his memory.
I believe that that attention is justified.
What are the options left to those mediating parties?
They excel in wishful thinking.
Not at all!
Every institution has its own president.
Expectations are raised too high.
This is wonderful news!
I share his view.
But, Mr President, paper can wait.
We have heard too much idle talk.
This chatter is no longer acceptable or even believable.
It is also expensive.
Mr President, I witnessed the violence at GÃ¶teborg.
Nice is not essential for enlargement.
We support the right to demonstrate.
We are against violence.
These militant hooligans often call themselves anti-fascists.
That is their own way of describing themselves.
Their whole way of addressing politics is fascistic.
That is the lesson to be learned from GÃ¶teborg.
This is the way we have operated.
I strongly support what Mr Corbett said.
They are detailed.
That is more or less where I stand.
It is a consequence of our promoting human rights.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Takeover bids
Parliament offered all kinds of compromises during the negotiations.
That is the clear consequence of this.
The Americans have gone in exactly the opposite direction.
No one has anything against protecting shareholders.
I am a shareholder myself.
That is the key problem.
That is why it must be rejected.
The history is therefore important in this case.
We had to take a decision.
In other words: one man, one vote.
Then we had conciliation.
The five years necessary to transpose ....
(The President cut the speaker off)
He did a marvellous job in very difficult circumstances.
Shareholders can act against the Wall Street sharks.
Shareholders will often also be employees.
The conciliation result represents a substantial compromise.
It would be shocking not to do so.
But they have far less at the moment.
None of this is law at the moment.
That must be included in the rules.
Information and consultation are also currently under discussion.
Not simply information, therefore, but also consultation.
That is what is happening on the one hand.
I quite definitely belong to the second group.
Things can change.
Article 9 only prohibits the legal protection structures.
Mr President, one final point.
That is not an argument, in my opinion.
It involves give and take on both sides.
It is worthless.
But we should let the Commissioner have his wish!
What did we achieve in conciliation?
There are minimum standards.
Defensive and frustrating action is possible with shareholder approval.
My delegation will vote for this directive.
Some fears have been expressed about the directive.
We shall produce this work by March 2002.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mr President, on a point of order.
We are all guilty of talking.
(Applause)
Thank you for your speech, Mr Beazley.
Mr President, on a point of order.
We shall now proceed to the vote.

ECB and the euro
The information campaign is progressing on schedule.
Many thanks, Mr Duisenberg, for your speech.
Welcome
Mr Toledo, welcome to this House.
ECB and the euro (continuation)
The European Central Bank is a very young institution.
They should also be issued four times a year.
The launch date is 1 January.
They can witness it for themselves.
That applies to all of us, in fact.
That is an effective way to discourage counterfeiting.
It benefits the public.
It can prevent a general sense of irritation.
We want to be trustworthy in that respect.
That is not how things work.
We would welcome a review of your decision.
It would also be a sign of wisdom.
I would like to make a few final points.
I would welcome your opinion on this matter.
The Paragraph in question is the ninth.
We want an independent Bank.
This is an essential point, in our view.
There is a desperate lack of good candidates.
You have gained a great deal of experience.
No, there is not.
Does this prevent us from discussing monetary policy?
It does not.
Last year, we had eleven such appearances.
It ensures that the changeover is spread out.
Those few days leave little scope for counterfeiting.
That would render conversions in January redundant.
This is the out-dated 'shield' theory.
Thank you very much for that.
We have made substantial progress on all fronts.
Lastly, businesses can give practical training.
Growth is declining and inflation is on the increase.
That cannot be altered now.
The third proposal relates to the accession countries.
However, we must remember the fundamentals.
The directive has taken twelve years to draw up.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I will then give Commissioner Solbes Mira the floor.
I am now giving Mr Duisenberg the floor.
I wish to add some points.
Many points were made about the resolution.
I agree with her completely.
The answer is "no".
In five countries it will occur within one day.
We encourage that.
Institutions for occupational retirement provision
Why is this directive needed?
What is this directive about?
It is a financial services directive.
This clarification is necessary.
Nor is it a compromise.
I would just like to list the key amendments.
That is not the case.
The third pillar has been regulated in the past.
The rapporteur has managed to achieve these objectives.
(The President cut the speaker off)
You are shifting this issue onto totally new ground.
This provides a demarcation from the third pillar.
That is why we tabled amendments on two aspects.
There is no provision for inter-sectoral mutualisations.
The guarantees of actual benefits are not organised.
Urgently needed reforms are constantly being postponed.
The debate is adjourned until 9 p.m.
What is the content of this communication?
I will expand on each of these axes.
Second is financial sustainability.
The third axis concerns the modernisation of pension systems.
What is the proposed procedure?
Why have an integrated approach?
Employment strategy is one example.
A second example is public finances.
What will the Commissioner do?
(The President cut the speaker off)
They will never talk about pensions!"
I hope that the Commissioner will agree with me.
I look forward to reading the communication.
I have a couple of questions.
This will become essential.
Mr President, there are two main issues here.
First, the transparency of the pension systems.
There are major problems in this area at present.
Clear information should be available on demand.
Those are questions which are no longer addressed here.
That has not been provided for in the plan.
And indeed, what we have heard is impressive.
We talk of decent pensions through complementary pillars.
So far so good.
The third question concerns the question of harmonised pensions.
These are problems common to all countries.
We also have common objectives.
Question Time (Commission)
We shall look at questions to the Commission.
Part 1
Question No 27 by (H-0541/01):
The short answer is 'no'.
The dates involved are negotiated dates.
Question No 29 by (H-0539/01):
We are awaiting a reply.
We will continue to press with this issue.
It is very important.
Question No 30 by (H-0546/01):
Second part
Preparatory work has progressed well since then.
This was an extremely full and helpful reply.
I am sure that Parliament is most appreciative.
That will need to be determined case-by-case and situation-by-situation.
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
Question No 31 by (H-0540/01):
Another issue is that of respecting procedural restrictions.
Therefore, this certainly shows political will.
That is a very good question.
Question No 32 by (H-0571/01):
Questions to Commissioner Solbes
This could, in fact, provoke a reaction.
This applies to the WTO' s current legislation.
It is preferable that I avoid disputes altogether.
Has there been any discussion on this?
Do you believe this is a possibility?
I will handle it.
This is our position.
From this perspective, it is quite straightforward.
This is the situation at the current time.
We are aware of your concerns in this area.
We support them, particularly from an ethical standpoint.
Question No 33 by (H-0565/01):
Thank you, Commissioner.
You have no official data.
This was the thrust of my question.
I think this updating exercise should already have begun.
I shall endeavour to reply to this second point.
Unemployment continues to fall.
Italy is included in both groups.
Question No 34 by (H-0578/01):
The problem of Montenegro is similar.
I would just like to ask a supplementary question.
You have raised a different problem.
But I thank you for your intervention.
Questions to Mr Monti
Question No 35 by (H-0535/01):
Yes, it has been a long period.
I agree with you about that.
That will depend on the facts.
Question No 36 by (H-0537/01):
And that is not acceptable, Commissioner.
Thank you very much, Mr Berenguer.
Question No 37 by (H-0551/01):
.
Question No 38 by (H-0557/01):
Is this your final opinion?
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Institutions for occupational retirement provision
I will concentrate on that issue.
Security can only come after that.
There is nothing new about that.
How should this be done?
No answer is given to this question.
In many countries, long qualification periods are applied.
Many countries have regulations involving double taxation.
How will this be solved?
There are a number of such questions.
A naÃ¯ve thought.
Government leaders have put pensions on their agendas.
Member States have followed suit and monitored each other.
That is anything but sufficient.
Help has now been given to financial markets.
All that remains is to help the people.
What are your plans in that connection?
I will not be part of that majority.
My criticisms relate above all to two issues.
There are three specific problems here.
That implies enormous risks in old age.
That problem has not been solved here.
I will put it in Aristotelian terms.
The average is five amendments per article.
Transferability must basically be governed at a national level.
A few amendments concern the scope of the directive.
I should like to conclude with the following remarks.
The ball is now in the Council's court.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Solvency margin for insurance undertakings
Things will no doubt hot up then!
This particularly applies to fast-track codecision procedures.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Electricity from renewable energy sources
I am firmly convinced of that.
Now let me turn to the key positive results.
She has made considerable progress.
We need other measures as well as this directive.
Congratulations again to Mrs Rothe.
Where should we focus our attention?
I can fully identify with this position.
This is a large proportion.
Other renewable sources of energy are difficult to find.
But more than anything, it is clean energy.
My sincere congratulations to the rapporteur.
It is sound work.
Secondly, large-scale investments are required.
That is wonderful, but unfortunately not enough.
We must remain realistic.
Firstly, the issue of biomass.
That is to say, including that biodegradable waste.
This is a key pioneering initiative.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Implementation of the Internet Top Level Domain ".EU
.
We have jointly made some very important recommendations.
Let me highlight some of the amendments.
Mrs Flesch and I had excellent cooperation.
We do not want to over-complicate it.
It has to justify its existence.
That is very important.
Two elements are crucial in this connection.
All interested organisations must be represented in the register.
Clear criteria are needed in that connection.
Europe is now acquiring a face, an address.
We will become ".EU".
We know that a lot has gone awry.
Just remember the "Amsterdam.nl" case.
E-commerce in the European Union will be promoted.
Two models are possible in this connection.
That is the right way forward in my view.
That is what Amendment No 24 is about.
Finally, my third point.
In Internet terms, it is a lifetime.
Mr Carraro also made comments which I endorse.
Why not this time a website?
Mr van Velzen mentioned Amendment No 34.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Radio spectrum policy
, rapporteur.
Firstly, strategic policy decisions have to be taken.
We are therefore talking about technical implementation measures here.
Amendment No 25 concerns transparency.
I believe that that is not the case.
It resembles one large patchwork at the moment.
What can we do?
That is why I propose a step-by-step plan.
Not easy, but it has to be done.
That is why I warmly recommend this amendment.
It is almost a little absurd.
We talk about technical implementation provisions.
In other words, the system is quite complicated.
That would be too much.
I often get complaints from CB users.
Mr Scheibenbogen writes to me regularly.
Article 7 is about publishing information.
In such cases, the codecision procedure is used.
The Commission is unable to approve any other amendments.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
Thank you, Mr Cossutta.
Mrs Thyssen, I have noted what you say.
Programme of the Belgian presidency
His expectations must also be met.
That was not the purpose of the euro.
That is the second main thrust of the presidency.
In fact, it is very simple.
(Applause)
Finally, food safety.
The Union must be enlarged as quickly as possible.
We must unite Europe.
We want to continue down that road.
First of all, the Balkans.
Then, there is the Middle East.
I am not going to dispute that.
I believe that our ambition should extend further.
Quite rightly so, too.
What precisely does European identity consist of?
What does it mean to people?
We need clear agreements.
Who does what at what level?
A radical simplification of those instruments is urgently necessary.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Laughter)
What is important are the following two matters.
Thank you for your attention.
(Loud applause)
I shall return to this subject shortly.
We have a duty to stop this trend.
This is a far-reaching debate with huge implications.
It is my unenviable privilege to share your concern.
This too is an issue the Convention must address.
Enlargement must not be compromised.
It has the unanimous backing of the Gothenburg Council.
No, it is not.
That is not the political point.
(Applause)
We have to be proactive in defending it.
(Applause)
You mentioned Laeken.
The European Parliament will be represented in the convention.
(Applause)
My third point is transparency.
We firmly support this.
(Applause)
You mentioned the work of the High Representative.
Our group has a high opinion of Mr Solana.
(Applause)
We support this.
You are a founding member of the European Union.
Belgium has already successfully completed eleven presidencies.
We are at your side!
(Applause)
We agree on the diagnosis of the specific problems.
Another basic element is the economic and social agenda.
You have asked for a coherent economic policy.
We need one.
Finally, Madam President, our international dimension.
We must consolidate what already exists.
That is one of our moral commitments.
There are ample reasons for this.
Prime Minister, an onerous task awaits you.
Future Member States were treated unfairly there.
You mentioned globalisation.
This is quite a serious misdiagnosis.
What sort of analysis is being carried out?
Do the European citizens know this?
Should we not give some thought to this subject?
(Applause)
Respect the ground rules that have been adopted unanimously.
Respect the Irish 'no' vote.
The Treaty of Nice has failed to be adopted.
Acquire a more comprehensive circle of advisers.
He was virtually buried under the weight of praise.
Their symbolic value is great.
I look forward to your reaction to this suggestion.
The second point concerns your Laeken Declaration.
A final point.
I shall now come back to three points.
We need a stronger diplomatic mechanism.
I wish you every success.
Is the voice of the people being listened to?
No, it is not.
It is a so-called structured debate.
The delay is unacceptable.
But more is required than that.
And you have already mentioned a number of things.
That Tampere Summit is almost two years old.
The Feira Summit is my last example.
This charter has gone unheeded.
What place will you grant to businesses?
Mr President, thank you for the warm reception.
A link must also be established between the two.
I must say that what I heard sounded good.
And then I shall address Mr Michel.
I have a critical comment on this.
Because I gather that that is the intention.
Surely the convention can do that when it meets.
The convention for the Charter worked well.
It is a good start.
I am counting on the Belgian presidency here.
Enlargement must be a success for Europe.
However, this analysis goes even further.
(Applause)
The programme of the Belgian presidency is ambitious.
"We have to resolve the Irish question."
We need to make them feel like European citizens.
Despite this, the wider context is difficult.
Public alarm in the face of enlargement is real.
The one must be linked to the other.
On the contrary.
You should include this project among your priorities.
Euronews is financed by Europe.
Make it a project, Prime Minister!
This has been expressed in various different ways.
Well, I find that a reductionist view.
The problem must be tackled.
My second marginal comment concerns the convention.
It is therefore vital to ratify this Treaty quickly.
That strikes me as better advice.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Verhofstadt.
I wish the presidency and Belgium every success.
The debate is closed.
Situation in FYROM
I just want to underline this point.
There cannot be a solely military solution.
Secondly, the KLA was allegedly disarmed in Kosovo.
Where are the weapons coming from now then?
Nevertheless, I have two concerns.
This is a very tricky business.
Of course, aid is not automatic.
I would be very careful about this.
The world was too small.
Mr LÃ©otard was almost not allowed into Macedonia.
Is the Council involved?
How come we have lost Mr Robertson?
We have heard you quoting Mr Badinter.
What are Mr Badinter' s views?
Do you support that?
There is no symmetry between the two sides.
More is the pity.
There is no symmetry.
It will not be the first time!
Neither have been done.
Quite the opposite!
We need to state this openly here.
I welcome the fact that NATO is on standby.
They can see economic and democratic development.
This is the core of the whole peace process.
They failed to do so.
Europe has done no such thing.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
(The President cut the speaker off)
VOTE

Simplified procedure - Procedure without report

Before the vote
The text is therefore rejected.
(Loud applause)
I believe that this is perfectly clear.
Are there any objections?
Did you vote on this matter?
No, Mr McMillan-Scott, I did not vote.
(Mixed reactions)
I believe that is the point.
(Mixed reactions)
I acted as my conscience dictated.
It is their decision.
This result is absolutely clear.
I congratulate you on this.
I should like to thank you for this.
(Applause)
I fully respect your personal choice.
Before the vote
That is an individual and personal right.
Thank you, Mrs Rothe.
Regarding Amendment No 11
Very well, we shall take note of this.
Madam President, I have a similar problem.
Very well.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Lehne report (A5-0237/2001)
It was a minimum requirement.
Mrs Kauppi is sitting here behind me.
Sadly, Parliament has deviated from this position.
.
.
.
Hence our abstention from voting.
.
Our approach must be coherent.
We should not be encouraging this approach.
That also applies to our investors.
We have therefore voted in favour.
.
Yet the opposite is the case.
What are the problems?
1.
2.
3.
4.
What kind of logic is that?
.
.
Recommendation for second reading Rothe (A5-0227/2001)
Every gardener knows that peat is a biodegradable product.
It also decomposes on the surface of marshland.
I hope the debate will continue.
The Council wants to include it.
.
.
We therefore choose to support the compromise.
Karas report (A5-0220/2001)
And how did we manage it?
.
Ettl report (A5-0211/2001)
Ettl report (A5-0212/2001)
Why is that?
Flesch report (A5-0226/2001)
ICANN has a Policy Advisory Board of 19 members.
Gothenburg European Council
I likewise request that all further ratifications stop.
UE/NGL), in writing.
.
.
Alas, the resolution did not do so.
.
Randzio-Plath report (A5-0225/2001)
But is management by technocrats any better?
To tell the truth, both systems are unworkable.
The second difference concerns transparency.
The third difference concerns voting in the Governing Council.
.
.
.
What else can we say?
.
(NL) My group voted against Paragraph 20.
The reason for this is as follows.
.
Maaten report (A5-0222/2001)
And it is still going on.
Its reaction, however, is disturbing.
.
The House, and all the press downstairs ...
What matters is the declaration by the presidency.
I also accept the declaration, albeit reluctantly.
This is not a trivial matter.
Surely that is not an unreasonable expectation?
Welcome
Human rights in the world and EU fundamental rights
But we must begin by improving our own approach.
Let me explain myself.
So why choose the Charter of Fundamental Rights?
I think we had to do so.
Lastly, it is a reference document.
This report offers us a means of doing so.
Quite the contrary.
At any rate, that is my hope.
This paragraph was also removed.
That means it is still very young.
Basically, most of these objectives have been attained.
Second European ideal: progress.
Third ideal: equality.
Equality is a hugely powerful lever in Europe.
They lie at the very heart of European integration.
They give it its most specific and real meaning.
It allows them to regain their freedom of choice.
Europe cannot watch passively while the intolerable happens.
Europe exists thanks to peace.
In fact this process is already under way.
We must not pass up this unique opportunity.
This value must apply in all democracies.
Events have shown that things are changing rapidly here.
(Applause)
Moreover, the rhetoric is matched with hard support.
Clearly, it has achieved its objective.
Their time will come!
Earthly justice will prevail.
This is a frequently asked question.
However, we must continue our efforts.
Perhaps it needs us to call openly for action.
Human rights are not an opportunistic issue.
I hope that the governments will heed this warning.
The same applies to applicant countries.
We defend some minorities but not others.
Our most powerful weapon is our imagination.
We need it now.
The world has become a harsher place for dictators.
However, these conditions do not prevail.
Journalists are being killed, threatened and persecuted.
We will continue to do this.
But there are signs of progress.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
They are both very good reports.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It limits itself to the most fundamental human rights.
They have no place here.
Human rights are also a matter of living law.
We must guard it like watchdogs.
What could be a more welcome outcome?
I think we have to.
That must stop.
The human rights situation really has declined.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The greater good, the greatest good is democracy.
This is what I wanted to say to him.
Are you not slightly embarrassed, Mr Michel?
(The President cut the speaker off)
We need to apply even more pressure.
There really is something that operates outstandingly in Europe.
Where else in the world has that been achieved?
Nowhere.
What is the European Union doing?
However, there is one problem.
A great deal of cowardice.
Mr Schroeder?
Mr Blair?
Mr Chirac?
Mr Jospin?
No-one said a single word!
What has changed in the meantime?
There is a committee ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is what we want.
Dalits are regularly abused by the higher caste.
Women are raped and no one can attain justice.
There is systematic inequality of opportunity.
Human rights and fundamental liberties are universal and inseparable.
It must set an example.
We are using double standards and that must change.
That concludes my administrative shopping list.
My group will support the report of Mr Cornillet.
It contains a number of important declaration.
Combating this divide deserves our support.
Perhaps indeed a little too exhaustive.
The rights of peoples are also human rights.
This was why I was not in the chamber.
I am particular impressed by its structure.
We have already talked about this.
We all agree on this.
This evidence should be given greater emphasis.
Our action will be on a long-term basis.
I will give you three examples.
Words should be followed by action.
The Coptic Christians feel like second-class citizens.
The Christian minority in Turkey continues to shrink.
There is much to do in this area.
They are persecuted by Muslim Jihad fighters.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
You have been almost excessive in your brevity.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Bonn Conference on Climate Change
Mr President, I apologise for my lateness.
First and most crucially: money.
The strain on the Europeans will be greater.
Are we prepared for this, I ask?
We MEPs who follow these issues recognise that.
All the other countries of Europe increased them.
We are not content to remain as a chorus.
These need to be resolved.
The current situation could not be worse.
That is precisely the issue which arises here.
Making a verbal commitment is easy.
We all know that.
My third comment relates to the text itself.
That compromise must aim to keep Japan on board.
This is very disappointing.
I do not think there is room for complacency.
In what form will we be trading our emissions?
And how will the trade among sectors be regulated?
What is the solution?
Kyoto should not remain an empty pledge.
We have to abandon the emphasis on domestic action.
It just is.
The same facts reveal themselves in every direction.
Bonn needs to be a success.
This has already been pointed out several times.
Thank you very much, Mr Liese.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Question Time (Council)
We shall examine Questions to the Council.
We only have 40 minutes.
It is absolutely rational and necessary.
We have been economical.
Even with Rule 19, I have flexibility.
This is my final interpretation of Rule 19.
Question No 1 by (H-0516/01):
Question No 2 by (H-0518/01):
Question No 3 by (H-0520/01):
Question No 4 by (H-0522/01):
Question No 5 by (H-0524/01):
Question No 6 by (H-0525/01):
Question No 7 by (H-0526/01):
Question No 8 by (H-0560/01):
Question No 9 by (H-0531/01):
Question No 10 by (H-0547/01):
I shall listen to your supplementary questions with interest.
I therefore identify with your plea entirely.
I am able to speak from experience.
So, once again, my best congratulations!
Actually I do know a little about Catalonia.
Even Luxembourg has more!
I would ask you to think about that.
Any reply would be quite premature.
I will do so on another occasion.
Question No 11 by (H-0545/01):
I am afraid I cannot guarantee that.
I would be a fairy if I could.
Question No 12 by (H-0550/01):
Turkey, however, has not benefited from those.
I would like to address the issue of Turkey.
Is the legislation insufficiently clear with regard to Turkey?
Question No 13 by (H-0553/01):
Question No 14 by (H-0555/01):
I have taken note of your remarks.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
Macro-financial assistance to Yugoslavia
We are proposing a number of amendments to you.
Let me also make one general political point.
This also required courage.
That is ultimately extremely painful and disgraceful.
I fully support the Commission on this point.
This is a positive development.
Yet positive developments can sometimes leave a stale after-taste.
It was not a pretty sight.
This debate must continue in Yugoslavia.
Secondly, there must be reconciliation with its neighbours.
For a long time, there were no relations.
That also applies to the assessment of that aid.
I see these contradictions in other areas too.
Macedonia has been mentioned.
But history will have the last word.
The cause is simple.
Thank you very much.
As I said before, our objective is limited.
We are cooperating via two channels.
Secondly, the political conditions.
Of course it is exceptional assistance.
Of course it is of a temporary nature.
And this is already reflected in the text.
You request additional reports to Parliament.
There are two problems.
This is not the real difficulty.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
It is simply not listening!
He too is calling for more transparency.
We want complete budgetary autonomy.
... of the Belliard building.
3 be adopted.
I think this is also worth mentioning.
The public would also like to have some answers.
(Applause)
Our proposals are as follows.
.
I have already drawn your attention to it.
It is no longer a matter of money.
That has now suddenly increased to seven.
I should like to put this to you now.
Within all the groups.
Let me explain why.
I think this is wrong.
This also deserves criticism here.
My second point is this.
Consumer policy - that is a word to savour!
Explain that to the European public!
We are handing back billions!
That is the case here today as well.
We must ensure that the public understands the situation.
We must move away from this situation.
We must be able to manage this.
The increase in revenue is a good thing.
Administrative payments are in a pitiful state.
The Commission must improve its ability to pay considerably.
Why were these amendments not made at the time?
It has been given a reduction on contributions.
This is no mere accident.
I accept that.
I applaud that.
Two of those will be on a roll-call vote.
The basic conditions are quite worrying.
This is something that the Council must not change.
The setbacks are the outbreaks of animal diseases.
Is it possible to have insurance cover in place?
It comes around every year.
We are all highly taxed.
It is almost inevitable.
However, Mr Dover and so were also involved.
You expect Labour members to stand the pace!
(Mixed reactions)
This is acceptable to the Commission.
Regarding the second Supplementary and Amending Budget.
That is the law as it stands.
That is what it says in the Treaty.
That is where it really belongs.
That is not what it is about at all.
Now to Mr Costa Neves' s report.
Mr Costa Neves has described these in detail.
I should like to say the following.
Now a word on administrative expenditure.
, Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
That cannot be true.
The letter has no other meaning.
It was entirely businesslike.
I just wanted to explain that.
Thank you.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Management of Community programmes
These agencies are certainly something new.
Second, there are the executive agencies themselves.
That is not our objective.
I am approaching my conclusion.
That may be right.
It means the Commission must delegate and decentralise.
Mr Bourlanges has just mentioned that.
We also back the report by Mr Bourlanges.
There is still room for improvement.
That is a major improvement in my view.
Firstly, his definition of externalisation is rather skimpy.
A decisive Commission needs flexibility.
What will be the specific task of those bodies?
What are the salient points for the liberal group?
That is our strong view.
My warmest congratulations.
An executive agency is set up by the Commission.
The Commission exercises control through its own departments.
The prerogatives of the budgetary authority are preserved.
Mr President, just a brief word.
I have not had it.
This is an issue of fundamental importance to us.
I have not received it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Safe operation of mining activities
.
Both these accidents had international environmental consequences.
We would like more research in this area.
Thank you for such excellent cooperation.
I would raise two points with the rapporteur.
That does require regulation.
We think it is excellent.
Aristotle himself said the improbable will probably happen.
This dialogue is already taking place.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Coastal zone management in Europe
The EU should be taking advantage of these benefits.
The coastal zone requires special management.
A recommendation is basically non-binding.
That is completely unfair.
As everyone knows, environmental issues cross all boundaries.
There is no such thing as national borders.
Otherwise governments just ignore it.
In relation to coastal zones it is extremely important.
This has to be addressed.
Another issue is climate change.
This has to be taken into account.
We can see the quick destruction of our coasts.
They want to "cop-out" of their responsibilities.
This should not be allowed.
No crabs, no tourists, no money!
Why a legal framework?
This will certainly require a legal framework.
On that point I agree with other Members.
This is what we should be doing.
We see aggressive competition between users of these resources.
We shall be abstaining from the vote.
But such good work can be undermined.
That is why the Commission proposal is so welcome.
We thank Parliament for putting forward these amendments.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12.10 a.m.)
I wanted to say that in this House.
G8 Summit
I shall give Commissioner Patten the floor straight away.
The Commission fully supports this focus for the summit.
First, the fight against communicable diseases.
The European Union has taken a strong lead.
This will be President Bush's first G8 summit.
The G8 is not an organisation or an institution.
I will just make one final point.
I feel that is a tragedy.
Will these decisions be taken at Genoa?
We have a problem with many of our meetings.
How much real success is there in changing things?
Where is Europe?
Europe remains silent.
Europe must now keep the momentum going.
World trade with the intention of fighting poverty.
We need much more than that, however.
That generates mistrust and encourages rejection.
I will focus on this last aspect.
Why?
When will these things happen?
We need these political answers.
We need financial stability on the markets.
The debate is closed.
Recreational craft
It consists of many small enterprises and enthusiasts.
First of all, on the issue of retrospectivity.
We need to retain this.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
I think Mr Schnellhardt has highlighted the main point.
That much is obvious.
I would thank the rapporteur for a good proposal.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Aid to uprooted people in developing countries
Nevertheless, the 1997 regulation expired in 1999.
What did Parliament receive more than a year later?
I recommend we approve this report.
In the main, the programme is a success.
Are we not in a rather curious position?
It is about the Montevideo Convention.
I did this report in the last parliament.
I have three points that I want to make.
I suspect Commissioner Patten will agree with that point.
Nonetheless, this work is absolutely essential.
Without them, success will elude us.
This really is not the way it should be.
What plans are there for achieving this in practice?
We can only censure the Council for this attitude.
There have even been forced incidents of circumcision.
Similar atrocities are taking place in Irian Jaya.
That is, surely, not justifiable.
This has been an interesting if short debate.
I say that without any qualification.
Unfortunately, there was not much to celebrate.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Please could you take suitable action here.
Mr Meyer, we talked about this matter yesterday.
We shall now proceed to the vote.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Haug/Ferber report (A5-0239/2001)
Haug report (A5-0238/2001)
My group cannot subscribe to this approach.
That is why my group rejects this report.
I have voted against the proposal.
We do not wish to support such a development.
Costa Neves report (A5-0241/2001)
This is where the appropriate answers can be found.
Niebler report (A5-0232/2001)
Mr President, it is the year 2005.
Every evening, I watch Fatuzzo's European Show.
McKenna report (A5-0219/2001)
Callanan report (A5-0218/2001)
She was called Marilyn.
Brok report (A5-0244/2001)
For all these reasons we have abstained.
Wuori report (A5-0193/2001)
That is urgent.
Even human rights reports should not ignore refugees.
Cornillet report (A5-0223/2001)
He was arrested.
His personal computer was confiscated.
It is unworthy and intolerable.
It must end as soon as possible.
Otherwise we will abstain.
That is going too far.
That cannot be allowed to happen.
That concludes voting time.
Topical and urgent subjects of major importance
Death penalty in the world
We have therefore made progress.
It is true: there was an inconsistency there.
The same applies to the United States of America.
The problem is not to abolish death.
I think there are sometimes temptations in that direction.
One hundred countries have already abolished the death penalty.
It puts one in mind of the Middle Ages.
This cruelty outrages and horrifies me.
Such cases have occurred in the past.
It is cruel and inhumane.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Beijing's application to host the 2008 Olympic Games
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Tibet has been occupied for over 50 years.
Fair hearings are denied.
Sport cannot be divorced from politics.
There was one common understanding, however.
For that there can be no excuse.
That is why our group supports this resolution.
Perhaps not everyone knows that, especially our guests.
Calling the oppression 'healthy' is hair-raising.
I hope that our opinion will carry some weight.
That is not the case in China.
Quite the contrary, in fact.
Tibet is being systematically stripped of its own character.
The environmental and animal welfare situation is atrocious.
The global media attention will only exacerbate this potential.
That is why there is hope.
More welfare will ultimately lead to more political freedom.
The Chinese are a patient people.
I feel certain of this.
We cannot isolate a nation-state of 1.3 billion people.
I recommend it to the House.
I do not believe that I am being naive.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
South Africa
Belarus
Situation of Burundian refugees in Tanzania
We have therefore had some successes.
We must mobilise against those evils.
A second point on the optional protocol.
So 29 countries have signed up to it.
That includes all fifteen European Member States.
Only four countries have ratified it.
I very much appreciate them.
There is no disagreement between us on that.
We shall not vote against.
This approach will undoubtedly bear fruit if pursued consistently.
Child models are used.
I think our position should therefore be implacable.
We must secure that, at least.
I would like to congratulate them warmly.
Happily now we can discuss them.
But the situation is shameful.
There has been a political push forward.
One fundamental element is the fight against child labour.
There is cause for hope, however.
It is a first step in the right direction.
Religious freedom in Vietnam
(The President cut the speaker off)
Do you really wish to speak now?
You were quite right, Mr Patten.
There is no freedom of religion in Vietnam.
See its participation in the ASEM process.
I therefore emphatically call on them to do so.
This is completely unacceptable.
This is completely unacceptable.
The patriarch was imprisoned for 20 years.
They still exist as political forces today.
South Africa
We all know what this country has been through.
Today, Nelson Mandela is fighting anti-white racism.
All this was discussed at length.
That is not all.
We need to work on this.
The immigrant communities are living in fear and anxiety.
Belarus
Once again, an understandable attitude.
There is a way to influence Belarus via Russia.
The opposition is still being persecuted and criminalised.
Can you imagine?
It is intolerable.
Belarus still represents a challenge for European diplomacy.
It was the anti-Europeans who criticised him.
Situation of refugees from Burundi in Tanzania
A further 150,000 civilians have been killed since then.
These people were poor before.
They are even poorer today.
We must be more active and rethink our strategy.
We must embark on this with great urgency.
The most recent one is currently being implemented.
I now turn to Belarus.
I welcome this timely debate.
How could we not be?
Thank you very much Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Illegal exploitation of natural resources in Democratic Republic of Congo
It must not stop at empty words.
The report is lucid and clear in its recommendations.
We can get them round the table.
We can also exert heavy pressure on this point.
It is a complicated game.
That is clear.
We can make everything dry up there.
The population sees none of the proceeds.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Earthquake in Peru
on the earthquake in Peru;
That says it all.
The Commission reacted very promptly.
It was a pretty vigorous maiden as maidens go!
Thank you very much indeed Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Results of the multiannual guidance programmes for fishing fleets
It shows that this is a very important report.
I find that deeply regrettable.
We support that.
We think it is a good idea.
Everyone recognises this failure in private.
My report comes later.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
I agree with you wholeheartedly there.
I agree with you wholeheartedly here.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Cod stock in the Irish Sea
Thanks also to the Commission.
I certainly welcome that.
This report also helps French fishermen.
I hope it is successful.
That must be welcomed by everyone.
Everyone has to cooperate if we are to succeed.
Do these new methods have an effect?
There is growing realism that there is a problem.
It has come about to achieve this technical agreement.
That is the way forward.
The situation is no longer sustainable.
That is why regional management is the way forward.
We have therefore amended the regulation accordingly.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.

Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 6.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Tribute
Statement by the President
Unfortunately, this cost him his life.
We still do not know who carried this out.
Request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity
We take note of that announcement.
We believe it is a step forward.
You and I are Members of Parliament.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
Therefore, your comment here was unnecessary.
(Applause from the PPE Group)
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
With regard to the membership of committees:
Agenda
It is therefore a matter of urgency.
We all know about Coreper in the Council.
(Parliament rejected the request)
President.
The reports will not be placed on the agenda.
Relating to Tuesday:
I have some information to share with you.
Relating to Wednesday:
The rest of the agenda remains unchanged.
), rapporteur.
I shall give the floor to Mr Baron Crespo.
Why?
That is something for the various groups to do.
The groups will negotiate the content of the resolution.
(Parliament rejected the request)
This is also provided for in the agenda.
We could combine both topics.
So, how shall we deal with this?
Fine.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Speeches relating to procedure
Would you address the president of that parliament?
Parliament has a major role to play.
And ... then I went for a swim!
I shall do so, Mrs Morgantini.
Today, 500 people remain in custody.
Once again, I shall certainly do so.
This should not involve little children going to school.
Let these little children go to school unhindered.
We expect those responsible to be put on trial.
I spoke about 1977.
All those victims also deserve our sympathy and respect.
And there are now around a thousand of them.
European Company Statute
The next item is the joint debate on:
The academic foundations were laid in the late 1950s.
It contained uniform law down to the last detail.
SEs will differ from one Member State to another.
The Davignon Report calls these reference rules.
The EWC Directive talks of subsidiary requirements.
This idea was also decided upon in Nice.
We support the regulations governing participation agreed in Nice.
We must finally take the first step, however.
We must get a foot in the door.
The next gust of wind will open that door.
This does not mean that taxes should be harmonised.
We therefore welcome the European Company.
He is quite right.
In this day and age that is totally intolerable.
I should know.
It is not perfect.
It will come back and we will improve it.
We have already referred to this within the committee.
What complete disorder!
I do not want to go into the details.
So we do not need Parliament.
This is the strategy of the Council.
Why should it be adopted?
So what are the advantages?
Why should we create a European limited liability company?
What are the fiscal advantages, for example?
I, for one, cannot see any.
We can be very clear about this.
We therefore ultimately agree on this approach.
The rapporteur refers to taxation.
Companies are reliant on their employees.
There are a number of models of worker participation.
I broadly welcome this as a pragmatic proposal.
Management alone cannot make important decisions.
We can certainly carry this out earlier.
Why is that?
Very little has been produced.
As has been said, this is voluntary.
Other changes might be needed.
Too often EU laws get set in stone.
We need to become much lighter on our feet.
This should become the rule rather than the exception.
We are agreed upon the objectives.
However, transposition is often half-hearted.
European works council
, rapporteur.
However, every light has its shadow.
Partnership is not a soporific measure.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That also needs to be tightened.
The sanctions for non-compliance are also critical.
The directive has already had an effect.
The Commission' s report shows this.
This is vitally important.
I hope that this debate will help achieve that.
They must also understand the different mentalities.
May tomorrow' s vote be just as successful!
We should in all cases honour the 1994 Directive.
That remains the Commission's strong view.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Monitoring application of Community law (1999)
I have read several previous reports containing interesting suggestions.
The general diagnosis remains the same.
I can accept two of the three proposed amendments.
That is obvious.
What does more Europe mean?
Thirdly, equality.
Mr President, our debate today is somewhat absurd.
This is a fundamental problem.
We do not think so.
It is up to elected representatives.
This is the big question everybody seems to avoid.
We need to be aware of these issues.
There are profound differences between the different legal systems.
Paragraph D contains a statement well worth noting.
That is certainly an interesting acknowledgement.
The main reasons for that are as follows.
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Commission reform
We know you have been consulting extensively.
We do not want to disrupt that process.
Today, EUR 600 million is stated.
In any case, we need a response.
We certainly intend to do that.
All of the reform investment is essential.
We are worried.
You are going to produce a new version.
When will this be?
I could go on and on.
You know that you have our support.
We want you to take risks.
All these points go together.
I slightly disagree with my colleague Mrs Guy-Quint.
We have to keep this as short as possible.
I would love to be offered the same.
In conclusion, we have made significant progress.
I think that remark was rather apposite.
Maybe they are in my office.
My problem is not English.
So what is our main cause for concern?
The proposal has been made in detailed form.
I am optimistic that this cooperation will be forthcoming.
No more no less.
Mr Miller refers to timing.
That is an apposite point.
That is why we are not rushing.
We have kept our promises.
That is not in anybody's interests.
We have developed a strategic planning and programming system.
We have not finished the reform.
I failed and I apologise.
My comment referred purely to the first part.
Thank you, Mr Dell'Alba.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was suspended at 9.52 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
We will correct that, Mr Corbett.
(The Minutes were approved)
It is a report of Parliament.
Thank you, Madam President.
(Applause)
Thank you.
We shall look into this very carefully.
There are no other points of order.
Situation in the Middle East
I would like to thank you for your understanding.
In my view, this is an aberration.
Of course, he does much more than that.
Outside help now appears essential.
This means that they must each review their attitudes.
(Applause)
It really is an intensely difficult problem.
What is the alternative?
That is a grossly unfair criticism.
(Applause)
(Applause from the right)
But what is the United States doing?
It says that things should be done differently.
That is not what I want at all.
I appreciate that this is difficult.
It might even be impossible.
In my opinion, this includes that instrument too.
I support the comments made by Commissioner Patten.
Thank you in advance.
(Applause from the GUE/NGL Group)
The Union has an historical duty to be involved.
Any other suggestion is just hot air.
(Applause from the TDI group)
How can the EU respond?
Firstly, the will of the two sides.
Nobody can grant what is not theirs.
It is that simple.
Did we treat Milosevic and the Kosovans equally?
Did we treat Mandela and the apartheid regime equally?
They seem to have evaporated into thin air.
That is something I regret.
We all know exactly what is going on.
He is making himself plain.
We are asking for international law to be respected.
The Mitchell plan was not rejected by Mr Arafat.
Without a doubt, Europe must act.
Why do we not say so openly?
Why do we not make the situation plain?
Such a situation inevitably brought Mr Sharon to power.
Were sanctions imposed?
Did you demand transparency, Commissioner?
What did Mr Arafat do?
He said no to peace at Camp David.
One month later, the Intifada was resumed.
Did they even subject their funding to any conditions?
The problem is how to put them into effect.
The Europeans should cease worrying about having a role.
They have one.
It was an institution looking for a role.
The precedents are not good.
What else can we do?
The United States has endorsed the Israeli position.
That should continue to be our primary objective.
So Mr Sharon has not seen Mr Solana.
Can the Council give us more information?
Has the Council been informed of this?
I should like to know.
Thank you, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
I shall now give the floor to Commissioner Patten.
I want to be very clear on this.
I wish they did convey such a message.
The honourable Member talks about economic measures.
That is what we should be doing.
(Applause)
The meeting will, therefore, take place tomorrow.
The debate is closed.
Progress of the 12 candidate countries in 2000
The next item is the joint debate on:
We must not erect further new barriers.
We ought to strengthen this stability accordingly.
(Applause)
Why enlargement?
Enlargement is the future of Europe.
Enlarging the Union is an historical duty.
The Member States therefore reap many benefits.
So, what stage have the negotiations reached?
I am, of course, referring to Turkey.
Misunderstandings must be cleared up.
Enlargement offers enormous scope.
The credibility of accession requires efforts on all sides.
That has been the case with each new accession.
The point of no return is definitely behind us.
The project is now irreversible.
But living in Europe means living with compromises.
We need to make that link.
That came at the right moment.
The Commission will be sticking to this line resolutely.
There must be no new dividing lines created.
A secure frontier is one of the essential prerequisites.
That will take decades to achieve.
(Applause)
The overall economic situation is another matter.
We need to be very, very realistic here.
They will continue to grow.
That requires special preparation and a separate decision.
That is a perfectly logical sequence.
Kaliningrad is an entirely different matter.
We would like to see a faster tempo here.
Now one question remains.
We need to make greater efforts here.
I agree with what Mr Brok said about it.
Many people are frightened by enlargement.
(Applause)
Then we agreed on this Tuesday.
So that is no personal criticism of yourself.
(Applause)
That is a tremendous historical development.
(Applause)The accession countries also have dignity.
We will also increase acceptance in our border regions.
(Applause)
We are prepared for that.
There are many points there.
That is correct.
Funding up until 2006 is secured.
Most surely not.
It has its price.
But non-enlargement is expensive, too.
It costs much more than enlargement.
Failure to enlarge will deprive Europe of its future.
We need political leadership and political vision.
I would appeal to other states to do so.
But inside this there is another real issue.
We are now getting real.
I would like to highlight five questions:
The second difference concerns Mr Brok' s report.
We must be quite clear about this.
Welcome
You are most welcome to the House.
The Commission still refuses to produce such a document.
This is a remarkable statement.
Temelin has significant safety defects.
The place to resolve this problem is Brussels.
I await a European initiative to close it down.
We will resume this debate at 3 o'clock.
We ought to investigate this.
VOTE
Nationality and citizenship are not the same thing.
European citizenship is what we support.
According to my text, it is quite clear.
That is the text that we are voting on.
(Parliament adopted the resolution) President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Hans-Peter Mayer report (A5-0243/2001)
Hopefully this will now do that.
The new proposal therefore seems both complex and inadequate.
No one has managed to assess it properly either.
Yet, this agreement does not currently exist.
.
.
I know the problem.
They always have something else to do.
Menrad report (A5-0231/2001)
We refuse to approve this farce.
These proposals have failed on the issue of participation.
Some claim to be concerned about workers' rights.
Menrad report (A5-0282/2001)
.
UK Conservatives believe in the principle of works councils.
Over-prescriptive legislation can turn them into a barrier.
Flexibility, not rigidity, is required.
We are no further forward on this.
.
.
Blokland report (A5-0267/2001)
.
Koukiadis report (A5-0250/2001)
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Perhaps you could note this in a suitable letter.
The enlargement process must be seen in this perspective.
This must not be some wait-and-see project.
It is not a straightforward issue.
However, that is not enough.
That applies just as much in our own countries.
It prevents people from getting to know each other.
I am the third rapporteur for the Baltic states.
Commissioner Verheugen talked about that as well this morning.
Allow me to comment on the latest developments.
The European Union is not rigid.
We should not confuse two different things here.
Credit where credit is due.
Take the unacceptably high level of unemployment.
The country is taking advantage of this.
Nevertheless, there are points of criticism.
However, the inquiry is still under way.
That is why the coalition has come under pressure.
In fact, they themselves subscribe to this wish.
Unpleasant incidents are still occurring.
Some of these measures are already in place.
Many regard this as ambitious, but not unrealistic.
The accession process is continuing.
That is tremendous progress.
They are currently being ratified by the two parliaments.
It proves to be an account with many contrasts.
The cold war is over.
All the walls in Europe have been knocked down.
The enemies of yesteryear have become our partners.
Malta is continuing to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria.
Its institutions are democratic and function smoothly.
There are no particular problems as regards human rights.
Malta is not a country in transition.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Negotiation should be left to the specialists.
Opinion polls show this.
It is also a gift from them to ourselves.
The European Union should be more than a market.
I wonder whether we are communicating or simply hiding?
In particular I want to focus on Hungary.
This is borne out by recent opinion polls.
In the candidate countries, enlargement is widely supported.
That seems to me to be self-evident.
Freedom and independence incite nations into action.
I think we need to look into all this.
Secondly, the economic data show positive developments.
The macroeconomic situation has improved.
We have reached an important stage.
We look towards the goal with optimism.
I should like to make one crucial point.
I take one particular example.
Clearly that whole saga is very unsatisfactory.
I welcome Mrs Souladakis' report.
Very vulnerable women, at that.
We do not want to be accomplices.
.
The same applies to me.
But there is more.
That is not the fault of public opinion.
I repeat what I said this morning.
That is absolutely certain.
I fully agree with this.
Solutions need to be found here.
To my mind these are crucial to European values.
We should refrain from unfounded accusations.
Firstly, in the political field.
We can only fully agree with him.
Some other nations are worried about their cultural identity.
They also seemed to me to be very critical.
Mr President, Commissioner.
First, the timing of the debate.
Why should this be the case?
I think this is too soon.
We must respect the pace of each applicant country.
This is the problem.
Mr President, two topics in one minute.
I am not saying that we must accept everything.
I think this is paramount.
This triggers anti-European sentiments because the debate is over-simplified.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
White paper on the reform of European governance
The Europeans expect much of Europe.
I, for one, do not believe this.
It is an over-simplistic solution.
Let me explain all this in greater detail.
That would not be appropriate.
The underlying problem is a lack of communication.
Community legislation is often criticised as being too heavy-handed.
That is for you to decide.
The refocusing must be an inter-institutional process.
Thank you, Mr Prodi.
The White Paper is a departure point.
Correct.
That is one important aspect.
That brings me to my second point.
Quite right.
But we need to strengthen it.
But we are prepared to discuss this with you.
Thirdly, delegating decisions.
You say nothing about it in your White Paper.
Are you for or against it?
(Applause)
We are therefore searching for the meaning.
We also support greater involvement of mainstream society.
That is positive.
We attach special importance to institutional equilibrium.
Neither have you, I hope.
But I have other concerns.
As does the overwhelming majority of the House.
Do you know what the immediate problem was?
It is all pure Eurospeak, was the reply.
This reading of the problem is simply not true.
So, Mr President, be bold!
Which issues cross borders?
Which can we not manage for ourselves?
However your solutions are extremely weak.
All the rest is just idle chit-chat.
They are all written in specialised language.
Therefore, we must endeavour to adapt.
Finally, relations with Parliament.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
Question No 37 by (H-0602/01):
This will take a long-term look at both questions.
Question No 38 by (H-0639/01):
Thank you, Mrs Zorba, for this encouragement.
Question No 39 by (H-0641/01):
The situation is extremely complex.
The first question is rather of a meteorological nature.
Naturally one is interested.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
Second part Questions to Mr Busquin
Question No 40 by (H-0606/01):
Questions to Commissioner Nielson
I thank the Commissioner for his response.
That is the reality on the ground.
So, what is happening at the moment?
This work is in progress.
We need indirect arrangements here too.
Question No 41 by (H-0604/01):
Gender inequality is a significant determinant of poverty.
The importance of education cannot be underlined enough.
Would the Commissioner agree with this particular statement?
We will be continuing a high-intensity effort on education.
A broad-based effort is necessary.
Question No 42 by (H-0613/01):
Question No 43 by (H-0616/01):
We will continue with this.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Nor has my own country been spared.
The principles are totally unchanged.
It is a question of improving handling efficiency.
I do not think we have a problem.
We definitely agree on the subject.
Question No 44 by (H-0614/01):
I have two real - not rhetorical - questions.
Who is stopping you?
Is there anything you can do about this?
Question No 45 by (H-0636/01):
Thank you, Commissioner.
I should just like to ask two more questions.
The operations funded focused mostly on basic healthcare.
We are following very closely every activity there.
Question No 46 by (H-0666/01):
It is necessary to approach this with caution.
I believe this is the best way of proceeding.
I will be brief.
We have to address that issue.
That is the core of the problem.
Many allegations have been made.
The Sudanese Government denies them.
We want to get at the truth.
That should be the ambition of us all.
That is as much as we can say now.
I cannot be more precise at the moment.
It neither adds to nor subtracts from the problem.
Questions to Mr Liikanen
Question No 48 by (H-0600/01):
It should then be repeated half a year later.
Thank you for your decision, Mr Newton Dunn.
Question No 51 by (H-0617/01):
Many thanks to the Commissioner for his answer.
Is that a correct interpretation of your answer?
The same security should be guaranteed throughout Europe.
Question No 52 by (H-0620/01):
These aim at improving pedestrian safety in accident situations.
Both alternatives have their good points.
Question No 53 by (H-0629/01):
That should happen in the next few months.
There is therefore no specific basic technology.
Still, I am very troubled, Commissioner.
I thank the Commissioner for his answer.
I will check the situation today.
Question No 54 by (H-0645/01):
This process is now well under way.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Outcome of the Bonn conference on climate change
This made the success in Bonn so important.
Nothing in the agreement prevents it from doing so.
The third message from Bonn concerns globalisation.
There is no going back now.
A real change has to take place.
That also applies to sinks.
I hope so - it certainly did mine.
I would like to congratulate and thank you.
But overall the agreement is weak.
You have still a lot to do.
I thank you again.
Most babies learn to walk around their first birthday.
The same will apply to our Kyoto baby.
He who walks out of negotiations, loses.
There are very good reasons for doing so.
These issues are of concern to us.
But it is an important first step.
Now we have to tackle the question of implementation.
I think we should concentrate on fundamentals.
Mr President, I too say bravo, Commissioner.
Well done.
But nor will the price of nuclear energy rise.
This completely changes the weightings within the energy spectrum.
I just wanted to point that out.
Kyoto has ultimately not remained an empty promise.
The signal must now be seen and heard everywhere.
Sustainable energy can give a boost to development.
Sustainable development must lead to sustainable growth.
This requires research and innovation.
It is now time for action.
Now we can work within that.
We can change and develop it.
I would like your cooperation.
Everything will stand or fall with their implementation.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Safety and air transport
A third point also needs highlighting.
The first concerns the composition of the administrative board.
They principally suffer from a lack of information.
We need to see how its investigations work.
We need to see how its personnel are selected.
Our citizens are increasingly worried about these things.
Is the Authority contributing to safety in aviation?
Finally, accountability.
We can identify well with the final version.
I should like to mention two more things.
We need far greater clarity.
Information should be available when you book your ticket.
It needs to be there in doctors' surgeries.
There was another example in the press this morning.
His claims have been refuted by the airlines.
How awkward and inconvenient democracy is.
Both have presented us with a magnum opus.
In this respect we support your proposal.
I look forward to the Commission's response.
To be delayed is a nuisance.
We can never take aviation safety for granted.
Safety should never be used as a political football.
I condemn Mr Titford for so doing.
Similarly, the Commission proposals also differ.
Is there any justification for these differences?
The research is ambiguous.
There is no need to be an alarmist.
I wish to warmly congratulate both rapporteurs.
Firstly, the monitoring of the voluntary commitments.
This is crucial.
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
System of ecopoints for heavy goods vehicles transiting through Austria
Now the Commission does not like this agreement.
It is not about introducing additional restrictions.
That is a contradiction in itself.
Which is why the whole thing makes no sense.
Protocol no.
That brings me to my second point, sanctions.
Something needs to be done here.
And my third and final point.
I see two points at issue here.
This time is no exception.
Austrians trusted in Europe's word.
Then you would be doing something for environmental protection.
We do not need vox pops!
Vote in favour of the Commission proposal.
Just two more brief comments.
That is not the solution.
That is what we should be fighting for.
I shall confine myself quickly to two puzzling facts.
Austria versus the rest of the world?
That cannot and should not be.
Why do I say this?
Article 11 of Protocol No 9 discusses NOx pollution..
Please read it.
The system of ecopoints itself could be one solution.
Perhaps.
You are wrong, Mr Swoboda.
Mr President, if you lose, you lose.
In that respect you are legally off base.
Exactly what are they then?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Cultural cooperation in the EU
I should like to make a few points.
That is what officials are employed to do.
This was a very interesting and relevant document.
That is best left to the Member States.
So my warmest thanks.
Our citizens today simply want more beautiful things.
One final comment.
So, Parliament is taking the initiative.
What values should they defend?
Point 4: culture and the information society.
Points 5, 8 and 10: strengthening cooperation.
We are therefore in agreement on the basis.
The objective of these meetings is to strengthen cooperation.
I will return to this subject.
Point 9: Structural Funds.
The European Community contributes up to EUR 237 million.
Point 11: The Observatory.
I am delighted with this initiative.
Point 12: the contact points.
It should also be concluded this year.
Points 13 and 14: the Cultural Forum.
Points 15 and 16: patronage.
Together, we shall get down to the job.
National and European budgets are ever "tighter" .
As you can see, nothing has changed.
The credo remains.
In my opinion, they are fundamental.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12.10 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Echelon
Its name, however, is irrelevant.
This they did not do, which speaks volumes.
How do we assess these findings?
Thirdly, the end does not justify the means.
It is not a problem of quantity either.
I can see the logic of that.
But we are not criticising them for that.
Why ever not?
This mistrust has to be weeded out.
There is no world government to protect them.
That is the perennial problem.
(Applause)
The five suspects are also silent.
In short, it is a rather difficult case.
A change in mentality is required.
They exist and they will continue to exist.
But this is not the vital and fundamental issue.
This is the real threat to us all.
Political spying is a greater threat than economic spying.
Whole political and social scenes will be criminalised.
It does exist and represents a considerable step forwards.
This is the first question, which remains unanswered.
This is something we deplore.
The conclusion of the report is quite simply disquieting.
Democratic scrutiny is essential.
The report cannot address all political considerations.
We must be more effective.
The report contains various important recommendations.
Lastly, 44 recommendations have been tabled.
This situation is now very different.
For whatever is technologically possible will be implemented.
This law legitimises ECHELON-type activities.
It is required reading for every democrat.
Did you hear that, Commissioner?
That is nothing exceptional.
Numerous allegations were made before the report was published.
Is there such a thing as an ECHELON system?
If so, what does it do?
And is there a need for democratic initiatives?
We can conclude that the system exists.
'Who watches the watchmen?'
The question is: what does Echelon entail?
What countermeasure does the report propose?
I know of no country in which it works.
So in my view it is no solution.
You have all carried out important work.
I particularly welcome the clear opposition to bribes.
Allow me to highlight two aspects of the report.
My second remark concerns encryption.
Encryption offers the only effective protection against interception.
The resolution poses a fundamental problem.
What is actually happening over there?
We have important work to do in this area.
That is worrying.
These are questions which the report does not answer.
The issue touches on complex technological and political considerations.
These build up a body of evidence.
Privacy is a fundamental right.
This lays down no provisions on intelligence activities.
This concerns both our citizens and our businesses.
The development in technologies can bring protection against surveillance.
Encryption has been mentioned here often.
We need to empower them.
I will highlight some of them.
Thank you very much for that.
I thank the members of the committee.
Some of them are mentioned in the report.
My gratitude to them is no less heartfelt.
(Applause)
Combating terrorism
The report commands a wide consensus of opinion.
Such measures should not be necessary.
Herein lies a potential danger to democracy.
Some may regard such measures as extreme.
The problem is for Europe.
Trafficking in drugs is one example.
Criminalisation will not get us anywhere.
They know very well that such action is illegal.
Whether it is a crime is another matter.
Commissioner Vitorino has the political support of this House.
We genuinely await his proposals with great interest.
It is the opposite of freedom and of life.
The report, very regrettably, ignores state terrorism.
It has been a diluted discussion.
It can therefore only be effectively combated internationally.
Fighting terrorism also means defending human rights and democracy.
Mr President, terrorism is the destruction of democracy.
The tormented victims of brutal terrorism are largely forgotten.
Action on that is imperative.
It is a very balanced and very good report.
We must end safe havens.
There must be maximum cooperation to achieve this.
We also see terrorist cooperation throughout the world.
They use certain words and pseudonyms.
They threaten the communities in which they live.
We have to recognise the victims.
There must be mutual recognition.
And other Members could also speak of their suffering.
Spain and other places in Europe suffer terrorism.
This too is a form of terrorism.
I am only going to make two points.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.

Watson Report (A5-0273/2001)
I commend Mr Watson on his report.
.
the three-year cultural cooperation plan
setting up a European observatory for cultural cooperation
converging VAT.
.
.
, in writing.
.
Ruffolo Report (A5-0281/2001)
We therefore voted against this report.
This is a prerequisite for building a European constitution.
The Commission is also requested:
to create a European agency to monitor cultural cooperation;
.
Schmitt Report (A5-0279/2001)
We agree that this is a necessity.
It can create uniform authorisation procedures,
These would subject the Agency to the following controls:
General Community budgetary procedures would apply to the Agency,
Community anti-fraud legislation would apply to the Agency, and
the Agency would be subject to regular external assessments.
.
.
Swoboda Report (A5-0266/2001)
We are in favour of tighter ecological restrictions.
.
Enlargement can go ahead without the Nice Treaty.
All of this is false.
Ireland is no longer neutral.
.
.
.
.
An Anschluss, in fact.
The 1945 brackets are being closed.
The Empire is rebuilding itself.
.
.
The safety of our coastal regions depends on it.

Van Orden report (A5-0258/2001)
Bulgaria has also applied to join the European Union.
Nicholson of Winterbourne report (A5-0259/2001)
There are no safety implications involved.
That strategy has already been put in place.
It has been paid for through the PHARE programme.
For that reason I voted against the Nicholson report.
.
.
Volcic report (A5-0260/2001)
Why is that?

Poos report (A5-0261/2001)

Stenzel report (A5-0262/2001)
Collins report (A5-0249/2001)

.
This is not envisaged in the report, however.

I fully support this.
Schmid report (A5-264/2001)
Today, I have no regrets!
The rapporteur proposes measures.
Several groups find them inadequate.
1.
2.
3.
.
.
They can no longer communicate in confidence.
There is no real answer.
Thus, I cannot support the report.
And we will certainly have to pose them again.
And if so, what sanctions are being envisaged?
The rapporteur answered yes to the first question.
But what consequences did he draw from this?
.
I do not agree with this.
.
There are certain questions we must ask.
.
Conclusions of the G8 meeting in Genoa
Nice and Gothenburg spring to mind.
Parliaments should be involved in this dialogue.
I would not have missed it for the world.
How can we derive the most benefit from it?
How can we minimise the damage it does?
(Applause)
The summit took a number of important decisions.
Demonstrators must have the opportunity to express their opinions.
Commissioner Vitorino has referred to them.
Lastly, a comment on issues of public order.
There is no more talk of that.
I think that distinction needs to be made.
In my view, that is essential.
I will not go into that today.
Is a European way possible?
This accusation is completely unfounded and unjustified.
I find this unacceptable.
I will end with two brief points for consideration.
We regret that this has not been the case.
That is proof, Mr Ferri!
I have read the newspapers and watched television.
Right-wing authoritarian processes have a history in Europe!
A divided Europe can have no part in this.
This is the real problem facing us.
What is our response?
What is this Parliament' s response?
I was in Genoa for a week.
I visited the prisons.
Yet you want to sweep everything under the table!
Ladies and gentlemen, please vote for an enquiry.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Violence is rejected without equivocation.
We are going to do all of this.
But that is part and parcel of it.
This is not acceptable, this must be prevented.
I wish to make that very clear to you.
My second point relates to the issue in question.
Of course they do not go far enough.
We also have the Schengen Agreements.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Data protection in electronic communications
No one wants a big brother society.
They can be seen as technical in nature.
This is mainly a translation issue, then.
I now turn to the Cappato report.
I would get very annoyed about this too.
The rest offers quite a good level of protection.
Why?
Banning the typewriter was intended to prevent this.
Perhaps this would be appropriate once again today?!
We want child pornography on news groups blocked.
, chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
It is like old times.
I bet you are really glad to be here.
It is a dialogue with the deaf.
We try to discuss issues like school milk.
We made our point.
Nothing happened.
We spoke about the problems with the Structural Funds.
Nothing happened.
You take 1.9 million off it.
It just does not make sense.
It is in reserve.
You did not even respond to that.
We are extremely prudent.
The margin is, of course, decreasing.
Mr President, some things are quickly learnt.
Do these summits ever stop and consider these issues?
For we are left dealing with the implications.
That is a priority for us both.
That concludes this item.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0594/01):
Europol may well be using pirated information technology.
A parallel judicial inquiry has opened in Germany.
.
Question No 2 by (H-0595/01):
I take that into account.
Question No 3 by (H-0599/01):
Question No 4 by (H-0676/01):
(Article 2(d)).
Question No 5 by (H-0678/01):
Question No 6 by (H-0687/01):
Did the Fifteen cooperate in this regard?
That is something I know.
You can ask the question again if you wish.
We are doing all we can to achieve this.
We shall be turning out en masse.
I can only repeat what I have already said.
Question No 7 by (H-0601/01):
The text of the draft decision, doc.
Question No 9 by (H-0605/01):
.
I am sorry.
The seminar is a further initiative.
Question No 10 by (H-0607/01):
We have to be pragmatic about this.
Those regions must be taken into consideration.
Question No 12 by (H-0611/01)
Question No 13 by (H-0619/01):
The presidency has noted that, thank you.
It cannot be prevented.
Question No 14 by (H-0621/01):
Will compensation be provided for the damage caused?
Has there been coordination with the European Union?
Which countries had this been exported to?
Question No 15 by (H-0623/01):
This is not a question, Mr Marinos.
Naturally she shall have the floor.
Consumers in every country will face the same problem.
I did not notice that question in your statement.
A campaign is therefore to be launched.
That is the situation in my country.
Your statement has cheered us all up this evening.
Question No 16 by (H-0624/01):
The European Union is a union of common values.
There has been no question but rather a statement.
Question No 17 by (H-0626/01):
Question No 18 by (H-0628/01):
Question No 19 by (H-0630/01):
.
You may have beaten the record.
Then we would have real democracy in the Council.
Will you do that next?
Progress has been made.
I have tried to convince you of this.
She always has the opportunity.
Question No 20 by (H-0635/01):
You are absolutely right, Mr Marinos.
It is a supplementary question.
Thank you very much.
Question No 21 by (H-0637/01):
I can only repeat what I have just said.
Thank you very much, Madam President-in-Office.
That reply ends this debate.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
Statement by the President
Data protection in electronic communications (continuation)
There is one highly controversial issue, however.
What is our position on direct advertising by e-mail?
Why do we have this situation?
Unwanted post will not be limited to the Internet.
My second remark concerns the storage of traffic data.
I refer to the ECHELON debate of this morning.
I regularly receive unwanted advertising on my e-mail.
Still, I am regularly unsuccessful.
I will not go into detail.
Then you must actually pay for them.
One is asked in advance if one wants something.
My last comment concerns the possibilities of tracing.
Results in violation of the procedures should be cancelled.
We support Amendment No 61 concerning the supervision clause.
Rather, it is enlightened citizens who decide.
We are constantly seeing different forms of spamming.
We have received different information about this.
But we do need to address the security issues.
Those are the critical issues we have to tackle.
Then we should start thinking about principles.
I think that action is needed here.
I will start with the Cappato report.
I want to be crystal clear.
This is starting now with SMS messages.
We are roaming practically all the time.
Mrs Thors raised two questions.
Firstly the situation in the United States.
Mr Coelho asked whether it is difficult to control.
There is no harmonised system.
It is something anybody can try.
I have done it myself.
I am not optimistic.
The opt-in regime is one uniform legal solution.
We discussed these issues earlier today in this House.
I mentioned two of these earlier.
The report identifies key issues for further consideration.
In March, the Commission organised a public hearing.
But I have to ask him another question.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Implementation of competition rules
Parliament agreed with these objectives.
We want it scrapped.
Let me give you an example.
"A bit pregnant" cannot exist here.
Thank you very much.
Of course, I did not feel this reticence.
I welcome decentralisation.
It cannot guarantee legal certainty.
Article 3 is clearly vital.
But this principle is not acceptable without some clarification.
Article 10 is another important article.
Some clarification is essential here too.
Jonathan Evans highlights the example of major investments.
Two final remarks.
That is the heart of the problem.
It is anything but decentralisation.
The least efficient is the democracy.
This is not so much integration as assimilation.
It will all end in tears.
That is something for which I would thank you.
Our powers are closely linked to documentary evidence.
The rules and their scope must be sufficiently predictable.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments
We actually think that possibility is rather remote.
This system applies to Member States.
Absolutely not.
I believe that there is no difficulty here.
Experience suggests that non-payment difficulties do not generally arise.
And that system must be maintained.
In my opinion, no.
This is subject to a technical debate.
It has not been resolved.
Should the European Parliament participate in this model?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations
What exactly is at issue here?
There is a unanimity of opinions on this.
That is exactly the case with octaBDE.
So this is a sort of reversibility clause.
I mentioned that just now.
However, they also have important negative properties.
They are toxic.
I hope the Commission notes that.
The general conclusions are clear.
Accordingly, I would welcome the report.
I commend the report to the House.
The whole group must therefore be banned.
It will probably be a very technical debate.
Pentabromodiphenyl ether.
What' s in a name?
The evaluations have not yet been concluded.
I believe it is a proportionate measure.
It would introduce harmonised rules in the Member States.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Quality and safety standards for human blood and blood components
However, on one point I disagree with him.
What are those principles?
This cannot be overlooked.
Many countries have already established pools of donors.
It is just a question of getting them going.
I think there are two reasons for specifying this.
The first reason is ethical.
That is one reason.
This directive is essential.
The human body is not a commodity.
This also helps to minimise the risk of infection.
That is Amendment No 43.
I hope Members will support it tomorrow.
Giving blood is a positive act of citizenship.
Firstly there is a safety risk.
There is also an ethical risk.
There is one already.
Do the amendments actually violate EU law?
Our proposal for a directive builds on these achievements.
We can accept in full 29 amendments.
First, ethical questions.
Many of you referred to studies.
All of the modern studies run to the contrary.
The third point relates to the technical standards.
Finally, the qualifications of blood establishment staff.
This is too restrictive and cannot be accepted.
52 amendments are acceptable in full or in part.
Many of the amendments will improve the proposal.
Mr President, I shall make this very brief.
You have the floor, Commissioner.
Thank you very much, Mr NisticÃ².
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12.13 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
This is recorded under item 11 of the Minutes.
I cannot give you an answer off the cuff.
(The Minutes were approved)
European Ombudsman/Code of administrative conduct
To me, he represents the model public servant.
By August 2001 the comparable figure was 25 cases.
But it does not.
(Applause)
rapporteur.
Eighty-three per cent of complaints were against the Commission.
In these thanks I wish to include your colleagues.
The European Union is a great ideal.
One, it must be based in law.
Spain, is just one example.
They are alien to our tradition.
Society advances and the law always follows its progress.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
This is very important.
Applause
That is again how one experiences these various speeches.
The Ombudsman is patient, however.
I wish Mr SÃ¶derman every success.
I do not think it is appropriate.
The first is the White Paper.
The Ombudsman himself touched upon this.
You have levelled some serious criticisms at the Commission.
Criticism should be voiced when it is called for.
We shall work towards improvements across the board.
As I said, we totally support it.
We must carry the administrative reform through.
We are quite determined to do so.
Hence the significance of the White Paper.
That amounts to far more than administrative reform.
This does nothing for consistency or legal clarity.
I am grateful to Mr SÃ¶derman for highlighting this.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has tabled three amendments.
That has to be borne in mind.
Of course the Commissioners have administrative functions.
Secondly on the question of all documents.
I would hope for some more concrete proposals.
We try to rectify the situation.
Thank you, Mr SÃ¶derman.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Petitions
[2001/2010(INI)].
The figures speak for themselves.
They are usually indicative of serious shortcomings.
Their support is invaluable and much appreciated.
It remains conspicuous by its absence.
User-friendly guidebooks are needed.
This is an outstanding task.
Some reaction to this negative situation is called for.
The Committee on Petitions can go further, however.
It can involve citizens in drawing up Community rules.
There have been many successes.
We shall therefore vote in favour of it.
That is our first problem.
The petitioners lose patience.
That therefore is another problem.
Responses need to be swifter and more efficient.
That is sometimes the case.
It is not entirely the Commission' s fault.
The Member States take a long time to respond.
Why would they?
We have to deal with different administrations.
There are no other means at our disposal.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Sugar and preparations intended for human consumption
1. certain sugars intended for human consumption
2. honey
This is why we are being consulted again today.
That seems elementary.
The second case, that of honey.
The third case, that of fruit juices.
A positive list should be given.
This is creating problems for us.
Parliament is being slated for this from outside.
We should therefore avoid complicating matters.
This would be an added protection for consumers.
They will only serve to delay the procedure.
Why, then, not fruit for juice production?
There is no such thing.
It helps to keep the consumer better informed.
I should like to reiterate what I said earlier.
They also involve a great deal of uncertainty.
Instead, they cause further confusion.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
No such decision has been taken.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Parliament approved this by a clear majority.
VOTE
The Commission reserves the right to re-examine this matter.
You can now do one of two things.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
I do not understand why.
Mr NisticÃ², you said two things.
We will deal with the compromise amendment later.
That is the reasonable order.
Is that right, Mr NisticÃ²?
Absolutely right.
Mr Tannock is presenting that amendment.
It has the support of myself and Mrs Korhola.
I understand Mr Lund will support it as well.
Following the vote on Amendments Nos 55 and 56.
President.
I would ask if the amendment can be accepted.
I see more than twelve Members.

TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Zimbabwe
These bandits shrink from no form of violence.
Various independent senior judges have resigned as a result.
He recently declared that whites are not human beings.
No comment.
No Member State should be allowed to shirk this.
What are our options according to my group?
Food aid will be a different matter.
It must be distributed by independent organisations.
That makes it extremely important.
We had such great hopes for President Mugabe.
I urge all colleagues to support this resolution.
Mugabe must accept such a solution.
They are hungry and unemployed.
No one can claim they knew nothing about it.
It is plainly about politics.
It is not about colonial powers.
It is about politics.
The communities come together.
He is not listening to placations.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Foot-and-mouth disease
There the suffering of farmers and animals continues unabated.
The figures make our heads spin.
Let me be clear about this.
This is not a loss of production units.
This is the destruction of living creatures.
Perhaps by swimming?
Freedom of movement is freedom of contamination.
The Cairns group would be happy.
Doha would be a success.
Another question.
Controls on our outer borders were inadequate.
A further question.
There were no disinfection points.
We are importing food from these countries.
We must look at that.
The reason is simple.
A word on vaccination.
Is that a successful policy?
We should study how their containment worked and why.
But BSE was a new disease.
That was a genuine European inquiry.
The epidemiology of this outbreak is not in doubt.
The same applies to foot-and-mouth.
The Commission needs to change its strategy.
We need a regulation on feeding or destroying leftovers.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
We are talking fatal consequences here.
We need marker vaccines.
This is not the time to relax our controls.
So what is the Commission' s opinion?
That is just one aspect of this issue.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
Togolese Republic
Kingdom of Cambodia
Republic of Mauritania
What, then, is that constitution worth?
There is no freedom of association for political parties.
Mauritania is preparing thoroughly for the elections in October.
Political opponents of the regime are being neutralised.
We must prepare for pseudo-elections in a pseudo-democracy.
Mrs Sudre and Mrs Langenhagen came with me.
He is quite strong, he is quite popular.
He has done well.
He can do well without locking up his opposition.
I saw their lifestyle.
I believe that the Union must act decisively.
Togo
Democracy is still a fleeting ideal.
Mass demonstrations are mercilessly broken up.
The murdering of opponents of the regime goes unpunished.
Crude misuse of power hampers development and perpetuates poverty.
One of them is General Eyadema from Togo.
On the contrary, the repression is simply continuing.
The latest victim is opposition leader, Mr Agboyibo.
This must be stopped in some way.
Cambodia
I am far from being so enthusiastic.
There is increasing violence.
Afghan refugees seeking asylum in Australia
This is the solution to the problem.
Too little attention is paid to the cause.
Australia's problem is also our problem.
There is widespread concern.
The prosecutor is demanding the death penalty.
Attack on a train in Angola
Who is it who participates in this diamond trafficking?
Angolans must vote for and achieve peace.
No one has yet claimed responsibility for this attack.
In recent years we have observed some progress.
You are right, we cannot remain insensitive.
Work has started within the Council.
I regard such methods as inadmissible.
Mr Wurtz, you were not present.
This is not true.
That is why what was said...
(The President cut the speaker off)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Anti-personnel mines
.
B5-0599/2001 by Mrs Bonino et al
In 1997, a treaty was concluded banning landmines.
One hundred and forty-nine countries have already signed it.
Mr President, I shall keep to the topic.
Landmines kill, every day and in many countries.
We can understand that.
Mr President, what are we doing?
There is no doubt about that.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Drought in Central America
on the drought in Central America.
We are also concerned about the distribution of aid.
Some complaints have been made about this.
I am sure this will be corrected.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Mountain farming
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
This is a report which I can wholeheartedly support.
The importance of mountain ecosystems is a cultural heritage.
Many mountains straddle frontiers.
Mr President, Mr Ebner, well done!
A good report.
Your report also has a drawback, however.
It only focuses on this aspect.
Britain is much the poorer for that.
The first time was in 1983.
Some mountain farmers are over 60.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed
Basic education in developing countries
We are quite tired of hearing about development targets.
They are set and they are endless.
Their learning situation is terrible.
It is only 1% of the total.
Let me just touch on one or two issues.
The impact of HIV is enormous.
Meeting the targets looks difficult.
It is a price worth paying.
Good, free education is essential for development.
Nine hundred million people are still illiterate.
Indicative programmes must be drawn up for each country.
The report of Mrs Kinnock is excellent.
That education must be free.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.

Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 6.55 p.m.)
Acts of terrorism in the United States
We must go further.
Today, we feel that we are all Americans.
(Loud applause)
However, there is also a purely European dimension.
(Loud applause)
The scale of this tragedy demands an appropriate response.
We must avoid any type of impromptu action.
(Loud applause)
(Loud applause)
We do not know who the perpetrators are.
(Loud applause)
(Loud applause)
Then it was a European problem for certain States.
(Loud applause)
We witnessed yesterday a profoundly shocking event.
New York is a very special place.
It is a multi-cultural microcosm of the whole world.
We share the sense of shock and horror.
You are not isolated.
Language often fails us on these occasions.
(Loud applause)
Even the strongest nation of all is not invulnerable.
(Loud applause)
I am glad that it is taking place.
(Loud applause)
This will must be affirmed.
Cooperation is also required.
(Loud applause)
I therefore warmly thank you.
Terrorism does not come from the Moon.
We must break the taboo.
Israel must be part of the European Union.
We must take sustainable development seriously.
Our world will never be the same again.
(Loud applause)
That was a grave error.
The threat is real and takes many forms.
But, above all, it is insufficient.
Today, we must review this issue.
That remains to be seen.
(The sitting was closed at 6.10 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sittings
Are there any comments?
Yes, Mr Swoboda, of course.
(The Minutes were approved)
Tribute
Statement by the President
Thank you in advance.
Welcome
Combating terrorism
I would also like to welcome Commissioner Vitorino.
I shall now give the floor to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
(Applause)
Terrorism is not a recent phenomenon.
The Commission is proposing a two-fold response:
I believe there is room for improvement here.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
The time for words is now past!
We must act as Europeans.
(Applause)
What can be done to create our policy?
A series of contributions have been made here.
(Applause)
I welcome Commissioner Vitorino's statement.
We must give an external dimension to Eurojust.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We need global instruments to manage global problems.
International terrorism is a global phenomenon.
(Applause)
I welcome these responsible words.
There are so many unresolved conflicts!
There are so many destabilising forces!
This is an opportunity to be seized.
We must be aware of this.
I shall not elaborate any further.
We share in the grief and suffering of America.
I hope we can adopt this line in unison.
Is this request not somewhat mistimed?
I do not agree.
I believe that they are right.
We now have globalisation of terrorism.
Everyone is vulnerable.
That is the challenge.
This was called for back at Amsterdam.
For terrorism exists, fanaticism exists, injustice exists.
'Words must replace arms' as Mr Solana said.
There is documented evidence of this.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It has one, of course.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Terrorism creates a state of mind.
The EU is perceived as pro-Arab.
I regret this.
We should be pro-democracy.
That was the mood in America in Tuesday.
Will Europe support us?
That was really most difficult.
The European Union itself must also set to work.
Tampere was two years ago.
Does this bear any relation to colonial uprisings?
We all remember the Vietnam War, for example.
Thirty Austrians alone are missing to date.
They are not, however, short-term measures.
They will become effective in 2002 at the earliest.
The world economy is in bad shape.
These measures would have prevented many stock market crashes.
This is not economic laxity but good economic sense.
Luckily, we have the euro.
There is not only Europe, however.
There will be no development without trade.
Dialogue is the first step.
Such is the demand of the moment.
That is why it requires a worldwide response.
International financial consortia and multinational businesses too must cooperate.
But our strength lies in cooperation.
Terrorists are not nourished by religion or ideology.
Their hunger is called power.
Their weapons are fear and destruction.
They simply want civilian victims.
Because we owe a debt to all of them.
It has a common objective and method.
They have never wanted peace.
Allow me to describe it as such.
This horrific tragedy requires a response.
The citizen asks the government to take action.
We need stricter checks on luggage and hand luggage.
We need tighter checks on airport workers.
We must keep an eye on this situation.
My group rejects subsidies for airlines.
The situation can, of course, change.
Europe does not have the means.
Ladies and gentlemen, today everything has changed.
There must be no more of this.
I have to say, I doubt it.
In recent years, it has been progressively disarmed.
Mr President, I firmly condemn terrorist acts.
I would like to warn against this most emphatically.
That brings with it additional weighty responsibilities.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
Future of cohesion policy
This success is not purely coincidental.
The figures in the report speak for themselves.
Secondly, discrepancies will increase in extent.
This is not solely a question of money.
My second point concerns procedures for the future.
My second conviction is financial in nature.
We know that it is an important issue.
They are very necessary.
Clearly, this must change from 2006 onwards!
I will say a bit more about the proposals.
So I wholeheartedly support the principle of phasing out.
Quality must therefore come before quantity!
Differences would otherwise be markedly greater.
Too true!
Where are we in real terms?
At 1.06%.
It is also because of Parliament...
(The President cut the speaker off)
This was demonstrably false.
How can it be done?
How can it be achieved and with what instruments?
There is simply no other way of putting it.
This would probably be a solution to many conflicts.
That would be consistent.
Enlargement is a great challenge.
It is one of solidarity.
Let us not forget this fact.
This goes without saying.
This is a problem.
I listened to it very carefully.
I think they are particularly unfair.
Three years beforehand!
I have shown transparency.
I have shown openness with the European Parliament.
You talked about fraud.
Personally, I am extremely strict.
There are probably errors.
There are probably delays.
There are often irregularities.
These are a few examples of territorial objectives.
I agree.
I am open to this type of criticism.
It is accepted by all Member States.
Perhaps there has been a misunderstanding.
We are talking about another time and another era.
The debate is closed.
There was even a visible decrease.
Europe must have cohesion or it will not work.
These figures are extremely worrying.
This initiative has a political and a symbolic side.
.
However, we also have some criticisms.
This is precisely what this report does not do.
There is no ambiguity in this respect.
Does this mean that this policy has failed?
We are now facing the problems relating to enlargement.
Does the Cohesion Fund need to be modified?
Will the poorer regions stop receiving it?
Otherwise, the differences will increase.
But we are not the Court of Auditors.
And this is true in all respects.
It is a question worth asking.
Briefly, there are four lessons to be learned.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Female genital mutilation
The limit is the defence of human rights.
People can abandon their political ideas.
People can abandon their religious beliefs.
It is not solely a problem for African women.
The first is the right of asylum.
That is most important.
Here the vote was unanimous.
My second point, Mr President, concerns money.
Thank you very much, Mr Turco.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
More support must be given.
The EU is helping with DAPHNE.
Yet this is just a drop in the ocean.
The Liberal Group will therefore support the report.
I believe that to be appropriate.
The Koran too leaves no room for mutilation.
In this way, they become victims twice over.
We would not be doing our duty.
The same applies to refugee policy.
Religious leaders have a particular responsibility.
Europe should not lag behind in this respect.
They are asking us to show the same courage.
We are supported by women across the world.
There is therefore also a need to promote equality.
Information, awareness-raising and prevention must be the priorities.
Our solidarity and support are still needed.
This is a difficult, thorny problem.
What can the European Union do?
First, proposals and legislation.
The question of asylum.
The potential for educating and supporting immigrants.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Equal pay for work of equal value
This should therefore be addressed first.
The Member States need a guide.
So do the social partners.
This must be followed much more closely.
Inequality has thus already been established.
The situation is the same regarding consumer goods.
Perhaps we should begin with ourselves.
I recommend obtaining this Danish report.
I thought it was very interesting.
Let me draw attention to three points.
It is also known as part-time work.
Some countries think it is good for women.
Personally, I do not think so at all.
For there cannot be equal pay without economic equality.
So what can we do there?
It is in individual workplaces that experience is gained.
That is unacceptable.
The report rightly mentions value discrimination.
The report we are discussing is an initiative report.
No European country currently has such a law.
In drafting this own-initiative report, the European Parliament...
(The President cut the speaker off)
...
The second basic point concerns the guidelines for 2002.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Harassment in the work place
Yes.
What are the consequences of harassment?
What do we need to do?
The Lisbon Process also includes qualitative indicators.
Where does legislation come in?
Let me take an example from my own country.
Well done.
What can we do?
That would introduce a preventive stance.
I prefer this type of solution.
It is a difficult issue.
Victims feel ashamed, exploited and stressed.
Bullying causes all these problems.
This is what I call harassment in the workplace.
I congratulate Mr Andersson on his report.
We can accept this definition or any other.
It must be respected and protected' .
There are three aspects to this modern evil.
The real figure is far higher.
Yet it is a serious workplace problem.
Jan Andersson has submitted an outstanding report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Air pollution
Then came the Council' s collective standpoint.
It had become a pick-and-mix with something for everyone.
I would like to thank her too.
That is, in fact, too late.
I thank the Swedish Presidency.
I thank the Commission for its constructive support.
The point I want to make is this.
There should at least be some advice on that.
That is ridiculous.
It is not going to be easy.
There is a long time scale.
In fact the opposite is true.
That would clearly have meant a step backwards.
These two directives are obviously in this category.
However, we have not been entirely successful.
This is a short-sighted view.
The Commission is pleased with the outcome.
I look forward to Parliament's support for CAFE.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's session have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr Santini, that will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr De Rossa, we have noted your comments.
We will put forward your suggestion.
Decisions on freezing assets or evidence
Isolationist sovereignty makes crime easier and helps criminals.
Mr bin Laden has a London bank account.
This is one small part of that process.
Nor does it cover terrorist acts.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
External borders and Schengen
Secondly, there is a lack of transparency.
However, the results have been disappointing.
My fifth point concerns Schengen cooperation and police cooperation.
I should like to list three.
That is where Schengen really takes things too far.
These practices bring back some bitter memories.
That was the message.
In fact Schengen is a rather special animal.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Refugee status in Member States
Let me explain briefly what I mean.
I appeal to you yet again!
I know this is a difficult issue.
I also know this is a sensitive issue.
Welcome
Refugee status in Member States (continuation)
Madam President, Europe is running two risks.
That is not want we want either.
We are in absolute agreement on this.
The committee has guaranteed this scope.
This report enables us to go somewhat further.
They are asking to be accepted here.
Thank you for your report.
However, we also need supplementary measures.
This ignores the reality.
We must not adopt any unrealistic measures.
This does not imply that we have different objectives.
Our objectives are the same.
The Commission's proposal meets this requirement.
I particularly welcome two provisions proposed by the Commission.
These asylum requests cannot be resolved collectively.
Thank you, Madam President.
So this cycle is now complete.
What is more, these three texts are interlinked.
Other proposals will have to be taken into consideration.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
That is a case of harassment at the workplace.
You are absolutely right.

We are all distressed and saddened by this attack.
Speeches relating to points of order:
Onesta (Verts/ALE).

He has paid the ultimate price for his bravery.
It is important that we make that distinction.

It is this that I ask of you.

Agenda
Secondly, the political issue.
I hope that this text will receive broad support.
(Parliament gave its assent)
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
The others were replaced.
And the Socialist Group was duly and worthily represented.
Relating to Thursday:
We shall naturally participate in this vote.
(Applause from the ELDR Group)
As I said, I have received three requests.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Speeches relating to points of order (continued):
These are words which do nothing to promote dialogue.
That is my point of order.
Let me first congratulate you on it.
(Interruption by Mr Schultz)
Mr Schultz, I did not interrupt you.
I would ask you at least to be polite.
Clearly, politeness was not part of your education.
Why are you getting so het up?
The left-wing democrats are in trouble.
Madam President, on a point of order.
This is a very serious matter.
This company is also in serious difficulty.
Thank you, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
Both of us represent the same constituency.
There is a serious matter.
The situation is extremely grave.
It is a real tragedy.
Accident at AZF, Toulouse, and EU environmental policy
I shall now give the floor to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
The last updates were made in 2000 and 2001.
The last inspection took place in May 2001.
Internal and external emergency plans were in place.
Let me now come to the follow-up.
We should move forward with this amendment.
We must improve how the system works.
We often talk of 'zero risk' .
What you said is important.
This was insufficient.
Several things will need to be implemented.
First of all, we need resources.
The factory that exploded produced fertilisers.
We should not be satisfied with purely cosmetic measures.
We need political measures.
The entire situation has changed.
We must draw the obvious conclusions from that.
Inspection bodies must publish their results.
Toulouse needs financial and logistical aid.
Will this require exceptional emergency funds?
'Never again!'
And they would be right to do so.
The issue today is town and country planning.
And the countries must accept it.
What happened there is unimaginable.
The disaster in Toulouse is hugely revealing.
There is no safety programme in place.
An overhaul of European legislation is essential.
We must have a risk prevention policy.
The liability of policymakers must also be confirmed.
It would appear not.
The Seveso I directive represented a huge step forwards.
TotalFinaElf must pay.
Indeed, Never again!
Legislation cannot solve all of these problems.
This plant was established in the 1920s.
We will continue to offer our help and assistance.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Environmental noise
What the European Parliament wants is an all-round approach.
We desperately need European noise standards pertaining to aircraft.
The tyre directive is a case in point.
These technical advances must be incorporated in European policy.
There are currently fifty-one different methods used in Europe.
The Environmental Committee has offered to pick those up.
Somewhat less high noise levels should also be measured.
But that is not enough.
The action campaigns must also aim to reduce noise.
So what is it about?
It is about measuring noise.
The population has everything to do with this.
That has nothing to do with offering slots.
That should in itself not be problematic.
The same applies to the action plans.
Information is another point.
We think this is very important.
I believe that a time limit is needed here.
I suspect that made a hell of a din.
That may be the case.
We should not be setting standards for these things.
A separate problem is aircraft noise.
The question is whether this long wait is desirable.
I do not think so.
There is a need for more research on this.
Who could make the traffic on this street quieter!
This attention must lead to specific measures.
I am however, rather surprised.
These are decisions for locally elected representatives.
We are told about airports, for example.
The impact of noise is, therefore, different.
I agree with Mr Florenz.
Management is, therefore, preceded by an assessment.
Noise regulations must allow flexibility.
Do we compete in terms of geography?
Indeed it is to be welcomed.
I would like to mention another point.
I would appreciate a Commission response.
That has got us into difficulties on this issue.
That is therefore no longer a point of discussion.
We have taken note of this.
The debate is closed.
What is this compromise about?
I do not like this system.
This system should not be supported.
If so, they should think again.
The cumulative effect contributes significantly to air pollution.
It has made the investment.
But is that not what we want overall?
Chainsaws are vital for managing woodlands.
Ordinary people have suspected this for many years.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Expiry of ECSC Treaty
and
The Research Fund would be managed by the Commission.
Mr President, Mr Turchi deserves our agreement.
I must say, they really have a nerve!
Back to the matter in hand.
This is sensible, but it does create problems.
I mentioned this contradiction at the outset.
I hope that Parliament will agree to this recommendation.
We have some experience of this in Germany.
I recommend that we should not vote on them.
This really is a mistake.
It is quite extraordinary that we have this situation.
Therefore health and safety should be our foremost concern.
Mr. Linkohr, this is a dubious proposal.
We must be clear about that.
Your Commission originally rested on a different legal foundation.
I think it is worth mentioning this.
Eventually all stakeholders endorsed it.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
(The sitting was closed at 8.55 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
Roure (PSE), rapporteur.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
White paper on reform of European governance
We have been pursuing this commitment constantly and consistently.
It is thus much more than simply the co-legislator.
Governance is already a part of that debate.
It must lead to specific proposals for action.
This is essential.
However, swift action does not mean rushing.
There is also a second important issue here.
So what is needed?
Joint regulation?
Open coordination?
To what extent are European agencies needed?
The decision-making processes must be simplified and made clearer.
What, precisely, can be done about this?
We cannot afford to fail.
The White Paper is now under consideration.
Parliament will produce a report.
We look forward to seeing part two.
I am very much in favour of that.
I certainly regard that as a very good proposal.
Let us have more referendums in all Member States.
That is the only way to achieve democratic legitimacy.
Is the solution in keeping with European democracy?
Can people be held to account?
Rather, it is democracy which creates legitimacy.
That is not our idea of democracy.
Clarity always remains condition No 1.
We count on you, Mr Prodi.
We ought to look at that point.
That is not our understanding of parliamentary democracy.
I am sorry that Mr Farage has left.
He obviously does not believe in parliamentary democracy.
He wants a referendum every five minutes.
This is a job that elected politicians should do.
It certainly does that.
Mr President, I have three points.
That is where we should all start.
We have to reform our governmental processes.
We cannot afford not to address these issues.
This will not be a resource-free exercise.
The Commission has to face this.
That is how we should approach this debate.
I have a problem with this wording.
Your report talks about leadership.
Yet that is what we need.
(Applause)
That is not because they are bad.
I was disappointed in President Prodi's White Paper.
He virtually neglected the role of the ombudsman.
We must make sure that we have good administration.
We want to listen to citizens.
But what if it were not very good?
That is a very welcome development.
Let us not confuse this with plurality of presence.
Anyway, today we have made some progress.
The Commission is willing to examine this path.
This, to me, is a step forward.
Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
Thank you very much, Mr Prodi!
I think that really does make things clearer.
Asylum and immigration
Let me take asylum first of all.
How can we manage migratory flows successfully?
(Applause)
We have already buckled down to this task.
Secondly, we cannot deny that immigration occurs.
Slogans will not resolve the immigration problem.
How will this make the system better?
I commend the report to Parliament.
Let us look at the three groups first.
What are the core issues in my report?
.
But they do need support.
In that way, conflict could be prevented.
With regard to immigration we cannot talk of subsidiarity.
Why is that?
Let me explain.
I have a clear answer to that: no!
Both define a clear path to be followed.
We also need consistency.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Naturally, he has been debriefed by the CIA.
That goes without saying.
This is appealing and necessary.
So much the better.
(Applause from the right)
Anything going beyond that will not be accepted.
Some revision is needed here.
The problem of asylum is with the procedure.
So we need to get the procedure under control.
I wish you the best of luck, Commissioner.
A responsible compromise must be struck.
Secondly, the immigration system must be flexible.
Firstly, it contains a series of commonplaces.
Mr Pirker's report deplores family reunification.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We do not accept this.
(Applause from the right)
I am not so sure.
The rapporteur took all this into consideration.
This has already been discussed here in Parliament.
It is not the same.
In that respect I welcome Mr Vitorino's statements.
They are not simply doing it for pleasure.
How is this to be interpreted?
In several EU countries, Muslims have been persecuted.
Quite a few politicians have made astounding statements.
That is a prejudiced and irresponsible statement.
Is Europe not in danger of losing its diversity?
Otherwise, gather your belongings together and go!'
I wonder if Mr Camre might respond to this.
This is no longer acceptable.
How is Europe' s population going to develop?
Will the situation be the same everywhere?
Does immigration have to be subject to conditions?
They have confidence in Europe.
I would now like to make three points.
The Pirker report has the merit of being frank.
Article 23 could not be clearer.
But the world has moved on.
Mass air travel has facilitated unprecedented migratory flows.
We can no longer receive asylum seekers with dignity.
In our cities we have families living under canvas.
This is absolutely unacceptable.
The review is now underway.
There are also proposals on combating illegal immigration.
(Applause)
I will not permit any further discussion of this.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTE

I ask you to vote in favour of it.
(Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution.)
.
We have therefore voted against these two reports.
Arms exports
There is much greater transparency in arms controls policies.
Action in this field must be an absolute priority.
The European Union has reacted adequately and coherently.
Here too we require a new international coalition.
What will happen to the export of encryption software?
Will new arrangements be made in this connection?
Only then will it be truly effective.
This is completely unacceptable.
Lastly, the candidate countries.
That must be changed.
I agree with the definitional point he made.
There is no such thing as a good terrorist.
There is no distinction between good and bad terrorism.
What is a terrorist?
That is not justified.
It is never justified.
This marks a first step in tackling the issue.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Political and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan
The main purposes of the Troika visit were three-fold.
Those sort of rights are universally valid.
But it is actually true.
Nothing will ever be quite the same again.
I should like to make one other point.
We understand the difficulties.
I will finish my remarks with that point.
We, as Europe, must do more.
We cannot cross the borders.
UNHCR and WFP are in the same boat.
We will need to take action in Iran.
We will need to do this as Europe.
They are dallying and dithering.
You are dividing the world into two.
We have always supported NGOs.
We have perhaps given less interinstitutional support.
We must do all we can to help.
It is extremely dangerous to grant the necessary aid.
What is that relationship not?
Let us be clear about that too.
It does not aim to arm the Northern Alliance.
Allow me to quote three examples.
That is not acceptable.
My concern is the political response.
Central Asia is a vulnerable and very fragile region.
And what do we do?
This is my urgent plea.
The cancer of terrorism.
But this must not be a purely Anglo-Saxon affair.
When will we learn that is our war too?
But what is being done in comparison?
Let us be firm and decisive.
They were all there on 11 September.
I had to cancel the trip.
Winter is approaching.
So humanitarian aid now faces a really scary challenge.
USD 120 million is required immediately.
That is how it must be.
So this is more than just food aid.
Then this terrible act of terrorism took place.
We reacted immediately with an additional EUR 4 million.
Now our response has to go beyond this.
We will be asking for more money.
Funds are channelled through Afghan NGOs and UN agencies.
This is not the problem.
The red tape here is minimal.
Protection was mentioned.
Here we are in a terrible dilemma.
But this is extremely difficult.
Mr Belder mentioned the export of drugs.
This is the line to take.
Thank you for your patience.
This is an extremely demanding situation.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
Guidelines for the trans-European transport network
We thank you for presenting it now.
I can endorse what Mr Jarzembowski said.
Might we perhaps put this experience to use?
Those are my two questions.
That was my first question.
Firstly, I will reply to Mr Jarzembowski.
This is a fundamental issue.
Mr Ripoll therefore has the floor.
So where did you get that 10% from?
Secondly, the environmental impact.
Second issue.
Third issue.
The citizens want enlargement to build visible bridges.
Mr President, many thanks to Mr Varela.
There is no railway.
We are talking about high figures.
Thank you very much, Madam Vice-President.
That concludes this item on the agenda.
Question Time (Commission)
Mr Vitorino represents the Commission.
Part I
Question No 27 by (H-0700/01):
Question No 28 by (H-0730/01):
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you.
.
Question 29 by (H-0737/01):
Thank you for your answer.
We will move on to the second part.
A very good afternoon, Mr Bolkestein.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Bolkestein
Question No 30 by (H-0707/01):
The Commission services are currently checking this information.
Thank you for your information, Commissioner.
Question No 31 by (H-0728/01):
Question No 32 by (H-0750/01):
This second procedure was closed when Greece complied.
What will the Commission's next move be?
Just so that our citizens know where they stand.
That underlines the importance of this issue.
But we are in the European Parliament.
Question No 33 by (H-0738/01):
Questions to Commissioner Verheugen
Mr President, my answer is as follows.
We know we can count on you.
I hope that will be to his satisfaction.
Question No 35 by (H-0695/01):
The law thus appears to work satisfactorily.
It should also concern rights and facts.
I thank the Commissioner for his answer.
Question No 37 by (H-0743/01):
Questions to Commissioner De Palacio
The quote is directly from him.
It is precisely what the Copenhagen criteria require.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Mr President, on a point of order.
It is a disgrace.
President.
Question No 43 by (H-0710/01):
I was not entirely satisfied with the reply.
Question No 47 by (H-0746/01):
This matter does not come within our competence.
Thirdly, sustainable mobility.
In many cases the origins go beyond transport policy.
Question No 48 by (H-0747/01):
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
That concludes Question Time.
Conclusions of the UN Conference on Racism
That was what was achieved at Durban.
Of course, we cannot forget the past.
We value their help in formulating and applying policy.
However, we must not rest on our laurels.
What could we expect from the Durban Conference?
What lessons can we learn from this?
The second trap is the issue of reparations.
Some people wanted a list to be drawn up.
This point will feature in the joint resolution.
That requires a united front.
That is something to celebrate.
Admittedly, however, the conference did start badly.
Firstly, there was the NGO forum.
This lack of honesty detracted from the conference.
That success was realised.
Words have meaning.
Who was hijacking whom?
Why?
For what purpose?
And this is something that Parliament cannot play down.
We owe at least this to the African continent.
We have a responsibility to do this as well.
I regret the withdrawal of the American delegation.
Those who participated in Durban deserve great credit.
No, certainly not.
That is regrettable, of course.
Durban may be a start.
This would amount to the prevention of racism!
I seek progress in immigration policy as well.
This is an opportunity for our European Union.
This was a perfidious strategy.
This would represent a victory for the terrorists.
So let us not allow it to happen!
Let us be an example.
Let us continue to be open and tolerant.
We here can do something against racism.
Let us act accordingly and give an example.
These developments are most worrying.
What, then, should have been discussed?
What did all this political talk crowd out?
And, unfortunately, this is what happened.
We reject this pointless exercise.
I think that it was perfectly natural.
Yes, they naturally lack a number of points.
This was the case at the Durban conference.
And that is something that I cannot accept.
This concept is certainly present in the texts.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Vehicles designed to carry more than eight passengers
Madam President, I welcome everybody here again tonight.
I see a good number of familiar faces.
I would like to convey their thanks to Parliament.
I fully understand and appreciate that.
For once we would be making a difference.
The buses are only part of it.
What about the principles?
It will go through tomorrow.
So we will not be obstructing it.
That is absolutely the right approach.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
GALILEO
Let me quote some of the main arguments.
That can surely not be the intention.
Fourthly: GALILEO creates employment in Europe.
Why, then, is GALILEO vital for Europe?
Europe is capable of developing its own system.
Financing needs should be met by 2002.
We Europeans have no real rights of access.
I believe that requires no further explanation.
There is not only good in the world.
The European Union is a major power.
We must be aware of this situation.
The Council must certainly be made aware of this.
First of all, the management structure.
There must be a balance.
That is exactly what makes the system first-rate.
A report has been drawn up.
That too took up a lot of time.
Let me start with the technology.
That is absolutely not the case.
GPS is a similar system.
No problem whatsoever.
It is somewhat inappropriate, in my opinion.
It appears that there are actually no business partners.
One and a half billion must be coughed up.
Secondly, I also have concerns about finance.
That is 13%.
In fact, the problem is not insignificant.
I have no doubts about that.
Technical progress is ever more rapid.
Thank you, Mrs De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
Energy efficiency labelling for office equipment
It is a small part of what is needed.
That is a more pragmatic approach towards achieving improvements.
This is a healthy and sensible approach.
The key thing is to use energy well.
Thank you, Mrs De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy
That is why we should use benchmarking.
Innovation also means repeatedly taking risks, however.
Innovation must start in the small units.
We also need new systems in schools, however.
ISO 9000 is already taken for granted in firms.
But enterprises also need easier access to funding.
Innovation is the key to this.
Specifically, it means changing our systems of education.
Research needs to be integrated into operating structures.
I hope we have all learned something from that.
Market-oriented attraction is preferable.
The rapporteur also underlines the importance of education.
Enterprise can be promoted early among schoolchildren and students.
It is a significant factor in innovation.
We could of course ask him what innovation?
What innovation is most in demand at the moment?
Is that the kind of innovation we mean?
Or do we not need to define innovation?
And how will we get there?
Do you know, Commissioner?
Where are we heading?
Questions on a good report.
Nevertheless, once again congratulations, Paul!
I will focus on the productivity gap.
But change is important and positive.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Exhaustion of trade mark rights
We could also speak about the advertising effect.
There is something wrong there.
Then there are the following points.
For example, you order 'a Siemens' .
Different studies can produce different results.
I am speaking as someone concerned with consumer affairs.
However, the matter cannot rest here.
Nevertheless I salute him.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Announcement by the President
We shall look into this matter extremely carefully.
The terrorist threat is a test for European integration.
The fourth series of measures involves air safety.
I would like to thank Mr Michel.
Now is also the time to reiterate this.
Let me say a last word on this subject.
(Applause)
This must be repeated again and again!
I would counsel strongly against any inappropriate rhetoric!
We now need more of Europe.
We need to cooperate with Russia.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned Ghent.
We support what you have said.
(Applause)
(Applause)
This is already happening.
I believe we should respect the activities of others.
I am addressing my colleague Mr Poettering too.
This has to come back to Parliament.
I should like to highlight one point.
The Convention is required to present proposals.
(Applause from the left)
These were not dealt with properly at Nice.
Many measures will be needed in the coming months.
I agree with him.
That would certainly be one answer.
But let me be clear about one point.
We must all work together.
They cost us dear.
He strongly emphasised the value of dialogue.
We are currently endeavouring to forge an anti-terrorist coalition.
That is an aspect we must bear in mind.
The other issue is the Arab world.
But these are all secondary issues.
Overall, we approve the Council's conclusions.
That brings me to my main point.
All this is not pure chance.
Everyone knows that.
Obviously you will all say 'no' .
(The President cut the speaker off)
People are shocked.
People expect their governments to guarantee their safety.
We hold to our treaty commitments.
They are in the best interests of us all.
Europe has been there.
Europe has been at war.
Europe has experience of being a theatre of war.
Conflicts cannot be prevented with weapons.
I wish to endorse what other speakers have said.
However, there are problems in the alliance.
His name is Massoud" .
We are united in our fate.
The security instruments must be comprehensively reinforced.
The improvement of international relations also strengthens international security.
Several Members raised this matter.
It must not be exponential.
I believe we have to remember that.
We would be more radical.
I can do no more.
Those are the ideas now on the table.
The next question is how to involve civil society.
Of course, I agree with him.
You all know my views on this.
We will get there in the end.
So I support those who call for guarantees.
We must nevertheless continue to bring it up.
This was accepted.
I heard them clearly.
We must cancel the developing countries' debt.
We must resume our work on light arms trafficking.
Yesterday the Commission proposed a new initiative.
What kind of presidency will the Union have?
In Ghent, enlargement will also be discussed.
Mr President, war is not the answer.
It is the end that justifies the means.
I see these resolutions overall in a positive light.
Let us make use of this opportunity without delay!
These remarks, then, must be withdrawn.
We can expect Mr Nielson to apologise for them.
Its one dream seemed to be comfort and peace.
Europe suddenly felt vulnerable and unprepared.
This violent and anti-modernist proselytism is anti-Western by definition.
But, now what?
That is obvious.
But how is it to do so?
What are its priorities beyond fighting relentlessly against terrorism?
What are the new aims of the European project?
Declarations of intent must be followed by practical action.
They therefore resort to the advantages offered by globalisation.
This is not an argument for business as usual.
I condemn utterly the statements by Prime Minister Berlusconi.
I would add my voice to others' condemnations.
The question is how do we respond?
Let us not disappoint them any longer.
There is a burning need to fulfil that obligation.
I have in mind genuine democratic values.
Indeed, we think the problem lies elsewhere.
They are increasingly total wars.
I wish you the best of luck in Ghent.
It is therefore crucial to get it right.
That is inopportune under these circumstances.
This is also relevant to enlargement.
They must be given their place.
That is not what I want.
Speaking of that convention...
It is a matter of responsible behaviour and manners.
I will come to a close soon.
We have to learn from earlier weaknesses or failures.
The same has happened under other circumstances.
(Applause)
Mr President, my card has disappeared.
The debate is closed.
This is not a new thing, though.
Somebody must do something about this sound system.
Announcement by the President
Are there any objections?
Then it is decided to postpone the deadline.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
VOTE
Are there any objections?
(Parliament adopted the request for urgent procedure)
There is no need to repeat it.
Thank you for your contribution, however.
Please would you send your proposal to the President.

Congratulations to all of you.

Conditions vary widely from one airport to another.
So evaluation comes before management.

Joint resolution on the accident in Toulouse
.
Evans Robert J.E. report (A5-0304/2001)
How many applications are unfounded?
Probably nine out of ten.
This underestimate is made deliberately.
It allows the problem to be minimised.
In fact it is immense.
All this is totally ill-timed.
.
However, it is still a wish list.
.
Pirker report (A5-0305/2001)
I voted against this report.
It sends out the wrong signals.
This whole policy is completely restrictive.
However, there are negative aspects.
That is inherently racist and we should oppose it.
(The President cut the speaker off)
.
To be specific, we need:
to combat human trafficking gangs;
This is not our opinion either.
.
We must show some instinct for survival.
It closes its eyes and ignores the evil.
So what are its solutions?
We are critical of parts of the report.
The second departure is more distressing.
Titley report (A5-0309/2001)

Langenhagen report (A5-0288/2001)
We have therefore voted against this report.

There are plenty of reasons for this.
RÃ¼big report (A5-0234/2001)
Naturally I support these proposals.
Innovation cannot exist without the SMEs.
Alas, little progress has been achieved.

This will promote more start-ups and new ventures.
Mayer report (A5-0311/2001)
Joint resolution on racism (RC B5-0605/2001)
.
For these reasons, I voted for the resolution.
.
The European Union should have taken a similar view.
That concludes voting time.
Welcome
We are facing difficult times.
(Applause)
I was leading a Belgian economic mission to Morocco.
We must hold such a debate during our presidency.
These methods should be used in future stability programmes.
Firstly, the economic situation.
Secondly, the financing of terrorism.
The risks should therefore be manageable.
I have in mind in particular the Lisbon agenda.
Such discussions have been held at regular intervals.
A wide range of instruments should be drawn upon.
That was the first demand.
These pillars must not be shaken.
Why can they not agree to that?
Why not just agree to it then?
We need measures against money laundering.
You spoke about that, Commissioner.
Why not agree to that?
Why can they not agree to that?
That is the Socialist policy mix.
But in reality they do not.
It had proved necessary to revise some forecasts downwards.
The Council representative said just this to the House.
We must also respond in the short term.
Economic stabilisers can have a role to play.
I do not wish to engage in ideological debate.
We are not calling for state aid.
Nor are we calling for quick-fix solutions.
Terrorism does not represent any civilisation.
Terrorism negates everything that is human.
These are the people we must respond to.
Alternatively, it could lead to inequitable public spending.
I think it is time we recognise this.
You advocate strengthening coordination between national policies.
I am sure you will confirm this.
Funds to promote investment should also be established.
However, we want something more than this.
We want reform.
Two principles should guide us in this.
Public or mixed economy choices should balance market forces.
Fortunately, the Belgian Presidency has suggested this.
It was killed off by the European Central Bank.
We are all aware of the results.
This is not the right response to the situation.
We have consistently pointed this out.
Firstly, these countries already have significant budgetary deficits.
This is already causing revival.
Further budgetary expansion would have no purpose.
It is having a recessionary effect in these countries.
That would be truly paradoxical!
It is no good waiting.
There is no denying that.
Nice words, nice ambitions, nice vision.
But some things seem to be self-explanatory.
However, that is not the issue.
Are we forecasting a slump, yes or no?
Some say, wait and see what happens.
I fail to understand why.
We have no scientific answer.
We are dogmatic.
Job losses are mounting in the airline industry.
Various Member States are entering the danger zone.
The reverse is also true.
Budgetary discipline will be crucial in obtaining this stability.
Rather, it is a crisis of confidence.
Obviously, we all want to grow.
We believe that our recipes will move us forward.
That would hole consumer confidence below the water line.
Previously the Commissioner stated it was not possible.
Now it begins to appear probable.
I requested it myself.
I then described the nature of the ongoing debate.
I am sure that this debate will continue.
This is my first point.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Controlling and streamlining public spending are worthy objectives.
We do not believe that liberalisation is a panacea.
That cannot work.
This is the ninth rate cut this year.
That is our right.
Quite the reverse, in fact.
And he is right.
I think he is very much mistaken.
This criticism fails to take account of the facts.
They cannot blame this on the European Central Bank.
Let us turn those tools against them.
Many bankers and finance workers died in that attack.
That is not at all the case.
There is scope for more public investment.
Hence there is no question of dogmatism or fundamentalism.
We may well be regretting that just now.
Rather, the nature of the pact provides accordingly.
Would an approach involving greater spending resolve the problems?
I do not believe it would.
Some of you have argued along the same lines.
More Europe means Lisbon.
More Europe means more efficient systems.
There is no doubt about that.
Unfortunately however, we are running out of time.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Television without frontiers
That is not a healthy situation.
This should feature prominently in the new directive.
I believe she was wise to do so.
A large majority of Parliament backed this view.
But what has happened since then?
It provides sensible conditions for international broadcasting.
Please note I am talking about an approach.
The audiovisual sector has undergone profound changes.
I have a number of concerns on this matter.
These are the difficult issues confronting us.
We should offer them a warm welcome.
We agree with you.
I wish it well.
It is very important that we hold this debate.
This process is already under way.
The process will continue next year.
Members of Parliament were also invited to these workshops.
Plans are afoot for further workshops.
This is an inaccurate assessment of the situation.
The directive has a much wider scope.
The comments made in Recital H are therefore mistaken.
This may also pose problems for candidate countries.
I shall say more about them later.
Thank you very much, Mrs Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0689/01):
The Council will ensure these matters are monitored.
Are any figures available on this?
Question No 2 by (H-0690/01):
Question No 3 by (H-0691/01):
Efforts are under way.
Mr MacCormick, did you want to add anything?
My question was implicit: does the Minister agree?
Yes!
That is clearly the case here.
Thank you very much, Mr Bautista Ojeda.
So in the future please try to ask questions.
At least give the impression of asking a question.
Mrs Korhola has the floor for a supplementary question.
Question No 6 by (H-0699/01):
First, do these plans for Morocco include Turkey?
Hordes of illegal immigrants can hardly pass by unnoticed.
What has the Council done about this?
I can only repeat what I have just said.
Question No 7 by (H-0705/01):
Thank you for your reply.
I can only repeat what I have just said.
That does not answer my question.
How will that person later be located?
That is a matter for the Member State.
Question No 8 by (H-0715/01):
I believe that it refers to Finland.
I am sorry I missed that one.
I can only repeat what I said.
Question No 9 by (H-0717/01):
What progress is expected to be made?
This resolution was adopted on 20 April this year.
Question No 10 by (H-0719/01):
It is making an impact with the citizens.
(Protests from Mr Andrews)
The reply of the President-in-Office is clear.
That is rather a personal point.
Question No 11 by (H-0720/01):
The Italian government suspended the Schengen Agreement.
Question No 12 by (H-0724/01):
I sincerely apologise for writing in Greek.
You have rectified the situation.
Question No 13 by (H-0721/01):
Where is that report?
Question No 14 by (H-0722/01):
It remains the reference instrument par excellence.
Forgive me for using an economic term.
In addition, children must be protected.
These are all scourges which affect them particularly cruelly.
Was this pure coincidence?
That is a very philosophical question, Mr SacrÃ©deus.
That is your own assessment, Mr President.
I asked specific questions about the concept of family.
I asked the Belgian Presidency specific questions.
Philosophy and ethics are important issues even for you.
I have accepted your question.
There is no problem.
Two other Members also wanted to speak.
We usually reply question by question.
I have given you some information on this issue.
I thank the President-in-Office for her answer.
What are your priorities here?
I am not going to make any judgment.
Question No 16 by (H-0727/01):
What measures does it intend to take?
It is a disgrace, an absolute disgrace!
But that is by the by.
My question concerns Leyla Zanna.
A Sacharov prizewinner, one of us.
You are a member of the Belgian Parliament.
She is a member of the Turkish national assembly.
Perhaps simultaneous interpretation problems are to blame here.
I have been very clear in my answers.
We are doing our homework.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
This is what the changeover to the euro represents.
Why?
What does this mean?
Nor is it any reason to start panicking.
However, you know that too.
That is not what is at stake here!
Essentially, it is about something quite different.
I cannot imagine that that is what you want.
We have tabled amendments that we think are sensible.
Hence the amendments we have tabled.
What has caused this increase in government expenditure?
No, it certainly is not!
I shall of course be voting against this report.
We must look to the future.
There are, however, situations which require coordination.
The Commission mentions resistance to shocks as an example.
This does nothing to help the case for coordination.
Rarely does one see such excellent reports.
I wish to focus on two matters.
We could have achieved a totally different outcome.
This is unacceptable and must be condemned.
One feels far closer to this in Brussels.
I am therefore pleased with Mrs BerÃ¨s' report.
This concludes my comments on the BerÃ¨s report.
This is a key element of our model.
We must go further than specific analysis.
The same can be said of the UMTSs.
And each process took a different route.
We are grateful for your reference to tax reductions.
That is the oral amendment I was referring to.
I believe that is the complete list.
He has probably been waiting for this all evening.
It was a slightly hectic month.
It was not a matter of content.
I did the same in my report.
That was a personal statement and was helpfully reconciliatory.
The debate is closed.
Competition policy (2000)
Our committee has also underlined other competition concerns.
The Agag Longo report rightly mentions this.
There are plenty of examples.
Coal is valued because supplies are secure.
So we could go on.
Thank you very much, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
E-commerce and financial services
There is a lot still to do.
Of course, there are real difficulties.
This is a very good report.
The Internet is growing in importance.
Trade over the Internet is growing more and more.
Our target is the year 2005.
I still have myself.
Parliament will also be making its position known tomorrow.
I commend this report to the House.
I have one comment to make.
First of all the scope for national policy.
The country-of-origin principle respects national legislation.
Otherwise, confidence in e-trade will not grow.
Perhaps we should no longer do that so often.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Internal market strategy for services
Both of us have emphasised that here.
A vote will be taken on the amendments tomorrow.
Now to my own report, however.
But we have no time to lose.
We now have the remedy of treaty infringement proceedings.
Discussions in the Council took a very long time.
We should not rule any instrument out.
We will need further harmonisation.
Unfortunately, things are not like that.
Therefore, this communication is extremely welcome.
Again, these provisions will help.
I refer back to the country-of-origin principle.
They are going to demand them from other countries.
This is not a question of harmonising down.
The first phase is now being carried out.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Pre-contractual information on home loans
What is this report about?
A few points are still outstanding here.
We also need similar forms throughout Europe.
We also need comparability of data.
It now requires critical appraisal and monitoring.
That is with the Commission as a notary.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
I shall not abuse the Rule.
In any case, we freely expressed an opinion.
Mr President, a further personal statement.
The matter is now closed.
General product safety
Monitoring measures will therefore be very important.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
The market cannot be regulated.
I fully support this objective.
The report makes no secret of this fact.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Poverty reduction (combating the major transmissible diseases)
and
This is the reality!
So there is a mistake in paragraph 14.
These are minor changes.
And medicines are often unavailable altogether.
They are either non-existent or too expensive.
Firstly, we propose a system of differentiated pricing.
Secondly, there is the matter of patents.
Rapporteur Khanbhai mentioned the great importance of these.
It must primarily be a task for public bodies.
Many ambiguities still remain, however.
An interim working group has been implemented.
It will make proposals in the next few days.
The principle is therefore now established.
What does this mean in specific terms?
On the contrary.
We cannot leave this to the free market.
We must not only concentrate on medicine.
Thirdly, everyone should have access to treatment.
At present, they are not available.
Since then, however, nothing much has happened.
Economically speaking, this is possible.
And what is the EU doing?
Yet this is still the crucial issue.
This is an issue of fundamental social justice.
Results will not be achieved without large-scale information campaigns.
The cause of this situation is simple.
And we do not want that.
I therefore support the measures proposed.
Policy direction is an important instrument here.
But in the South the picture is very different.
That is the scene confronting us.
That is a human disaster.
We are facing human disasters in America now.
We must have adequate education, monitoring and research.
TB too, of course, is a killer.
Otherwise, we will also lose credibility.
Some day we will realise this.
The drug companies are our partners.
But it is crucial that they act with integrity.
They will not say.
They will not commit themselves.
They just will not answer.
Name one NGO which supports that position.
It was publicly-funded research.
Let us have some clear speaking in this debate.
(Applause from the left)
Why is there not a similar response?
A holistic strategy is therefore required to combat them.
A similar approach has also been adopted in Uganda.
This is a major problem.
This is the economic framework before us.
Their experience is that very little has been possible.
That warning has to be taken seriously.
Our programme for action has been moving forward.
All this work is taking place.
Now a few remarks on financial allocations.
We would like to get away from input-related targets.
This is definitely something that must be done.
This should comprise all essential and key medicines.
Total contributions have now reached USD 1.8 billion.
Mrs SandbÃ¦k mentioned the issue of testing.
I thank them from the bottom of my heart.
This is progressing quite well.
I want to give some additional information here.
Many issues are therefore, being discussed now.
I thank the rapporteur, Mr Khanbai.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at noon.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
I am sorry, that is the rule.
Yes, it is in Rule 137:
International terrorism (C5-0455/2001)
We cannot be neutral against terror.
Women in particular have suffered.
On what criteria were these people selected?
Presumption of innocence?
Benefit of the doubt?
And who has the burden of proof?
.
Even suspected criminals are entitled to fair trials.
.
I do not agree with this ill-considered approach.
No such provision is envisaged here.
Extraordinary European Council (RC B5-0666/2001)
I voted against the resolution for several reasons.
.
Stability and Growth Pact (RC B5-0602/2001)
The collapse of liberal dogmas is becoming increasingly apparent.
Japan is now experiencing a recession.
Hieronymi Report (A5-0286/2001)
Below are the three most important points:
BerÃ¨s Report (A5-0307/2001)
I fully support this objective.
Paragraph 2:
Recital B:
The reasons for this are no mystery.
Who should pay?
Capitalist companies or consumers through VAT?
Who should benefit more from budgetary spending?
Public services or private employers?
.
Peijs report (A5-0306/2001)
.
Longo report (A5-0299/2001)
.
It is also concerned with abolishing state aid.
Huhne report (A5-0301/2001)
Yet this is quite absurd.
Berger report (A5-0310/2001)
Khanbai report (A5-0263/2001)
.
The report makes a number of good points.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The first should be to the government of Macedonia.
That is the way to solve problems involving minorities.
The second point is the country's integrity.
Thirdly, this is a multiethnic state.
Its status must be enhanced.
The NLA has been dissolved, so it claims.
It includes those who want it.
I still assume that most Albanians want it.
I also assume that most Macedonians want it.
Macedonia is a state.
That is something which is extremely dangerous.
Obviously, there are reasons for this.
We must ask ourselves why this is happening.
That must not happen.
I think we should make a fine distinction here.
We say and we hope that it did.
How were the numbers calculated?
We hope they will make progress.
We must invest in the stability of the Balkans.
We must invest in the stability of Macedonia.
We must provide good guidance for refugees returning home.
We must see to the re-building of that country.
And so amnesty for the revolutionaries is indeed important.
Once again, the violence has jeopardised this process.
I regard Macedonia as our partner.
This right was suspended following the independence of Macedonia.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
United Nations World Day
on the health situation in the Republic of Uzbekistan.
on East Timor.
on the situation in Columbia.
United Nations World Day to overcome extreme poverty
This poverty has increased in the last six years.
Violations of human rights in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam
This Western head of government did not receive him.
His name was VÃ¡clav Havel.
It is a policy of autosuggestion.
Yet the reality sends out a very different message.
Persecution of human rights activists has increased.
Health situation in the Republic of Uzbekistan
Malnutrition and poverty have reached crisis point.
I commend this motion to the House.
Our task is not simply to deliver great sermons.
Please allow me to give a personal account today.
The situation there is disastrous.
We met the people there.
We met the relief workers.
The situation there is degrading.
The sewers in the basement are broken.
They are absolutely overflowing with human excrement.
There are mosquitoes flying around.
The stench there is unbearable.
They go home.
They infect members of their families.
They infect other people around them.
East Timor
The European Parliament must take pleasure in this result.
Today, however, is a joyous occasion.
We must continue to help East Timor.
Colombia
The violence also affects us closely.
A clean-up campaign was even announced in August.
This is a very high figure.
Our principal concern remains that of freedom of opinion.
Before that, he had been an active anti-Communist.
These activities are of a developmental nature.
Let me turn to East Timor.
This will hopefully stabilise the political landscape even further.
This process seems to be well on track.
East Timor is at an historical juncture.
The emergency phase is over.
This could change the picture dramatically.
I would say that so far, so good.
Finally, I turn to Colombia.
EUR 10 m are being spent this year.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Southern Caucasia
Political instability repeatedly threatens the still incomplete independence process.
Is it still meeting?
Even that is not clear.
Our commitments need to be followed by specific actions.
That would be unacceptable.
A Political Directors Troika visit followed in September.
In particular, the role of Russia is paramount.
Mr Dupuis mentioned the issue of our delegations.
This is an impossible job.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Political situation in Myanmar (Burma)
The general human rights situation in Burma is alarming.
Forced labour and torture are commonplace.
Mr President, the situation in Burma is disastrous.
The political system is corrupt and repressive.
Her house arrest continues to this day.
Or that they will genuinely allow refugees to return.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Patenting of human genes
We owe this to the women affected.
A discovery must not be recast as an invention.
That is only right and proper.
That is simply not possible!
And that is how it should be.
We have therefore not signed the common resolution.
We really believe that this is an abuse.
We shall not be able to support the resolution.
But Mr Nielson was otherwise distracted.
Thank you very much, Mr Purvis.
Mr President, the previous speaker made a comment.
I think that Mr Rothley attacked me personally.
It has a Board of Appeal.
That is a significant difference.
What Mr Rothley says is also incorrect.
The mind boggles.
So where does the problem actually lie?
Let me explain again.
I just wanted to clarify that point.
Number one.
Thank you very much, Mrs Breyer.
I fully endorse its position.
Mr President, this is a very serious matter.
I will put your objections to my colleagues.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
Community guarantee for EIB loans to former Yugoslavia
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Association of overseas countries and territories with the EC
Community solidarity cannot be two-speed.
That is not correct.
This is new and should be highlighted.
Transitional provisions have been proposed.
Again this is a matter for the Community.
We have to get out of the self-service syndrome.
Let me turn to trade.
We should not fool ourselves on this issue.
So let me be very clear here.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.

President.
The order of business is thus established.
Thank you, Mr Borghezio.
Please arrange for that report's immediate publication.
(Applause from the Greens/ALE Group)
This is completely unacceptable.
Thank you, Madam President.
Madam President, Africa also exists.
I am glad that is the final result.
I deeply regret that it took so long.
Thank you.
I shall gladly do so, Mr Onesta.
Mr Ibragimov has begun to eat again.
I shall now give the floor to Commissioner Vitorino.
Comparative assessments are carried out on other risks.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.
No doubt the United Kingdom does likewise in Sellafield.
We have to factor that into our calculations.
Please keep reporting to Parliament.
We cannot currently guarantee the safety of our citizens.
They are concerned and quite rightly so.
Has the Commission taken these disaster scenarios seriously?
How will it ensure the safety of our citizens?
In my view, these are wise comments.
Secondly, there is the issue of transponders.
Terrorists are now willing to engage in suicide missions.
In this climate this is simply not good enough.
We need to act as quickly as possible.
It would simply be wrong to assert anything else.
The same applies to the water supply.
It is relatively straightforward to poison water.
Studies are something we do not need.
Mr President, please allow me a final word.
We should not give the impression of total security.
I want clarity on this.
These include ground-to-air missiles.
It has undertaken an emergency risk assessment.
I expect it to be circulated.
This is very serious.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Briefly, about aviation.
This was the background to what I said.
I have taken careful note of your comments.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
European judicial area/SIS II
So I would prefer to speak on them separately.
Let me begin with the area of civil law.
Its entry into force brought about active European lawmaking.
I can only emphatically support that.
Technology has moved on in the meantime as well.
Such is quite evidently not the case here.
Less is sometimes more.
The second problem is the development of law.
So there is no disrespect for this House.
Thank you, Mr von Boetticher.
The rapporteur has produced two excellent reports.
It must be financed from our budget.
We must take account of this.
Mr President, I congratulate Mr von Boetticher.
Basic freedoms perform quite different functions in capitalism.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This gives me great pleasure.
Public participation in drawing up environmental plans and programmes
Our committee was extremely clear.
Anything else would be unthinkable in a democracy.
This legislation could prevent that kind of situation arising.
Secondly, the ratification of the Aarhus Convention.
(PPE-DE).
However, it is also a minimum obligation.
It is not correct.
There is no question of restricting those rights.
I regret this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)
II.
The Council adopted the same policy.
There are two reasons for this.
There are nonetheless certain unresolved issues.
The committee was kind enough to follow my recommendations.
The purpose of this is to avoid conciliation.
May we continue along that route!
Parliament wanted to send a message to the Commission.
We support the two amendments he has tabled.
The Commission must re-establish that balance.
We await concrete proposals from the Commissioner.
I believe it should be put through as is.
I commend the directive to the House.
Why?
That is an important fact to bear in mind.
Now I come to the amendments tabled.
It is also in contradiction with existing comitology rules.
Of that, Mr Goebbels is also aware.
Depositing is fundamental for the European system.
That is possible in the United States.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
International monetary system
The international financial institutions must become truly universal.
The monetary fund must become more democratic.
Europe must become more active in international bodies.
In fact it would have terrible economic consequences.
The Chilean encaja would achieve better results.
On that point we take a completely different view.
Functioning globalised financial markets are no doubt advantageous.
The report points that out.
I am particularly thinking of the Tobin tax.
I believe that this would supplement the report.
Because it cannot be regulated.
By that means, growth can be produced.
That has already been said.
Third, we begin at home.
The Stability and Growth Pact is a European response.
Remove this reinterpretation; in LiÃ¨ge we find ourselves.
What has been happening in recent years?
The Commission can only agree with this analysis.
So how do we respond?
What can we do?
How can we improve the situation?
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 8.47 p.m.)
(Applause)
I have taken note of what you have said.
Decision on urgent procedure
Lagendijk (Verts/ALE).
Two issues are involved.
There is a great deal of confusion about this.

Community incentive measures in the field of employment
Employment policy is to be evaluated in 2003.
On the contrary.
That is what we are voting on today.
However, I am also a little pessimistic.
I am delighted that the rapporteur drafted this report.
Maybe my pessimism could be transformed into optimism.
Those are Amendments Nos 1-8 and 14.
I should like to specify exactly what I accept.
Amendments Nos 1-3 I accept in full.
I hope that this approach will meet your concerns.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Informing and consulting employees
Transitional periods: this is an extremely sensitive point.
The question of penalties is the most sensitive point.
The European People's Party favours flexibility.
That is subsidiarity.
This means partnership.
There is no doubt that this is economically advantageous.
Parliament is not asking for points to be added.
I will briefly comment on those two points.
Precisely those provisions have an extremely preventative effect.
The second point concerns transitional periods.
Information and consultation are not a punishment for business.
Examples of these are:
This is my question.
The question is whether existing laws work well.
There is plenty of evidence that they do not.
The responsibilities work both ways.
There have been a number of compromise amendments.
Voluntary agreements are not enough.
We often hear about good examples of voluntary agreements.
It is also about dignity in the workplace.
This efficiency requires the involvement of employees, naturally.
To demand discretion is one thing.
So, what exactly is the problem?
My second point relates to sanctions.
(Applause from the Left)
This was timely and also necessary.
It is absolutely vital to tackle it this way.
Problems do not arise.
People with in-depth knowledge add to productivity.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Employment guidelines for 2002/Joint employment report 2001
and
But the points have been set.
How are we to balance the equation?
Equality is an investment.
Indeed, temporary employment can create new opportunities.
The funds are allocated to four pillars.
That is the first pillar.
A number of evaluations are now under way.
They are pursuing their own policy.
This was true prior to 11 September.
One in 12 EU citizens is unemployed today.
The collapse of Aer Lingus simply cannot be permitted.
The Commission must look at this sympathetically and favourably.
But how?
Two-thirds of all European workers are employed in them.
His famous steady hand is trembling.
I do not know whether that is possible.
Otherwise, the Commission will have to act.
However, it would be the best solution.
Finally, a view of the open coordination method.
I found that illusory from the very start.
There are, of course, some positive trends.
Modernisation really does have winners.
We see the promotion of the low-wage sector.
It is therefore possible to put forward common goals.
Media attention plays an essential role in this.
The second point is best practices.
The situation is different now, however.
Can we continue within the same framework?
Mr Schmid put this question very clearly.
The changes which we propose include three basic factors.
The first is the need for national targets.
The Member States need to set national employment targets.
This proposal is being prepared as we speak.
Your text contains proposals for changes to the guidelines.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 tomorrow.
Exposure of workers to risks arising from physical agents
I will go through a couple of them.
We have been waiting for many years.
Amendment No 2 is crucial.
There is no question of any tightening-up.
That is simply not the case, however.
That is something that science is agreed about.
Allow me to emphasise two things in this connection.
That, I think, is wrong.
Vibration has been a major problem in the past.
I hope the report will be supported today.
I am going to deal specifically with whole-body vibration.
There are also other angles to be considered.
Let me be clear.
This will do huge damage to European economies.
It will cost jobs.
Any possible benefits are far outweighed by the costs.
That is why we propose a step-by-step approach.
This is not a question of political disagreement.
I accept Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7.
These amendments clearly improve and clarify the text.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon today.
I cannot tell you the status of the letter.
Therefore a balance has to be struck.

2002 budget
A5-0330/2001 by Mr Costa Neves
A5-0329/2001 by Mrs Buitenweg
Section I - European Parliament
Section II - Council
Section IV - Court of Justice
Section V - Court of Auditors
Section VI - Economic and Social Committee
Section VII - Committee of the Regions
Section VIII (A) - European Ombudsman
A5-0342/2001 by Mr SeppÃ¤nen
Thank you, Mr Costa Neves.
Mrs Buitenweg has the floor.
I wonder about that.
A pertinent example of this is the Nice Summit.
Who will pay for this?
Look around you, as you already are doing.
The ECSC has not attracted payments for many years.
The Commission must adopt a position on this swiftly.
I will therefore not enter into any detail today.
The key word here is 'wine' .
That cannot be what you meant.
It has 189 established posts.
The temporary posts bring the total to 215.
Indeed, it is, of course, justified.
Together, we managed it.
That shows what current demands are.
The Commission has proposed EUR 35 million for it.
Parliament proposed its reduction by EUR 14 million.
That fisheries agreement has now finally collapsed.
A large amount will become available.
I know we are going to need this money.
Why do I urge this?
.
We have also looked at tabling amendments.
We are creating another 99 posts this year alone.
The consequences of this development are clear to see.
We must make changes here.
Let me single out three issues.
This applies equally to my second point on Save.
These are key to promoting a safer world.
The under-utilisation of Parliament's buildings, for instance.
We know something must be done.
That is needed.
We must, though, face reality.
This is not on!
It is absolutely not on!
Take your courage in both hands!
The Committee on Fisheries endorses this view.
Chapter A-30 again caused problems.
All these subjects are extremely topical.
Parliaments, you know, have various responsibilities.
I congratulate the rapporteurs.
Their work is never easy.
That is not a reference to you President-in-Office!
One has to hope that can be changed rapidly.
Where are we?
It is stuck in the Council.
The Commission will take the decisions instead of Parliament.
I hope you will take that on board.
My group supports this goal.
Heading 4 is difficult.
It must be dissolved.
This could be partly acceptable.
Parliament is now reinstating these figures.
This undermines trust in the institutions of the EU.
Examples of them might be employment or healthy food.
We must have a policy against unemployment.
There is more.
There are papers to this effect in the Council.
The same goes for Europol and Eurojust.
We will accord them high honour for it.
We will introduce innovation.
We must not stand on old rights.
There is room for progress here.
Thank you very much for your attention.
(Applause)
I will start with the first heading.
We can look into insurance systems.
The SAPARD payment periods must be extended to 2003.
What are they about?
I would be much obliged.
We shall see in December what happens.
The first comment concerns the RAL.
My second comment concerns the reform of the Commission.
I strongly deny what James Elles said.
The cooperation has been really good.
Secondly, we must speed up internal reform.
This does not hold water.
We want to rescue aid to the Balkans.
Let us get around the negotiating table.
Pricing is becoming chaotic and nobody can explain why.
Go on, blame the citizens!
Such is inflation!
We must have discussions with the Commission about this.
Let me now address one further point.
We made 400 posts available in the 2001 Budget.
The European Union is already expensive for taxpayers.
We have Kosovo: we have to help Kosovo.
We have Serbia: we have to help Serbia.
We have Afghanistan: we have to help Afghanistan.
And the next headline will become the priority.
And what price do we pay?
We still have problems in the Balkans.
We still have a serious problem in Africa.
But we have to make cuts.
Why?
Why is that not budgeted for?
It should have done so.
We only made legitimate requests.
Thank you very much, Mr Deprez.
Nothing will stop when we reach 2004.
Everything must continue.
Specific aid measures are therefore needed.
That seems extremely important to me.
It can be done another way.
But we must always hope.
This is quite unjustifiable and so seems positively wilful.
The Commission's action in this regard is anti-social.
They simply exist.
That seems to be all that matters.
In Slovakia, the inevitable conclusions were reached.
I would ask her to look at them.
I thank the Commissioner for her consideration.
This decision is fair, technically correct and necessary.
Let me first return to the flexibility reserve.
He had asked me to wait for it.
Things like that do not happen all the time.
Many thanks!
The joint debate is closed.
EIB: Community guarantee against lending losses
.
The proposal has the broadest possible political support.
This year the ceiling is 208 million euros.
The Commission must take action accordingly.
Such conditions affect us all.
We have had to postpone other promised projects.
We have set a ceiling of EUR 100 million.
Thank you very much, Mr Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
EBRD: Community contribution to Chernobyl Shelter Fund
The current financial situation is as follows.
No national budget can cope with such a calamity.
We will keep Parliament informed.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for your contribution, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
ESF (2000 - 2006)
rapporteur.
The social partners have an important role to play.
Thank you very much.
Can the Commissioner indicate the reason for these measures?
I share the critical tone of the report.
This was announced in February 2001.
The first call was a complete success.
Naturally we hope Parliament will also attend.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Equal treatment for men and women in employment
It needs to be clear and legally tenable.
Then I would like to mention equal pay.
That is mistaken for a number of reasons.
However, that does not apply to legislative texts.
It contains a number of major failings.
Moreover, the penalty is extremely lenient.
What will happen if we are?
She has made accusations against us.
Perhaps they should read the documents!
You spoke for more than two minutes.
That is our first achievement.
Nevertheless, we are now going a step further.
But that is what we expect.
We want to create a clear legal framework.
That is unfortunately not the case.
I emphasise his or her own work.
Thank you.
For our big problem is not the legislator.
The mind boggles.
We have the result before us.
Bureaucracy alone will not promote equal treatment.
That is why I am pleased with this report.
The compromise therefore is extremely delicate.
Here there is the need for flexibility.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
6th, 7th and 8th EDF discharge for 1999
I can recommend discharge today without any reservations.
It is implementation that is at stake here.
That is the problem in a nutshell.
It will be a pivotal factor.
That is why we urgently need this joint reform.
Thank you very much.
The loss was estimated at around EUR 27.4 million.
We are very happy to vote for it.
We grilled them.
We need to continue to do this.
It has to be tackled with realism.
An isolated approach by the Commission would be unrealistic.
It must rely on the development of internal accountability.
This is serious.
This should not be forgotten.
I want to make that perfectly clear.
We cannot act alone.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Classification of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)
We are dealing with European territorial construction.
I am sure that cannot be right.
I voted against certain amendments in committee.
What is our intention?
Our document is essentially based on three principles.
This objective is essential at this time.
Modifications are inevitable.
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.09 p.m.)
Thank you for your comments.
I have nothing against the Scottish Police.
They were extremely courteous.
They were aware of the concept of peaceful demonstration.
What is the situation regarding our immunity?
We shall thoroughly examine the issue regarding protocol.
You are on your own.
Thank you, Mr Santini.
European Council meeting (Ghent, 19 October 2001)
That was, of course, to be expected.
A new, global order is upon us.
I believe that we have agreed on this approach.
The streets were calm.
However, that must be our objective.
This is a completely new development.
Partnerships that will ensure lasting stability in our continent.
Firstly, the fundamental aspects of our economy.
Secondly, our programme.
Thirdly, our instruments.
(Loud applause)
We have to make Europe's voice heard more.
(Applause)
We now have a coalition against terrorism.
Our group supports it unreservedly.
Afghanistan has been suffering for twenty years.
(Applause)
We see the Mediterranean dialogue as an important challenge.
There may of course also be a minority vote.
This must not lead to negotiations without binding effect.
(Applause)
The prior meeting of certain Member States was inappropriate.
It may help you to present interesting proposals.
The Union needs economic leadership.
I am pleased that you were in Poland yesterday.
I appreciate the enormous difficulties.
That had no precedent ever in European law making.
But I have an important question around it.
I very much welcome that.
Does that invitation extend to Turkey?
Will Turkey be a participant in the process?
In what ways did the Fifteen analyse these events?
What is our objective?
We must all be on the watch for that.
We want to ensure that this is done.
Have nothing to do with this, Prime Minister!
Invite elected representatives to the next summit in Laeken.
Be careful: fundamental rights and freedoms are involved!
Strictly speaking, Ghent has thus fulfilled the expectations.
This applies first and foremost to the CFSP.
No, Europe is not absent!
In fact, Ghent was a ghost town.
We are facing an economic crisis.
We cannot afford failure at Laeken.
As if it legitimised anything!
I would thank the architects of the summit.
It has been an eye-opener.
This distinction is essential.
That is not at issue at all.
We are all justified in asking for immediate withdrawal.
We have money.
We have trade.
We have the UN.
We have resources in that region.
We can be of real significance there.
That is my first plea.
My second plea concerns Afghanistan.
The EU has no military presence in Afghanistan.
History has taught us that.
However, we must take that political direction.
It is the only way to catch Bin Laden.
You did not get sidetracked in Ghent.
It has not always been like that.
This would represent an enduring victory for terrorism.
Let me raise another point.
Neither are we talking about establishing emergency laws.
Not everywhere is there evidence of one.
I should like to make three observations.
I welcome this.
And then the EU President asked for an evaluation.
What is the European Union' s role?
Is a single foreign and security policy possible?
Nor should the British allow themselves to be deceived.
We need capacity to act as a Community.
So we need the European Rapid Reaction Force.
A joint vision and a joint approach.
Again, we have a joint stance.
Now this no longer holds true.
Possibly the third week of November.
But when will this come about?
It is obvious.
That was not the conclusion reached in Tampere.
The convention is a fact.
Indeed, it is related to that text.
The answer is very simple.
(Applause)
A further point related to the Convention.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Thank you, President Prodi.
I apologise for this.
The debate is closed.
Thank you for your comment.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
We will certainly take note of this.

Council reform
This own-initiative report does not concern the Council alone.
The Council has already lost much of its effectiveness.
No one dares to make a decision anymore.
I shall mention just a few.
Thank you.
This report, though, sets alarm bells ringing.
Things must change!
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
We must consolidate this.
I hope she can cooperate with us.
That would also help the reform.
Transparency is one such issue.
That is not acceptable.
Everyone talks about this, and everyone criticises it.
The legislation must be a matter for public debate.
The Union must assume a new role.
The Council has to understand this.
The Belgian Presidency-in-Office shakes her head in disbelief.
Madame, I know, I was there!
Fifteen per cent of them they deal with themselves.
However, that is the exception.
And quite rightly so.
However, it is not enough.
The second paragraph is Paragraph 19.
The Legislative Council urgently needs this public character.
Changes must be made here.
What is that?
Belgium set a good example in this connection.
It is about time!
Once again, this is just to remind you.
Thank you very much, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
All this slows down the process.
I would like to briefly explain this.
We still need to draw operational consequences from this.
Only then will reform be truly possible.
Who stands to suffer most from these attacks?
The world' s poorest of the poor.
That is a disaster.
Why?
We support a new trade round.
Multilateralism must be neither asymmetrical nor imperialist.
Doha will not be Seattle, however.
It will be something vague between the two.
The social issue is symbolic.
I would stress that Doha has a specific mission.
Things are looking quite bad.
It is right to take small steps.
However, far more ambitious steps must follow.
Open trade - yes, but only with rules.
Secondly, environmental standards.
The EU faces charges of protectionism.
This is a deal-breaker for us.
I know you will be tough on our behalf.
Good luck Commissioner.
His task will certainly be a difficult one.
It will not be an easy task.
However, everything bodes well.
Regrettably the Council has not taken the same step.
I hope that we will make progress there.
We have always had this support from the Commission.
Thank you once again for cooperating with us.
I welcome this development with open arms.
It is significant in itself.
There will indeed be some of that.
This is how our democracy works.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
International trade
Many developing countries lack the necessary competences.
Today the figure stands at only 0.4%.
We propose going further, however.
The Dispute Settlement Body needs to be thoroughly overhauled.
Accountability and transparency are therefore exceptionally important.
Less injustice will increase the safety of us all.
It is a tool for dismantling democracy.
I disagree with the content of this criticism.
There must be more room for trade compensation.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)
I hope we will seize it.
We should be under no illusion about this.
We need to work towards both objectives.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
We need to try to change that emphasis.
We need strategic lift.
Our mediation efforts were dogged by bad luck.
They will put it to the test.
Horizontal issues must now be thrown into the spotlight.
Take countries such as Ukraine.
There is more cause for this than ever before.
My first point concerns conflict prevention.
Let us give these people something to work on.
What should this policy be?
Who could sleep peacefully with bombs under the bed?
I am not going to comment on this point.
We can probably do better in the future.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
Turkey
Because there are also delays and even retreats.
Our judgment will be based on the facts.
This is a perfectly legitimate objective.
The European Union does not impose one single model.
But there are two needs which we all acknowledge.
For me this is a test case.
It is a very good report.
Some people think that it is too soft.
We definitely wish to take note of them.
The final problem is Cyprus.
Turkey simply has not realised this.
That will be very interesting.
It is not late.
It is the morning for you.
So there is no problem.
I do not think that that helps it.
I think we should be clear, however.
I have to say that he is very diplomatic.
There is a single exception.
You have decided to urge her to join us.
But I will add something else.
Official Turkish sources produce very different noises.
Quite the reverse, in fact.
My second comment concerns Cyprus.
It is not only women to whom this happens.
It is time to launch peace negotiations.
Is this a genuine reform?
I would answer, no.
The time is right for sweeping reforms.
That is its basic message.
Mr President, the report acknowledges certain obvious truths.
That is a fact.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It spared me somewhat.
I want to see a pluralistic Europe.
This would facilitate greater understanding and mutual respect.
The Turks have made advances.
Yes, the Kurdish people.
This is the case with the Kurds.
But, to come back to the death penalty.
We obviously feel that it must be abolished completely.
There can only be complete abolition.
For me, this constitutional reform represents real progress.
Our relations have progressed well since Helsinki.
The pre-accession strategy has been implemented.
Turkey has promised to support this process.
The window of opportunity is open.
Relations between Greece and Turkey have already improved considerably.
The Commission welcomes the confidence-building measures agreed.
The proposed amendments are acceptable to us.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Loading and unloading of bulk carriers
The European Commission would like to change this.
The most important amendments related to two topics:
That leaves three that were not adopted.
Increasing marine safety requires ongoing work.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Reporting formalities for ships
This time we neatly avoided this pitfall.
Europe needs constructive action and less politically-motivated confrontation.
Ladies and gentlemen, the rudder is set.
I give credit for this U-turn to him.
It does not impose new obligations on shipowners.
Thank you, once again, to Mr Vatanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Accession to the WTO
China must adapt.
The EU does not need to do very much.
Certain China-specific quantitative restrictions are to be phased out.
However, these are of relatively little importance.
I have a number of doubts on that score.
Criticisms are being made in China.
You only have to log on to the Internet.
China received certain concessions.
China has nine hundred million people employed within agriculture.
What conclusions do I draw, then?
But how shall we achieve this?
We shall achieve it through integration.
Here, too, the watchword is integration.
This last objective is now within reach.
And that is another reason to stand together.
For the first time, Parliament has been consulted.
It is, therefore, literally an explosion.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
Address by His Holiness the XIVth Dalai-Lama
(Loud applause)
So I will speak Tibetan.
(Laughter and applause)
I thank you for this kind invitation.
I am not an expert in political science.
The world is becoming increasingly interdependent.
We see this tragic situation repeated time and again.
Others are advocating a referendum in Tibet.
It is my duty to speak on their behalf.
Let us remember that when we vote.
Of course, Mr Santini.

COM in sheepmeat and goatmeat
A number of proposals have been put forward.
We were broadly supportive.
We proposed an amendment in relation to individual tagging.
There is money there.
There will not be another bite at this cherry.
Mr President, I apologise for my absence.
Despair is gaining ground.
Nevertheless, it contains various loopholes and shortcomings.
We see a crippled industry.
That adds to the existing desperation in the countryside.
A distinction between the two cannot really be justified.
Such a policy would be ill-advised.
It is perhaps long overdue, but certainly welcome.
Our producers have been very lucky.
I ask this House for its support.
That has a number of important advantages.
This new aid is stable.
It can also be calculated in advance.
This means that farmers can also plan with certainty.
Let me turn briefly to the most important amendments.
But they must be simple solutions.
I cannot therefore agree to those amendments.
Traceability is another important aspect.
This question will be settled in the implementing provisions.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.

On the contrary, they are beneficial to all.

Of course!
Regarding Wednesday President.
I shall explain why.
Why did we do this?
I think that we must respect Members.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Justice and Home Affairs.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Regarding Thursday
President.
Of course.
Speeches on points of order
They can be applied a little more subtly.
I hope we can do that.
We shall look into this matter very carefully.
It took me 23 hours to get home.
To date, I have received no such response.
None of these requests has obtained any response whatsoever.
We may as well be talking to Siberia.
Madam President, I expected something more!
Madam President, on a point of order.
Public access to Parliament documents
.
The whole point of political presence is political accountability.
I would also like to congratulate Mr Cashman.
Mr President, what is transparency?
Transparency is definitely one of them.
It represents an improvement.
I hope that will be accepted.
Mr Cashman has challenged the validity of this.
Parliaments must be transparent.
The media need to help in this as well.
The problem is everything that is not included.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Membership of interparliamentary delegations and joint parliamentary committees
The reasons for this escape me.
I have the report right here.
The second issue is efficiency.
There are arguments in favour of either solution.
The vote tomorrow will determine which way we go.
It should have been settled a long time ago.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his patience.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Europol - joint investigation teams
and
Judicial control has also been denied.
rapporteur.
Terrorism is uppermost in our minds at present.
There is one further point.
This is an orchestrated attack on grass-roots movements.
Is that so?
Are you from the Council?
We don' t know!
Thank you, Mr Cappato.
Europol is not operational.
We do not think this proposal is suitable.
They are also aware of this need.
We believe that this is a very positive approach.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
So far, so good.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Never mind.
Second attempt: privacy in the electronic communications sector.
I realise this.
I will therefore be speaking only about that.
But that was voted on at the last session.
Why?
It is not true.
Mrs Paciotti, you will continue to get spam!
I support the opt-out on two grounds.
It is going to put them at a disadvantage.
They will not opt out even if they could.
However, that would produce an incoherent European policy.
Despite this, they are saddled with most problems.
It is wrong and ill-informed.
Please support the Cappato report, as amended.
This compromise has all the hallmarks of a compromise.
That is where the spam is coming from.
We have not hurried this decision.
That is completely illogical.
We should be thinking about the future.
Technology is changing rapidly.
I fully agree.
Unfortunately that is no longer true.
That is a technological fact.
We should look at the future challenges.
Nevertheless, the operator is facing a serious problem.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
European films
That is an all-time low.
That is certainly far too low.
That is why European cinema requires no subsidies.
We must try to buck this trend.
European films are not being developed sufficiently.
We lack the resources to do this.
This is virgin territory at the moment.
It is unfortunate that many films are lost.
The memory of European cinema is being lost.
That, then, is possible.
There is a lot more that I could say.
Again, congratulations!
It is therefore essential and necessary to circulate films.
That is all very well, it sounds good.
That is wonderful.
And this is precisely one of the problematic areas.
More subsidies cannot be the solution on their own.
It is at this hurdle that we fall.
There are no independent producers.
These are just some observations.
That is why this is so urgent.
The problems are related.
There is a need for more than just organisation.
What Mrs Sanders-ten Holte said just now is important.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Protection of animals during transport
First of all, there is supervision.
My group supports this report.
This is long overdue.
They must be taken to court and fined.
Even Jewish ritual slaughter is brought into the argument.
It would be better to transport the meat afterwards.
There is no good reason for doing this.
This can and should be avoided.
Presumably, it is economic madness.
That is absurd!
We must police and enforce this fully.
Hard cases make bad law.
Animal welfare forms part of a greater whole.
That is, however, not the case.
Mr Maat, many thanks for the sound report.
This is not the kind of Europe we want!
I fully agree.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 9.40 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
Mr President, I wish to support Mr Wynn.
What are we going to do then?
The way this has been rushed through is unacceptable.
Mr President, the situation is well known.
We are talking about paying scrapping premiums.
We are talking about social measures.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
We nevertheless need a little more time.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure) President.
That concludes the vote.
The Court continues to work closely with OLAF.
The results are striking.
Let me finally add one little word.
But we also have another role in common.
That is always to defend the idea of Europe.
(Applause)
One example is in the personnel field.
For that you have my most especial thanks.
chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
So once again, many thanks.
I only want to highlight a couple of points.
This House had actually pressed for that.
Let us be clear.
Mr Karlsson, I noted your words last night.
The reform programme is heading in the right direction.
Perhaps Mrs Schreyer could comment on that.
The primary responsibility must lie with the Member States.
They are responsible for 85% of the budget.
Here we see some serious structural weaknesses.
Heads of stock continue be overstated.
It is on the right track.
I have started to wade through this tome.
The VAT carrousels are a prime example of this.
That has not been done to date.
I shall give four examples.
I have one comment to make on the DAS.
The Court of Auditors is reassessing this issue.
Parliament must monitor and support this.
Can we draw clear conclusions from it?
No, not really.
We can already detect some improvement.
However, this is still not enough.
It is the same old story every single year.
It cannot be said often enough.
Thank you for your fruitful cooperation over seven years.
My third point is a comment about OLAF.
That was a real compliment.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Thank you, Mr. Blak.
I wish you every success in that.
That concludes this item.
Money laundering
This led to major differences in transposal in Europe.
Mr President, I represent a minority.
That is going too far.
That is why I am voting against this.
It would destroy the integrity of advice.
He would therefore also have to denounce himself.
That is totally unheard of anywhere in the world.
I certainly cannot vote for that.
You will be stopped there.
This could not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.
We seem to have a similar phenomenon again here.
This is the only feasible interpretation.
Parliament has not exactly covered itself with glory.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Approximation of civil and commercial law
What is it about?
There are two key factors which explain this.
The Tampere conclusions foresaw convergence in civil law.
It is not about imposing a European civil code.
We should welcome that opportunity.
The difficulty relates to subsidiarity.
That is one point.
My final point concerns national regulations.
That will be very difficult.
What is that?
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Arbitrary arrests and the political situation in Laos
We are particularly happy to see Mr Dupuis back.
Those arrested have now been released again.
This action was ultimately successful.
This is extremely serious.
Thank you very much, Mr Fava.
The debate is closed.
Services of general interest in Europe
Why are we concerned with this area?
The Commission has comprehensively described the Community law framework.
What general interest services come under EU law?
What does this cover?
The dual broadcasting system has proved itself.
A balanced programme needs leeway.
Citizens must be regarded as consumers rather than objects.
In addition, high quality must be delivered.
What is at stake is of crucial importance.
Yes, I believe that we need safeguards.
Let me mention only ambulance services.
The second is the issue of checking for misuse.
We reject this decisively.
What falls at this arbitrary threshold?
When is intra-Community trade affected?
(The President cut the speaker off)
And there can be no other approach.
(The President cut the speaker off)
State monopolies must not be replaced by private monopolies.
Another major issue concerns evaluation.
Thank you Commissioner Bolkestein.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote

Thank you Mr Caveri.

(Parliament adopted the decision)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
The rest is therefore omitted.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Thank you for your suggestions, Mrs Auroi.
I am sure our services will welcome them.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I therefore want to reiterate this.
Mr President, you can ask your two comrades-in-arms.
I cannot do anything about it either.
Lehne report (A5-0380/2001)
This is all legal however.
The Lehne report does the opposite, however.
Maij-Weggen report (A5-0349/2001)
'What documents?'
I asked her.
'Next time round' I told her.
The problem is everything that is not included.

The Commission is giving itself the role of arbitrator.
We reject the Langen report for this specific reason.

33).
.
Passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway
This would merely be protectionism by the back door.
We came to a consensus.
We wanted controlled competition without privatisation.
The two are always confused with one another.
Privatisation is not automatically connected with it.
Competition is also really needed in this industry.
Of course contracts must be put out to tender.
That is democracy; that is the subsidiarity principle.
The citizen will see through this.
That is our common objective.
What, then, is the position?
That is the objective we have set.
That is what we are doing.
I have several reasons for this view.
Secondly, this goes against the principle of subsidiarity.
I do not think anyone can deny this.
This is not a problem that exists in reality.
Finally, I will say something about subsidiarity.
Quite the reverse, in fact.
Nevertheless, this liberalisation process should not be forced.
It must be carried out in stages.
Many thanks, Mr President.
For us, it is about safety.
However, let us take this first step together.
The draft report raises legal problems in certain cases.
We cannot therefore accept this amendment either.
The second legal problem relates to reciprocity.
The initiative states that.
We are talking about significant transport markets.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Market access to port services
Granted, that is not exactly easy.
Pilot services are another issue.
I extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur.
For the rest, I back the Commission proposal.
We must increase competition at ports.
Why?
The same happens in the Mediterranean in the south.
So that is the first problem.
I shall confine myself to the key points.
Thank you.
I would like to make several points:
Competition is one thing.
Destruction of a successful industry is quite another.
The whole package is unbalanced and unworkable.
I hope the House rejects it tomorrow.
Quite a few speakers have referred to pilotage.
I am in favour of self-financed ports.
I will not support these amendments.
Ports and their users deserve solid, well-thought-out legislation.
These professions are fairly similar.
They do not have the same nautical qualities.
This is why Amendment 52 is dangerous.
I am sorry but this is an absurd idea.
We cannot change Europe into a giant Hamburg.
'Eurosclerosis' hits the poor hardest.
Let us pilot Europe towards competitive ports.
It deals with aspects relating to competition between ports.
Our proposal guarantees a fair balance between these needs.
This is not always the case at the moment.
The latter is already included in the legislation.
It is not possible.
Another problem is the issue of pilotage.
Enlargement
The next item is the Commission communication on enlargement.
It is also Europe' s historic duty.
(Loud applause)
Why is this so?
We are therefore also making extensive additional resources available.
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
Now for my questions.
I then have a very specific question.
Can you say something more about that?
We abide fully by what we agreed.
I think that is the cause of this confusion.
Perhaps you could define that a bit more exactly.
Our response is quite clear.
I am obliged to the honourable Member.
This monitoring is going on constantly.
There are positive things in it.
There has been no progress in the economic sphere.
So much is well known.
That is the good I have to report.
We have already discussed this in another context.
Madam President, I have three questions.
My second question concerns the action plan and finance.
The burden is not therefore borne by other projects.
They touch on nothing else.
Let me say it clearly: none of them.
What does the Commission intend to do about this?
That concludes this item of the agenda.
Madam President, on a point of order.
This is not in the interests of Parliament.
Should I have cut them off because of that?
I have tried to act for the best.
If I was wrong, I apologise.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I will submit my questions to him in writing.
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
Question No 28 by (H-0857/01):
Question No 29 by (H-0849/01):
These measures are intended to deal with this point.
Commissioner, I find that answer extraordinarily complacent.
I am sure we all sympathise with the families.
This is a very serious matter.
Have you looked at that study?
Clearly, that may be inappropriate.
But can you not do something?
Do you believe in upholding them?
We had said goodbye to the Vice-President for today.
Thank you for your attention.
Question No 30 by (H-0839/01):
Part II
According to information, further studies are nearing completion.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
I understand the concerns of the honourable Member.
I also have three children.
The Scientific Committee is also concerned.
Questions to Commissioner Reding
Question No 31 by (H-0772/01):
No.
Can we make just any old film for children?
Question No 32 by (H-0776/01):
We have accepted this division.
We are running a little late.
I would like you to bear this in mind.
Mrs Malliori has the floor for a supplementary question.
Another point is research.
Question No 33 by (H-0805/01):
Some of these projects involved Greek and Latin.
Thank you very much, Mrs Reding.
Questions to Mr Liikanen
Question No 34 by (H-0786/01):
Question No 35 by (H-0790/01):
Question No 36 by (H-0801/01).
That is why I tabled the question.
I will make two comments.
It is our responsibility to monitor it properly.
The third part of my question is slightly broader.
Question No 37 by (H-0800/01):
Several Member States have reacted to the Danish proposal.
Question No 38 by (H-0821/01):
Is this view correct?
We have already produced a proposal.
Thank you for all your replies, Mr Liikanen.
Questions to Mr Vitorino
Question No 41 by (H-0782/01):
Question No 42 by (H-0792/01):
That was my question.
Question No 43 by (H-0794/01):
Thank you very much for your reply, Commissioner.
It shows that the Commission has understood the problem.
I am very happy to reply.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Security of energy supply
There are three main points in the Green Paper.
However let us be realistic,.
It seems obvious but needs repeating.
Thank you again.
I believe that BNFL is technically insolvent.
The reasons are well known.
Nor does nuclear fusion offer a solution.
This realisation is what underlies the Green Paper.
There are other areas as well.
Mr Chichester mentioned coal.
We must promote clean technologies in coal.
The debate on the Green Paper is still open.
It is therefore premature to anticipate its final conclusions.
Somebody said earlier that we have done little.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Mr Turmes, on a point of order.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Chemicals strategy
First, the practicability of the registration system.
Secondly, a clear definition of the substitution principle.
Thirdly, appropriate protection for test data.
Mrs SchÃ¶rling's report is to that extent unbalanced.
Amounts are merely auxiliary quantities.
What is crucial is the amount of risk involved.
It is long overdue.
Socio-economic issues will be particularly important.
But that was a few months ago.
All these concerns need to be taken into account.
This is only a White Paper.
First of all, the industry' s responsibility.
That is why a change is needed.
Secondly, the reach system should be modified.
The one we have at present is unsatisfactory.
This cannot be a modern environmental policy.
But perhaps someone will be able to tell them.
I cannot understand it.
Even they should be registered.
That is not, however, going to happen.
This constitutes a reversal of the burden of proof.
However they can also be bad for you.
Sometimes they need to be phased out or banned.
A massive cost to animals has been referred to.
They could be at risk.
We should prioritise areas for action.
I should like to mention a few essential points.
It must be verifiable.
So we will have to look into that.
How does one ascertain something like that?
Who ascertains something like that?
The background is as follows.
However, we must balance these requirements.
Chemicals have many extremely important advantages for society.
Between three and four million jobs depend upon it.
These chemicals are the first things a child ingests.
That is a fact.
That obviously has to change.
That is a basic error in the system.
There is no doubt a misunderstanding here.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources
I found the Commission document very good.
Mr President, water is the Number One food.
Incentives are necessary for water to be continuously used.
My group is happy to support it.
That is why hotels and farmers use it sparingly.
This is standard practice in northern Europe.
And we will be voting against these amendments.
A community pricing system would create many problems.
Legislating now would be a mistake.
Affordable prices are often saddled with negative associations.
It will be difficult to keep to the timetable.
These working parties are to develop implementation guidelines.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Packaging and packaging waste
We must make sustainable development viable.
Fortunately, we are not starting from scratch.
Thirdly, reliable and comparable data is lacking.
Special attention must be given to plastic.
That is connected with transport distances and the materials.
I welcome these suggestions with open arms.
We really need to discuss packaging.
It is possible.
That would be a merciful answer to our prayers.
That is where the problem really lies.
Is there not a multitude of loopholes?
As you mentioned, databases are largely lacking.
I do not believe so.
Let me make clear that I regret that.
Mrs Corbey is quite right to name names.
That did not happen.
The answer is probably a combination of the two.
The first revolves around an Integrated Product Policy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Insurance mediation
The scope of the directive is well balanced.
It is an increasingly important way of distributing insurance.
They are therefore rejected.
Thirdly there are amendments referring to information requirements.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Tonight we have missed it by only ten seconds.
(The sitting was closed at midnight.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
I was here, and I spoke immediately afterwards.
We will make sure your vote is recorded.
There is no doubt about that.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
European Research Area (Multiannual Framework Programme 2002-2006)
As you know, this is an important programme.
You will express your view when we vote.
All this translates into two new, secondary priorities.
Firstly, there is the fight against major diseases.
We might or we might not.
We therefore call for them to be studied.
The Caudron report quite rightly addresses these aspects.
It might have required specific research.
I think the first title was better.
I would like to finish on this point.
The latter became the stairway of excellence.
I note that there have been adjustments here too.
The highest levels were in Finland with 36%.
We worked well together.
Agriculture is also more involved.
We have slightly shifted the priorities.
That is why I believe our amendments are excellent.
It will be available in any case.
Let us build on their past success.
We have worked very well together.
My thanks also go to my fellow shadow rapporteurs.
We have a lot to do.
Firstly, the ethical questions.
That is very long term.
That is something which I think invites reflection.
Social research does not belong in that context.
I do not properly understand how this has happened.
In this matter it is particularly well-founded.
It will also use scientific resources.
Intervening in life created by God is non-negotiable.
That must be the basic principle.
That could also lead to a brain drain.
They aim to prevent this.
Has the Commission looked into this?
Two points cause me concern.
Safety issues play only a subordinate role.
The same applies to preparation funds.
Why should a good arrangement be abolished?
Amendment No 265 concerns this matter.
It is not their priority.
This is unacceptable to mainstream science.
This again is completely unacceptable to our citizens.
A second important point is orientation.
Research ought to be aimed at development.
Enterprises play an important role in disseminating scientific innovation.
I commend it to the Parliament.
My third observation is on fusion.
We should, however, give them the option.
Researchers and scientists are working away in laboratories.
I have in mind stem cell research in particular.
Sooner or later it will overcome.
We have facilities.
We have knowledge that can be made use of.
The proposal even offers support to germline therapy.
I would like to raise two issues.
Paper does not blush, however.
How will we achieve these goals?
We urgently need the specific programmes.
That is the first point.
We will also carry out an ex post audit.
Thank you very much.
I look forward to further years of cooperation.
Mr President, I am in favour of research.
I urge that we do not desert this principle.
It is cannibalism.
Europe is still a collection of individual initiatives.
Cultural heritage belongs to the world of non-renewable resources.
They were also involved in the work.
That equates to three-quarters.
It is important to be aware of that.
That question had indeed already been dealt with.
That was in fact what Mrs McNally proposed.
Such an initiative would bear considerable fruit too.
Why not risk depriving these activities of resources?
Adequate funding must be made available.
This is indeed a sensitive issue.
I trust I am not trying your patience.
I should like to make two last points.
I shall now refer to management.
The Court of Auditors is one of these critics.
We shall therefore prepare the proposal.
We have taken the initiative with the new instruments.
That is our next task.
In conclusion, I should like to thank Parliament.
I believe an important task has been concluded.
Thank you for your work and for your contribution.
(Applause)
Thank you for your speech, Commissioner Busquin.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
EU/Latin America relations
Commissioner.
I shall certainly do my best.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkenstein.
I am, naturally, referring to Cuba.
This applies especially to the Puebla Panama project.
In particular I want to state two points.
Welcome
These meetings began in 1996.
EU/Latin America relations (continuation)
Thank you, Mr Salafranca.
Shipbuilding
I think we have put forward a sound proposal.
South Korea did not honour it.
South Korea did not respond.
This is the issue today.
South Korea has the solution in its hand.
None of us wants long-term subsidies.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
The next item is the vote.
Procedure without debate:
(The President declared the common position approved)
After the vote on Amendment No 130: President.
(Laughter and applause)
We aim to please.
Before the vote on the draft legislative resolution:
I am therefore in favour of continuing the process.
(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
(Loud applause)
Before the vote on Amendment No 47:
I assume that Amendment No 47 now lapses.
(Laughter and applause)
Amendment No 47 falls.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Before the vote:
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
(Sustained applause)
Before the vote:
Before the vote on Amendments Nos 322 and 333:
It refers to the same paragraph.
I am sorry.
I cannot agree because we are voting on additions.
Thank you for that clarification.
Do you agree, Mr Caudron?
He is right about that minor addition.
Thank you.
Mr Caudron, Mrs McNally is reading your mind.
I certainly wished to comment.
That is outdated wording.
I am indeed sorry.
Mr Caudron, you are possibly confusing two parts.
No, Mr President, I am not mistaken.
I am not referring to Paragraph 4.
At least I am clear now.
Mr President, this amendment is about technology assessment.
That is very clear.
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
Alright, 'new or improved' .
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
Report Meijer (A5-0364/2001):
.
.
Quite the opposite.
Report Jarzembowski (A5-0354/2001):
This endeavour is more than infuriating or provocative.
That is why we voted against the Jarzembowski report.

I have several reasons for voting against this report.

), in writing.
.
These are port services of general interest.
Report Berenguer Fuster (A5-0359/2001):
Naturally it means social security and sickness benefit.
Report Caudron (A5-0376/2001):
.
.
.
We are forced to prioritise.
Our voting behaviour has proved that this is nonsense.
We have therefore abstained from the final vote.
Report Caudron (A5-0355/2001):
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Hence the confusion.
International situation
Recently, it visited countries in Central Asia.
The presidency has taken various steps to that end.
Obviously we cannot discuss the latest developments.
Every hour brings its fresh share of dramatic news.
The military strategy against the Taliban has proved successful.
It illustrates the very nature of the Union.
This is the task now being undertaken in Afghanistan.
We must give Afghanistan our help.
I must say that I found this embarrassing.
We call on you to take this action.
That is my first point.
Police cooperation is improving.
We must continue in that vein.
That must be our response.
We need to reiterate that debt of gratitude.
But it is there.
So there is a great need for urgency.
I have two final comments.
One concerns the Middle East.
If so, what are they?
But what justice are we talking about?
What balance are we talking about?
No, enough of that!
Things are not like that.
Yes, the situation remains politically fragile.
Harbouring terrorists is a crime in itself.
We must reaffirm this message at every opportunity.
That is a total package.
The position of Syria has already been mentioned.
I know that Europe has two obligations towards Afghanistan.
We are making sure that we take action here.
Therefore I cannot give it.
We need to act as a community.
I can only confirm it.
Thank you, Mr Busquin.
The debate is closed.
The Council is, therefore, maintaining its position.
Russia used to implement extensive programmes.
The costs involved in those initiatives are enormous.
My third question is addressed to the Council.
I hope it is a hypothetical question.
Has the Council considered this?
We have not succeeded.
We have made a mistake.
We must change it tomorrow in an oral amendment.
Will discussion alone suffice, I wonder?
I have tabled an amendment for tomorrow's vote.
The third problem is the most crucial.
It is wrong to point to the USA alone.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Shipbuilding (continuation)
Twenty years on will be too late.
It is unacceptable discrimination between the two institutions.
The Commission sees no problems.
There, I disagree.
That is incorrect.
Korea is mentioned specifically, then.
A more biased course of action cannot be imagined.
The industry does not benefit from non-generic support.
The WTO procedure will probably last three years.
Subsidies make for inefficiency and increase costs.
I come from Sweden.
We built the largest oil tanker in history.
That would be an investment for the future.
Our group supports the Commission proposal with amendments.
I will quote one example.
I have also stressed that the crisis is serious.
What have we done so far?
What does the European Parliament want to do?
Parliament shared this view as recently as last year.
Nor, indeed, does it help the environment.
That emphatically is not the Commission's intention.
Firstly, there is the scope of the mechanism.
That is the intention of the amendments put forward.
The Council question time is starting now.
I deeply regret that this is happening.
We must give them the floor.
Question Time (Council)
The second question has been withdrawn.
Question No 3 by (H-0778/01):
The Council is actually inventing the wheel.
My question relates to this issue.
We have just concluded the WTO negotiations.
Question No 4 by (H-0781/01):
I confirm what I just said.
I shall take Islam as an example.
These clarifications can be made later outside the chamber.
Question No 6 by (H-0784/01):
How can these two things be reconciled?
It is up to the President-in-Office of the Council.
Question No 7 by (H-0788/01):
And that is good news.
Question No 8 by (H-0791/01):
This issue is of particular interest to Greece.
Question No 9 by (H-0795/01):
I just wish to clarify something you said.
The base age has been raised by six years.
Question No 10 by (H-0796/01):
Question No 11 by (H-0825/01):
Are they entitled to political asylum?
This obviously applies to all Member States.
Question No 12 by (H-0797/01):
This was also the case before 11 September 2001.
Kabul has fallen.
The Taliban regime is fleeing.
Afghanistan faces a new future.
Are they still there in Kabul?
Have they been taken to Kandahar?
Can we rescue them?
Question No 14 by (H-0806/01):
That goes without saying.
A new opening exists.
Question No 15 by (H-0807/01):
Your reply was really very interesting.
Question No 16 by (H-0810/01):
Question No 17 by (H-0814/01):
Mr President, on a point of order.
It has been communicated to the Council.
Question No 18 by (H-0816/01):
Question No 19 by (H-0824/01):
Perhaps they can find it out now.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Question No 21 by (H-0820/01):
Question No 23 by (H-0838/01):
That concludes Questions to the Council.
Cross-border payments in euro
There is a format to transfer payments fully automatically.
I will now turn my attention to the amendments.
Guarantees concerning cheques are very different in all countries.
Parliament is expected to provide broad support.
This issue is different.
This is an experience familiar to many people.
On 1 January we will get the euro.
We need motorways in the banking sector too.
However, we are waiting on the banks.
The ball is in their court.
It is therefore important to avoid this situation.
We have tabled an amendment in this connection.
Self-regulation in the sector appears not to be working.
Structural problems must not be solved by force.
It is regrettable that this was not achieved.
We need to think of them.
I strongly reject Mr Maaten's proposal.
We should clarify this too.
I hope that you as Commissioner remain resolute.
I remember this well.
That is an important fact.
Secondly, the proposed plan is too late.
That does not pose any problems for the Commission.
We can thus accept that amendment.
Many thanks, Mr President.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco
, rapporteur.
That is the first mistake.
Why does the Commission feel that taxes should converge?
How do we know it will?
Because we have statistics.
But the statistics are based on legal cigarettes.
It confined its comments to its particular field.
The second point concerns Article 3(1).
We believe that this is wrong.
.
So we shall be working counter to our aims.
Is that what we want to achieve?
How clever of us!
That was a mistake on their part.
It is like no other product.
The Commission proposal will help people to stop smoking.
It appears impossible to underpin this position.
The present Commission proposal is consistent with that opinion.
Well, I have some here.
But the amendments require no change to the proposal.
But the form in this respect is important.
That is the Commission's opinion too.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
European Council in spring 2002
This shows that economic policy coordination is working.
I believe that is precisely what Mrs Randzio-Plath wants.
I am not optimistic.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Lastly, I will mention the budgetary aspect.
European solidarity works and continues to work.
That is for the sceptics.
This discriminates against other fishermen and ship owners.
I thank them all for their understanding and solidarity.
I therefore congratulate them.
What is at stake here?
All other rules should be maintained.
I turn to Amendments Nos 14 and 15.
The additional credits are not structural funds.
Then there is Amendment No 16.
But that is a purely mechanical calculation.
Then there is Amendment No 17.
Otherwise it should be adjusted accordingly.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
Many thanks.
Thank you!
Are there any other comments on the Minutes?
It is a great provider to our national economy.
Are there any other comments about the Minutes?
(The Minutes were approved).
The problem lies in encouraging people to be adaptable.
(Applause)
The airlines recently announced 30,000 redundancies.
Their description was most interesting.
The airlines operate in a global village.
Others are due to a fall in demand.
These are the legislative and social tools currently available.
Frankly, what we have heard is totally unacceptable.
Madam President-in-Office, we are in a deep crisis.
Airlines have gone bankrupt.
We need action now.
And what did we do?
That is not enough.
We need direct action now.
If that is so, then I condemn it.
However, there are different ways of handling them.
This problem cannot be solved on a mode-by-mode basis.
The recapitalisation will have to be endorsed by Brussels.
After all, aviation is a worldwide market.
This question is not restricted to aviation.
We must also distinguish between short-term and long-term measures.
The sector will then become truly global.
Secondly, the cause.
Everyone knows that in my country.
People no longer want this kind of Europe.
One thing is clear to me.
We must opt for a European approach.
We must adopt a European approach.
I am in favour of a European approach.
Is anyone really listening to the employees concerned?
This cannot work.
Clearly, 11 September virtually wiped out that business.
We have to take that into account.
And no doubt others will follow.
That may well create more jobs.
That is unacceptable.
A prime example is Alitalia.
That is point one.
This time is no exception.
The Commission has made a very good effort.
What has it done?
It has pulled out of Northern Ireland as well!
I condemn it for that.
I certainly feel very strongly about this.
I am particularly well-placed to know all about that.
Yes, there is aid in various forms.
There has been aid in connection with insurance facilities.
There have been responses.
Two major sets of issues have been debated.
The first relates to the restructuring of the airlines.
The second relates to the need for social intervention.
This works to the detriment of the European airlines.
And the third point relates to state aid.
The law on state aid is not the Koran.
What tool do we have at European level?
Can we decide to give state aid to airlines?
Of course not.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Combating social exclusion
We have urgent challenges to meet.
It has proved its worth in this area.
It is not possible to separate the two problems.
The controversy over the budget arises from this.
You have granted us only five million.
This involvement is critical.
So what does this tool do?
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Announcement by the President
Will that now be at around 3.30 p.m.?
Madam President, on a point of order.
I saw a piece of baggage on a chair.
For approximately 15 minutes nobody came for it.
He was extremely arrogant and annoyed.
He took his bag and marched away.
He said that he knew Mrs Muscardini.
You acted very properly in the circumstances.
Vote
I find the Council' s answer totally unacceptable.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Following the rejection of the proposal by the Commission
That is the first step.
Thank you, Mr Katiforis.
I believe Mr Bolkestein wishes to speak.
That means that the Commission proposal is rejected.
This is an unusual situation.
Parliament asks something of the Commission.
(Applause)
The Rule is clear.
I quite agree, Mr Katiforis.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
Figueiredo report (A5-0372/2001)
Obviously this will no longer be necessary.
.
The euro is good news for European businesses.
It reduces export costs.
Chichester report (A5-0363/2001)
It could be saying anything and its opposite.
To what extent is the nuclear risk acceptable?
The resolution is dotted with pipe dreams.
This is asking the impossible.
We are voting against the motion for a resolution.
This argument is irrational and lacks objectivity.
Otherwise, we will be leaving rational discourse behind.
Flemming report (A5-0341/2001)
, in writing.
This was an absurd and unfounded allegation.
Riis-JÃ¸rgensen report (A5-0373/2001)

Any competitor can easily imitate ingenious systems.
I welcome, in particular, the following points:
Corbey report (A5-0323/2001)
A great deal of material is wasted on it.
I wholeheartedly agree with her attempt to prevent waste.
Salafranca SÃ¡nchez Negra report (A5-0336/2001)
We have consequently voted against this report.
Far from it.
It was scheduled to be debated before twelve noon.
It has overrun.
Who would like to speak out in favour?
That is Mrs Van den Burg.
You have the floor for one minute.
I would therefore like to support the request.
Thank you, Mrs Van den Burg.
Mr Gollnisch would like to speak against the request.
You have one minute.
I wanted to raise the following matter.
Those with staff are, in fact, employers.
If it is, congratulations.
We are agreed on the intention.
We need to tread carefully on this point.
There are some self-employed people who are economically dependent.
I would like to thank you for your contribution.
The debate is now closed.
I thank you.
Oh, I am sorry, Mr Bouwman.
Thank you very much.
New European labour markets
Mr Pronk, you have one minute.
The request is logical in my view.
We have to postpone it.
That is why we support this request.
Mr Pronk is therefore in favour of postponement.
I would now put the request to the vote.
Thank you for your attendance.
I declare the sitting adjourned until 4 p.m.
Topical and urgent debate
Accident in the Gotthard Tunnel
Mr President, it seems to be fate.
I would therefore put two questions to the Commission.
The European Commission has also taken new initiatives.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
Massacre of 200 civilians in the Federal Republic of Nigeria
Unfortunately, Nigeria is an alarming case in point.
Not a month goes by without blood being shed.
The government itself was shrouded in silence.
It is frightening.
Ethnic and religious violence must be stopped in Nigeria.
Corruption from whatever source must be rooted out.
The European Union must support this.
Violent criminals often go unpunished.
Furthermore, its huge diversity could provide real dynamism.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Ãatural disasters
Floods in Algeria
However, what you were saying was interesting.
There is no need to worry at all.
We have only asked this of Cuba.
Floods in Algeria
It is not the first such calamity.
Certainly no sniffer dogs appear to be available.
The dead in Algeria are also our dead.
The homeless in Algeria are also our homeless.
Members of this House have raised two main issues.
One concerns Nicaragua.
The second comment concerned Cuba.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Trade in small arms
Europe must seize the opportunity afforded here.
I am not referring to terrorists there.
Much has been achieved.
Why?
We are talking about devastating weaponry.
And why missionaries, you might ask?
We support the resolution that has been tabled.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
The debate is scheduled for 5.30 p.m.
Announcement by the President
2003, European Year of People with Disabilities
Mr President, I welcome the sign language interpreter.
We need to have concrete outcomes.
All EU citizens should have equal rights.
She uses a wheelchair.
I remonstrated with them.
She had to change hotels.
No taxi in Brussels would stop for her.
She managed to get to a restaurant.
Your appearance will put off other diners."
She remonstrated with the security people.
I hope your plane crashes."!
They suffer multi-discrimination.
This must change.
They can be discriminated against when applying for jobs.
We still have much to do, however.
We need more equality in everyday life.
We need to move from principle to practice.
Secondly, we need more comprehensive integration.
They are not just humane or charitable policies.
Business circles can also play an important part.
We cannot propose and implement policies for the disabled.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Vote
I am very grateful.
That is the end of voting time.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The session was adjourned at 6.50 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Announcement by the President
The death of these journalists illustrates this.
Order of business
(Parliament gave its assent)
(Parliament gave its assent)
The order of business is thus established.
Speeches on points of order
We were given some further details.
Thank you, Mr Souladakis.
Future of the European Union
The next item is the joint debate on:
The report contains some valuable guidance.
Remarkable progress was made in the accession negotiations.
That report will also look to the future.
The Union has established its diplomatic and humanitarian role.
The progress we expected has not been made.
This is the meaning of the so-called Laeken Declaration.
(Applause)
The Presidium has to organise the Convention's work.
That is why the working group is so important.
Overall, the process launched has been successful.
I would like to comment on the Middle East.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Let me make another comment on the Convention.
(Applause)
This is a serious warning.
That is all and there are 13 candidate countries.
Where is your draft European constitution?
Let me return to a number of issues.
One is the principle of political pluralism.
Both sexes also need to be appropriately represented.
Now, let us clear up any confusion.
A federation of national states is a federal state.
That is the real task.
I very much doubt it.
The governments have the same problem.
This method is the Convention.
This is not true.
Make no mistake about the Convention, however.
It is an instrument.
This is also true.
There is no need to constrict the Convention.
Let me highlight some of these.
This is not true.
It means final support for the resulting text.
What is this 'cooling' process?
We have enlargement to prepare for.
But what indication?
This can only be the Intergovernmental Conference.
We want a time-limited 'call-back mechanism'.
Work for all is the objective.
We want a strategy for more and better jobs.
It is absolutely vital that we achieve this objective.
Parliament is often left out in the cold.
We protest against this.
What they need is more staff.
I think that would be a very good idea.
One thing, I believe, must be clear.
I am thus in favour of more positive subsidiarity.
I am pleased with the resolutions before us.
Let us be truly creative for Europe.
We want to see these amended.
We want to improve it.
So what has gone wrong?
Citizens do not feel part of the European family.
We have a fight on our hands.
I find this regrettable.
I could not agree with you more about that.
The EU must become more intelligible and citizen-friendly.
What do we mean by 'succeeding' ?
People cannot understand this and accept this even less.
Firstly, I welcome the Convention.
We are not aiming at unanimity on the reforms.
Fifthly and lastly: the timetable.
That is something people cannot do much about.
The intergovernmental model is out of date.
These rights must become unconditional at EU level.
Our three rapporteurs have presented excellent reports.
I doubt it.
Are there any more topics for the Convention?
Yes, I should like to outline five.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
As is the Convention.
It calls for a more wide-ranging agenda.
This imbalance would, of course, be unacceptable.
I think that this is the exact definition.
I could also put that another way.
We must take this difference into account.
I would like to make something clear.
These are my comments on enlargement.
That is a bit mean.
The question of timing is also important.
Thank you, Mr Michel.
I will now give the floor to Commissioner Barnier.
Mr Voggenhuber accused the Commission of having no vision.
The debate needs to take place.
Let us not be afraid of words.
What do we want to do together?
Do we want to stay where we are?
These are the demands and requests from the people.
And how?
I have heard a group Chairman requesting this.
Thank you, Commissioner Barnier.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Procedural motions (continued)
Thank you.
I now give the floor to Baroness Ludford.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
The points made by all speakers are absolutely clear.
He has been there for three weeks.
Combating terrorism/EUROJUST
Other provisions in what we are proposing do that.
I wish you a successful debate.
, rapporteur.
You know them well enough.
The terrorist threat has only reinforced this intention.
This has necessitated the convening of various extraordinary meetings.
The element of initial intention has been clarified.
This is an essential component.
This is our guiding thought on this matter.
I trust that the Fifteen will share this opinion.
That much is clear.
Today, we are taking a large step forward.
I do not feel this is fair.
Thank you, Madam President.
All of that needs to be reconciled too.
We have always listened to experts.
I categorically refute this.
You will see this from the texts.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Aviation safety
This is self-evident after the events of 11 September.
The two must not be confused.
Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Foster once again.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Communities' financial interests
Why?
We are striving to be that.
The possibilities are already there in the Treaties.
That is not what we have a Commission for.
The Commission bears great responsibility in this respect.
Again a word on that, Mr BÃ¶sch.
And this is beginning to bear fruit.
It is like police statistics.
We cannot do without this mechanism.
You have mentioned this.
Nobody would understand it.
That is not within Parliament' s competence.
However, there is a problem.
This situation is quite pathetic.
What do we do when we find fraud?
This is a real problem.
Who is going to take responsibility for prosecution?
Thank you very much, Mrs Stauner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Quality of petrol and diesel fuels
We are talking about very low contents.
We give this proposal a fair wind.
Is the Commissioner prepared to accede to this demand?
Congratulations are due to the Commission.
It is a matter of balancing out the emissions.
This is the reasoning behind our Amendment No 40.
I invite you to support it.
I have a problem.
This concerns the financial incentives.
Let me turn to some other amendments.
There is humility for you!
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Egypt
The next item is the joint debate on:
and on oral questions:
Here is an opportunity for action.
Egypt is a friend.
I urge the House to support the motion.
It would be irresponsible not to adopt this agreement.
(Parliament rejected the request)
The first cooperation agreement was signed in 1972.
The main objectives of the agreement are as follows.
This shows the interest the report has generated.
This has been highly publicised in Egypt and elsewhere.
We need to look beyond the initial verdicts.
We must be on our guard.
Article 2 cannot therefore be simply a political clause.
It has to have tangible value.
It does not mean penalising it.
Human rights are universal and transcend all borders.
The oral question to the Commission underlines this anxiety.
You do not have time to wait?
No problem.
We obviously have to take up human rights...
(Interruption by Mr Cashman)
Need I say more?
That was not on a point of order!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Aid for reconstruction
We await this report with interest.
That is where the Agency comes in.
Perhaps I shall not need all this time.
Democracy, too, is making progress.
A lot remains to be done, however.
First of all, a word about Macedonia.
The problems have been exacerbated by the conflict.
We then have the matter of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Economic growth has not been particularly good.
Finally, something about the third matter, Yugoslavia.
The process is far from being completed.
Now it is being done in Macedonia.
I saw President Trikovsky earlier this week.
Characteristically, I am not able to do that.
I am happy to do that.
I will tell the Parliament why.
That is also good to hear.
I did it!
To date, we have disbursed EUR 30 million.
The economic situation remains extremely precarious.
The conditions of disbursement are close to being met.
That is certainly the case.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
A lot of time and energy went into it.
I trust the latter will be adopted tomorrow morning.
This is clearly stated in our Amendment No 4.
Parliament cannot abrogate its responsibilities as a budgetary authority.
We promise with pride but we fail to deliver.
Do these people not matter to us?
The Commissioners have gone.
There is no interest.
This is not FYROM or Macedonia.
We want an innovative and workable governance framework.
Furthermore, this will come from the existing budget.
This is not extra money.
These funds are not ongoing.
What is the aim of this fund?
Is it only for prevention?
Will it provide health care infrastructures and medicines?
These are the questions we must ask.
How will this fund be managed?
It is not simply up to the donor countries.
Who will manage these funds?
This is totally unacceptable.
We still have many unanswered questions.
We still have to discuss the level of funding.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 00.05 a.m.)
Human genetics
I believe we should uphold these points.
People are right to be concerned.
The first problem concerns the embryo.
There is nothing more to be said.
That is what the Fiori report says.
Each needs the other.
Its work has certainly not been conducted openly.
Human life is not a consumable commodity.
Human life is not created by third parties.
We, therefore, need a very clear signal.
Europe must not be an ethical minefield.
We need clear ethical boundaries.
Research itself is impossible to imagine without risks.
That is politics, not research.
We have therefore re-tabled it.
It is complicated and it is difficult.
A creation which God imbued with numerous possibilities.
Should we not develop and use them?
The spirit of Galileo is with us today.
Thank you, Mr Vidal-Quadras.
I agree with you.
We have interviewed many experts and made many visits.
I reject the production of embryos solely for research.
I am thoroughly disappointed.
The European Parliament must not fail here.
We must set standards here.
But there is a lot of clarity here.
Sometimes we simply do not see it.
All we have to do is stick to it.
It cannot be allowed.
I will leave the matter there.
I think that is really where the future lies.
There is no trace of subsidiarity in this report.
The discussion is sometimes about extremes.
I reject both extremes.
Life is undoubtedly a process.
An ovum that is not fertilised ceases to live.
Why should there be special rules for embryos alone?
Nor can we neglect research into embryonic stem cells.
Our view is clear.
What is our conception of the human being?
What constitutes the dignity of the human being?
What is the point of scientific research?
Our position must therefore be consistent and well founded.
I believe that Parliament must firmly reject human cloning.
Patent protection must be excluded from such experimentation.
What is human dignity?
Transposition, however, is years behind.
Commissioner, please be robust.
Please stand up for the future of Europe.
Who has the final say over the human body?
The bio-patent directive regulates that power.
Unfortunately this directive is not completely transparent.
We must provide a counterweight.
There must be public influence on a research agenda.
What is the real issue here?
These proposals are restrictive and extreme.
They do not reflect a sensible and balanced approach.
Let me be quite clear.
Ethical boundaries have clearly been crossed.
Every human being has the right to uniqueness.
This is an irritatingly inaccurate and careless statement.
Is there a right to life-long health?
New techniques are available.
We are being promised cures to many diseases.
It can also be used reproductively.
No, it is not acceptable.
It is more like a modern form of cannibalism.
There are no ethical objections to such alternatives.
It is up to politics to set boundaries.
We must decide.
No human germ line intervention.
Let us be courageous and set tight limits.
It is high time we did.
I congratulate Mr Fiori.
I now come to the major issues at stake.
There is no doubt that case law will develop.
On certain fundamental principles there is unanimous agreement.
Thus human reproductive cloning is universally condemned.
It seeks to encourage public debate on these issues.

In English, it is worded as follows:
"...
Failing that, apply Article 40 ..."
Thank you very much, Madam President.
Of course, Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­.
I fully understand what you are saying.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Regarding Paragraph 19
I trust that honourable Members will have no objection.
Regarding Amendment Nos 10 and 23
Both amendments will be put to the vote.
I spoke before the vote.
So the amendment we accepted goes further.
In that respect we have decided correctly.
Regarding Amendment No 2
Then continue as in the text.
There is a practical reason for this.
That is the oral amendment.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, number 18 is only a reordering.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Thank you very much, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
Thank you, Mr Bayrou.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Of course this can be done.
The letter is by no means confidential.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Regarding Amendment No 126
This is extremely serious, Mrs Flesch.
Regarding Amendment No 51
Regarding Paragraph 95
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
We shall certainly investigate this information, Mrs Figueiredo.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Dell'Alba report (A5-0176/2001)
Bouwman report (A5-0348/2001)
.
.
I asked for roll-call votes to make sure.
.
Foster report (A5-0415/2001)
.
This shows utter disregard for everyone.
We have, therefore, voted against this report.
.
.
Theato report (A5-0390/2001)
It is incorrect and it is wrong.
Hautala report (A5-0389/2001)
.
Hugues Martin recommendation (A5-0387/2001)
Why did I vote against it?
.
.
.
.
That is why I will vote against this report.
Watson report (A5-0397/2001)
.
.
We cannot be party to this sort of approach.
It does nothing of the kind.
.
They call for a positive list.
1.
2.
3.
4.
Hence my vote against it.
.
The European Parliament has closed its eyes.
.
.
.
.
.
We also support a European arrest warrant.
.
Gebhardt report (A5-0398/2001)

FÃ¤rm report (A5-0411/2001)
.
This role of melting pot proved unsuccessful.
Lagendijk report (A5-0386/2001) and
We have voted against it.
I therefore voted against the report.
.
It still represents certainty in a difficult economic climate.
.
.
Both rapporteurs are right to opt for more democracy.
.
.
I ask Parliament's Bureau to look into this.
Kaufmann report (A5-0399/2001)
BÃ¶sch report (A5-0393/2001)
.
Agreement with Egypt (B5-0740/2001)
.
Fiori report (A5-0391/2001)
Why did I vote against it?
Why am I worried?
Love, Madam President!
What can this be attributed to?
Why is it unfortunate not to have a report?
Neither have we made any agreements on genetic tests.
.
.
Some research may lead to excesses?
No doubt.
.
.
This vote represents an unprecedented halt for European research.
That must not be permitted.
.
.
.
.
.
That concludes the statements on the vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament suspended.
(The sitting was closed at 2.13 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of Thursday 29 November have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
Order of business
Regarding Tuesday President.
Is there a speaker to move this request?
I cannot really imagine this.
I shall now put the request to the vote.
(Parliament gave its assent)
(Parliament gave its assent)
Regarding Wednesday
I do not think we need to resend them.
They can be consulted without difficulty.
Regarding Thursday
Both islands are part of one country, Indonesia.
(Parliament gave its assent)
The order of business is thus established.
Speeches on points of order
We received no reply to that letter.
I expect better from the President of the Commission.
My statement is as follows:
(Applause from the left)
(Applause from the left and the centre)
It is silly to confuse the issue.
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
That is not yet the case at the moment.
Could I also ask, Madam President...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
I have two points.
People are focusing on the wrong aspect.
Certainly, Mr Fitzsimons.
(The speaker brandished a poster)
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is the request I would like to make.
Thank you.
Are we all thieves?
Are we all idlers?
I do not think so.
The title says it all.
Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo, for this information.
They are protesting about policy to date.
European Food Authority
There should not be any undue delay.
These are substantial powers.
Now I am reciprocating as shadow for his report.
Then of course it is up to us.
The first is the quality of the experts.
Safety has to be assessed.
That is one step.
It is a large step and also the first.
Otherwise, it will be merely hot air.
We often see this in the food industry too.
Secondly, the diversity of food is highlighted.
For us, this clarification is important.
We think that is incredibly important.
It has not been an easy task.
Thank you.
It must also work together with the national agencies.
The Management Board has a political and managerial role.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Their priority is to collect sufficient food to survive.
This applies even more to the executive director.
The first of these is adequate financial provision.
Who authorises this monitoring?
What do we actually mean by food safety?
I have a few concerns in this respect.
That is one side of the coin.
The same also applies to product organisations.
The list goes on.
Risk communication will also be a key element.
(The President cut the speaker off)
One last question is that of the site.
The Commission welcomes this.
Electronic communications networks and services
Thank you very much indeed.
First, then, the Authorisation Directive.
My second report is on the Radio Spectrum Decision.
Two points have emerged.
This Parliament unanimously advocated this in all the negotiations.
The most difficult matters have been dealt with here.
That is the direction we want to move in.
Allow me to outline the process we went through.
Article 6 has been mentioned many times.
One can appreciate it at different levels.
You said that we have reached a good compromise.
It is an acceptable compromise.
Mr van Velzen hit the right note.
We have not used the word 'veto' .
There is an interesting definition of transnational markets.
And we can only achieve this in this way.
We are not giving anything away here.
I will take a slightly different perspective.
Finally, the eSchola initiative is a great one.
I say, let the market provide the answer.
We should support the compromise in the Paasilinna report.
The market cannot therefore be researched.
What I have in mind is digital television.
I would like to highlight another point.
This can hardly be the way into the future.
A new framework is therefore necessary.
It is not a question of more regulation.
Regulation is necessary both economically and socially.
It is necessary therefore to get the balance right.
What effects can we expect to see on jobs?
We still have two weeks to go.
It is, of course, a compromise.
Commission decisions are subject to an advisory committee procedure.
We must absolutely encourage their use.
The same was true with the e-government conference.
We proceed along those lines.
I will come back to that later.
The compromise package is always a compromise.
No institution gets everything it wants.
But this compromise is a balanced one.
It has been an extremely complicated legal package.
Everybody had a role to play.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Report on financial assistance for innovative and job creating SMEs
But these things happen.
If this is true it is most welcome.
I want to believe it.
I would love to see the evidence.
Support is meant to be transparent.
Parliament approved a budget of EUR 450 million.
SMEs are an engine for jobs in Europe.
They need improved access to risk capital.
If that is not a success...
Obviously there were too many services dealing with it.
What about the quality of jobs in innovative fields?
How is sustainability ensured?
Thank you, Mr President.
I shall of course vote against this report.
Firstly on the provision of information.
Secondly, on geographical coverage.
Thirdly, on the instruments.
Circulation of compound feedingstuffs
But a good thing is worth waiting for.
We now have open declaration.
So, many thanks.
Thirdly, there is the positive list.
Here, Parliament achieved what it wanted.
Now it is being reinstated.
This was the right step in the right direction.
These principles can apply to all feeds to animals.
This task is very complex.
Thank you very much Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 9.30 p.m.)
Vote on requests for urgent procedure
Katiforis (PSE).
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
President.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
President.
We would propose an urgent procedure without report.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
A strong Commission means a strong European Parliament.
We have made sure we complied with that request.
My major concerns relate more to the long term.
Europe does indeed need structural reform.
We already have the right recipe.
So where do these worries stem from?
Enlargement is an accomplishment of historic significance.
I would however like to make a few comments.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
(Applause)
We also support what you have said about enlargement.
I shall wind up now, Madam President.
(Applause)
But that is your problem.
You must fulfil your commitments to Parliament.
Is it proportionate?
Does it respect subsidiarity?
Is it transparent and accountable?
What are the options for implementation?
Our Conference of Presidents backs what she has said.
We have got to get it right.
That is all very well.
We agree.
This is astonishing at the very least.
Why?
What ideal are we talking about then?
Parliament' s group chairpersons have repeated the request.
Still we have not received them.
We are humiliated the whole time.
That is not only a right we possess.
That is impossible.
Why is this totally insufficient?
Secondly, we have a lack of detail.
But the Commission, too, has implementation problems.
Now let us talk about the future, however.
Follow-up and evaluation must also be improved.
New procedures must be agreed by both institutions.
I have several things to say on this point.
I fully agree with this sentiment.
It will be an extremely important time.
The debate is closed.
WTO meeting in Qatar
Even NGOs have received the Agreement favourably.
This is a very important breakthrough.
The organisation of internal works at Doha was exemplary.
The credibility of the WTO has been restored.
Thank you for your attention.
That is an important new development.
That, too, is good news.
The WTO is one of those pillars.
I am referring to the social issues.
We regret that.
That is not a reason for giving up.
So that is where we stand at the moment.
My final point concerns agriculture.
I have said it in public.
(Applause)
Lastly, the text deals with non-trade concerns.
We are going to have to interrupt this debate.
Now is the time for delivery.
Let me remind you of what Jamaica said.
I could give you many more similar quotations.
This is the bottom line.
Therefore, the agenda should not be expanded.
I regard this incident as a very serious one.
We shall now proceed to the vote.

Bushill-Matthews report (A5-0422/2001)
All I need is the money!"
.
.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
I shall come back to this in due course.
I thank you for your attention.
They went far beyond the call of duty.
Once again, thank you all very much.
Unfortunately, I did not do this.
The budget is a means, not an end.
There is a technical contradiction here.
This is the real increase.
That is what we do not like.
Praise the Lord!
This is the key point of our report.
I know his reasons why.
I have spoken to him about them.
That was an issue in itself.
The Council did not really like this idea anyway.
It is the consequences of pre-enlargement.
It is not necessarily enlargement itself.
What are we going to do about that?
Where is that money going to come from?
There is no room at present in heading 4.
I would also like to mention Mr SeppÃ¤nen.
That is also worth emphasising.
Further aid is also needed for Palestine.
That would of course be totally unacceptable.
That was also laid down in the interinstitutional agreement.
Thank you, Mr Tajani.
This is good news for everyone.
We are actually getting somewhere this year.
No European refugee fund.
That brings me to the third problem.
The Council did not accept this at second reading.
Something else, too, about the new agencies.
This concentrates largely on preparations for enlargement.
But that is a matter for next year.
There was nothing else to be done.
Of that I am convinced.
B: on the monitoring of fishing activity.
Dialogue must be put on a formal basis.
Enlargement is drawing ever nearer.
The agricultural budget is realistic.
This was immensely important for my group.
Our group supports all these decisions.
The EU does not have a money shortage.
That is evident from the financial statements for 2000.
This was illustrated yet again this year.
The second point concerns the flexibility instrument.
What bothers me is the financing method.
This Parliament wants to be close to the citizen.
I find that quite unacceptable.
Many thanks.
Allow me a brief remark in parenthesis.
We also have fundamental matters to deal with.
The Balkans must continue to receive attention.
So must the Mediterranean region.
Silent agony, however, is easily neglected.
We must keep closer watch.
Nonetheless, I have three comments to make.
The first concerns the reform.
Let me remind you of them.
Thank you, Mr President.
What will the Commission do in that case?
I do not want to smash the project.
That is not my agenda.
Thanks also to Mr Turchi for his report.
Many comments related to the implementation of the budget.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Determination of Member States' payments to VAT-based own resource
This revised system superseded the old ESA 1979.
Its use was made compulsory for all Member States.
Sheer balderdash!
Huh!
So much for the constant preaching about transparency!
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
What are his or her powers?
Who supervises the actions of the Public Prosecutor?
Which principles underlie the Green Paper?
What does that mean in detail?
This approach respects the national legal system.
Another is Eurojust.
We need the widest possible feedback on our proposal.
We must be prepared for a long haul.
Will it lead to corpus juris?
What powers would he or she have?
What are the Community's financial interests?
That is something we do not recognise.
This is indeed a correct account.
It is that procedure that we must apply.
I wonder if you could comment on that.
In other words, Eurojust will simply not work.
Thank you very much.
We must look at it in a complementary way.
Thank you, Mr President.
What the Commissioner is saying all sounds encouraging.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
You must not enter into a dialogue.
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
Question No 39 by (H-0878/01):
Thank you Commissioner for a very full answer.
Everybody is aware that this is very difficult.
Therefore it is a very serious problem.
So Slovenia has got a real problem.
We know that there is a real problem.
There are numerous problems.
What programmes are in fact available to these states?
This is just one other application.
Cooperation is being strengthened across a range of sectors.
Question No 41 by (H-0917/01):
It was very strange to experience.
Knowledge, as such, is a strong weapon.
It is a moral issue.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Second part Questions to Commissioner Diamantopoulou
Surely these directives have a bearing on the matter?
Mr President, I actually have a further question.
Question No 45 by (H-0873/01):
Obviously, you do not lie.
This is no longer acceptable.
Employment statistics are certainly extremely important in combating unemployment.
Question No 46 by (H-0912/01):
But how do you intend to change the climate?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
Question No 42 by (H-0895/01):
Participation in these various dialogues is open.
I have two follow-up questions.
My first is as follows.
This is being done in conjunction with these events.
Question No 43 by (H-0935/01):
That is true.
We worked together with them at Doha.
I spoke to you this morning on that subject.
That basically leaves 20%.
Thank you very much, Mr Lamy.
Questions to Commissioner Byrne
Question No 47 by (H-0880/01):
This opinion is expected early in 2002.
Mrs McKenna has the floor for a supplementary question.
Therefore I cannot give the commitment you seek.
Question No 49 by (H-0908/01):
This is an internationally applied approach.
To set unachievable limits is not defensible.
Thank you very much for your answer.
I must ask a couple of supplementary questions.
You then asked me about shellfish.
Question No 48 by (H-0889/01):
Is the Commission aware of this new Danish system?
This is in line with the principle of subsidiarity.
Question No 50 by (H-0942/01):
Is that correct?
I should just like to clarify this.
The Commission has conducted an investigation in Greece.
What is going on?
By which I mean as regards BSE.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
WTO meeting in Qatar (continuation)
Essential elements of our pre-conference resolution were included.
(The President cut the speaker off)
In Qatar, we saw a breakthrough.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is an unusually impudent lie.
Thank you, Madam President.
This objective has been partly achieved.
Yet for whom was it a success?
The clichÃ©s are piling up.
Korea has maybe stayed with it.
The European Union is showing cracks.
In addition, Europe obtained a reprieve.
First of all there was the agricultural reprieve.
We also obtained a reprieve for foreign investments.
We also obtained a reprieve on pensions.
What will remain of Europe?
The EU had its way in agricultural issues.
We are opposed to total liberalisation.
Changes to the agenda are just as important.
Madam President, congratulations on being seated there today.
I would also like to thank the Council.
Let me make another point.
After Doha that has changed.
I have two specific questions, Commissioner.
The 77 ACP countries succeeded in obtaining a waiver.
They put out a brilliant declaration before Doha.
I have had several meetings with them since then.
They are well pleased with the results.
Doha should have been the development cycle.
Yet what have the developing countries gained from Doha?
I have just one question to ask the Commissioner.
But let there be no illusions.
Now, though, to my main criticism.
What has become of our social responsibility?
I warn against taking conflict prevention too lightly.
I hesitate.
It is permissible to doubt.
Lastly, if the failure...
(The President cut the speaker off)
I now give Commissioner Fischler the floor.
That is both an opportunity and a responsibility.
I take a somewhat different view of this.
We shall try to do better next time.
Once again that rule has proved to be true.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Public health (2001 - 2006)
rapporteur.
Finally, the budget.
The programme must be adequately funded.
Amendment Nos 16, 22 and 47 are essential.
There is a problem here.
It is in Europe' s interest.
The idea of profitability is becoming more generalised.
Local hospitals and maternity hospitals are being closed down.
A proper public health policy implies disease prevention.
However, this appears to be a hollow phrase.
We should make sure that this programme matters.
My second point relates to complementary medicine.
We must live in the real world.
First, the implementation of the programme.
I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 36.
Therefore we cannot accept these amendments.
Therefore, we cannot accept these amendments.
The debate is closed.
Undesirable substances in animal feed
The groups have come to an agreement among themselves.
We ask ourselves questions and we face responsibilities.
What happens to feedingstuffs like that?
It should be available before this directive becomes applicable.
Emissions from two and three-wheel motor vehicles
We must make the 2006 stage mandatory.
Thank you, Madam President.
Catalytic converters in lorries will be compulsory in 2008.
This was not so difficult to achieve.
Today, we are discussing new motorcycles.
This is a fair position.
Conciliation will now be inevitable.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikaanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.
We are pleased to welcome you here today.
This sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment.
(Applause)
Madam President, Commissioner Prodi, distinguished guests.
I thank you all.
Developing nations are being overlooked.
Meanwhile, cultural conflicts are arising.
We must stop this.
Korea will actively participate.
Economically, they produce half the world's products.
This is the goal and ideal of ASEM.
Korea is opening its doors to EU members.
Unification will come.
Terrorism must be eradicated.
Peace and security is the task of our time.
We will give humanity hope for the future.
For all this, we thank you Mr President.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
I will raise that matter with the President.
We are expecting him to arrive at some stage.
We look forward to the Minister's arrival.
That is the difficulty that we are in.
So I am afraid that cannot be instituted.
Area of freedom, security and justice
The Geneva Convention forms the basis of asylum policy.
Furthermore, should the Dublin Convention not be reviewed?
Has cooperation been reduced to financing extradition?
(The President cut the speaker off)
We cannot start off the day running overtime.
The Union is at a crossroads.
Some of these objectives have been listed.
The progress made since Tampere is not very encouraging.
Whose fault is that?
Today, we must seize the moment...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Many thanks, Commissioner Vitorino!
Cooperation with the Council leaves something to be desired.
We are increasingly getting documents at the last moment.
This is not on.
Europe has put its house in order.
Europe has shown its capacity to act.
What, then, are our values and principles?
We must vote against this resolution!
There are similar guarantees for the European arrest warrant.
Nonetheless we must remain objective.
These efforts have not been fruitless.
The Council is aware of this matter.
These conventions must be ratified within carefully defined deadlines.
Various scenarios are being examined.
The Presidency has made this a priority.
We have never appealed to you in vain.
Fortunately most of Parliament has understood this.
What does Mr Berlusconi have to say about it?
I quote word for word.
(Applause)
Sir, your speaking time is up.
Mr Tajani has a point of order.
Should I have the visitors removed from the gallery?
Should I have their hands tied behind their backs?
They may be guilty at most of a misdemeanour.
Absolutely not, in most cases.
First there are the candidate countries.
Hence the need for external action.
We have two types of external action.
It is also a question of our resources.
It was dragged away from the gates of Laeken.
How pleased should we be now?
The end clearly does not justify the means.
Here too, we must not exaggerate.
Because security is merely an instrument to ensure freedom.
Security loses its meaning when it prejudices freedom.
Security without freedom is tyranny.
We are living in a world of paradoxes.
Let me start with the past.
And finally to the future.
That is the first point I want to clarify.
This needs to be said very plainly.
I have no illusions, however.
(Applause from the left)
The debate is closed.
This is Parliament, not the Strasbourg stadium!
Mrs Fontaine replied that it would be done.
These letters have still not been made public.
Vigorous applause then broke out in the galleries.
(Vigorous applause)
We shall now proceed to the vote.

It really is not on!
That was a compromise.
That access provision is the key concern of colleagues.
Did I mishear that?
Perhaps the Commissioner would like to repeat this part?
This can be and will be considered.
The Commission can accept in part ten amendments.

Middle East
Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, you have the floor.
Other external players should follow this example.
Lastly, the political negotiations have two objectives.
(Applause)
Today, that prospect seems all too distant.
We understand Israel's longing for security.
I would strongly argue the opposite.
I have heard that remark in this Chamber.
I want to make this point very strongly.
There is much further to go.
The alternative to the Palestinian Authority is Palestinian anarchy.
One final point.
Today the focus is mainly on Afghanistan.
But increasingly it will shift to the Middle East.
What is past is past.
That is an absolute requirement.
But we must go on.
Let us follow their example.
In a conflict there needs to be strong advocates.
What does that mean from my point of view?
Those responsible must be arrested, tried and punished.
Their struggle must remind us of our responsibilities.
To give them rights?
So you want to give them a national State.
The illusion of possible national independence affects Israel too.
Our pleas for democracy and Europe went unheeded.
Do not take sides.
Be good Samaritans.
We will vote accordingly.
The European Union should lead this action.
We can and must undertake to do this.
The international community wants peace.
It is however misconceived.
We feel impotent, concerned and extremely angry.
We see it every day.
Europe is resolutely taking this line.
There is no equality between occupied and occupier.
People who have hope have something to lose.
The violence is terrible.
So indeed is the spiral of violence.
That is our most fervent hope.
That is not the case.
Those figures are extremely approximate.
It must be halted.
It must be ended.
That is a balanced European Union policy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Access to documents as implemented by Council and Commission
These are as follows.
And that is what concerns us.
How far have we got in this regard?
Some changes were needed.
Work is under way on this issue too.
I hope this will happen soon.
It seems to me that this is not acceptable.
Is that wise?
I cannot find it.
And then the security rules.
Nothing has been published about these either.
I am very hesitant about that.
Why?
Has the Commission adopted security rules?
When will Parliament adopt its own security rules?
Politicians must be accountable and responsible for their decisions.
I would like to mention some of these.
'May we see the telephone directory?'
'How many laws are there?'
'Sorry, we are not counting.'
'How many projects are you running?'
'We stopped counting when we reached 100 000.'
'How many committees are there?'
'Sorry, that is a secret.'
'Who takes part in the preparative meetings?'
'That is unfortunately something we do not know.'
'Sorry.'
That is when secrecy and cover-up begin.
The Commission would show it is doing its job.
As for the answers, they are top secret.
The ECJ insisted that the documents were presented.
That is right.
I think you understand this.
Maybe other regulations will go further.
The regulation is an initial response to this.
We must also respond in other ways.
I would like to respond to this.
This is all I wanted to say to you.
Thank you again for your contributions and your vigilance.
Your reactions came as no surprise to me.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We have not.
That was agreed.
So there is nothing new.
We were given promises from both...
(The President cut the speaker off)
That has not been addressed.
This is not contained in the regulation.
Question Time (Council)
We will examine questions to the Council
We welcome Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, President-in-Office of the Council.
Question No 1 by (H-0861/01):
Question No 2 by (H-0862/01):
Question No 4 by (H-0864/01):
The Committee itself is keeping tight-lipped.
Madrid is a difficult customer in this regional issue.
I am sorry, I do not know.
I apologise.
This was the first point I wanted to make.
He said 79 million.
79 million for Andarpradesh, just imagine.
This compares to a large Member State in Europe.
But this is not how things work, evidently.
This poses no problem.
This is our ongoing policy.
I repeat, that is not the question.
That is genuinely appreciated.
We can read it together afterwards.
This is a joint answer.
Question No 5 by (H-0865/01):
Time is not on our side.
Question No 6 by (H-0869/01):
The presidency is in contact with Mr Baker.
This answer with real content is very welcome.
Thank you.
Question No 7 by (H-0874/01):
I would just like to put two specific questions.
Question No 8 by (H-0876/01):
I can only repeat the same answer.
Question No 9 by (H-0879/01)
This is something that is on the increase.
Thank you very much.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Conflict prevention
I now give the floor to Mr Lagendijk.
Everyone is in favour of conflict prevention.
Why not?
What do I mean by this?
We have competences in this area.
It is used as a last resort.
But ultimately it is also about political will.
Solving these structural problems is both crucial and difficult.
Unexpected support from an opponent?
I have my reservations about this.
The funding and the framework are in place.
Rather, it brought shame on this House.
That is something I view in positive terms.
The Sakharov Prize is not enough.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is a topical debate.
Mr Wiersma suggested it was a Dutch hobby.
Let me be crystal clear.
Nothing excuses or mitigates terrorism.
It is based on four main objectives.
On all these fronts, the challenge is immense.
The honourable Member raised this.
Mr SacrÃ©deus raised this as well.
The UN is a key partner here.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
EU Relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran
Mr Gahler has the floor.
, rapporteur.
There is an extensive agenda for this dialogue.
I hope I can count on your support.
Full compliance with these agreements is essential.
But unfortunately things have slipped in the last year.
I know that our Iranian counterparts do as well.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Improved relations should not lead to criticism being weakened.
I see this as watering down.
That is more or less what our report says.
We need to be in favour of the reforms.
Not for the reformists or against the conservatives.
They do not eschew highly repressive means.
We are on the side of the Iranian reformists.
We must lend a truly helping hand.
Thank you, Mr Belder.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Maritime safety
The next item is the joint debate on:
Together we have achieved a great deal.
I will not dwell on the other reports.
My fellow rapporteurs will do that.
The classification society controls had failed.
That is an innovation and I welcome it.
The black box will change the culture of shipping.
But we must remain vigilant.
That is our duty and responsibility.
I hope we can live up to that.
We should let the whole world know that.
No!
I am relying on you to push for this.
rapporteur.
It should be done more quickly next time!
The results are actually quite respectable.
The legal framework is in place.
What use is port state control without controllers?
So here are two more points.
One is something I have already mentioned.
Inspections of vessels must also be increased.
However, I regularly suffer nightmares.
I would like to finish off with one point.
Hardly any of the victims have received compensation.
The first question relates to compensation.
All the victims must be fully compensated.
I urge them to do so.
This situation is particularly hazardous.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am optimistic.
Mr Souchet thought that the progress made was slow.
I think that he is right.
This must be seen as clear progress.
The risk of being prosecuted is also very small.
I would like to clarify certain matters.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Cross-border provision of occupational pensions
This illustrates the urgency of this dossier.
It also illustrates that the report is broad-based.
The first success has therefore been achieved.
This should not be unlimited in my view.
This situation shows the problems we shall face.
I congratulate you.
With which individual demands is the Council having difficulty?
We want answers.
And this is not the case here.
Last month, a second case came to light.
These questions have been received.
Everyone is familiar with it.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Financial collateral arrangements
Many thanks!
Now I come to the tabled amendments.
We thank you on behalf of Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m.)
Award of Sakharov Prize 2001
(Loud applause)
Far from it.
(Loud and sustained applause)
The Palestinians talked about their daily suffering under occupation.
Both attraction and excitement arise from this tremendous past.
Man is holy.
We are fed up with the illusion of victory.
I believed and that was why I spoke out.
The war in Angola has various causes.
No more violence!'
But to whom, this time?
Because we can still make up for lost time.
'I no longer wait
I am the man for whom others wait'
Help them to live!
So, my friends, help Angola to live!
Thank you very much!
(Loud, sustained applause)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mr RÃ¼big.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
Order of business
Thank you, Mr Di Lello Finuoli.
Decision on urgent procedure
Thank you, Mr Watson.
Does any Member wish to speak against the request?
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure)
Vote
So thank you very much.
Great dedication was shown.
Once again, thank you all very much.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Costa Neves.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Costa Neves and Buitenweg report (A5-0400/2001)
.
Wynn report (A5-0447/2001)

All of these are Objective 1 regions.

This would be typical of the Council.
We voted in favour, but without enthusiasm.
Peijs report (A5-0453/2001)
Similar percentages are replicated at European level.
Motion for a resolution (B5-0747/2001)

Van den Burg report (A5-0388/2001)
Rights of homosexuals in EU institutions
Allow me to mention four very important points.
There have been very positive developments in recent years.
I would therefore very much welcome your proposal.
I have a couple of questions in that connection.
Where will the Commission draw the line?
They have, however, set things in motion.
Finally, a word on costs.
That is really what we are discussing here.
That is an important point.
I would like to encourage him further.
But I welcome the signs of change.
That is discrimination.
I look forward to Commissioner Kinnock's replies.
Thank you, Mr President.
As yet we have had no answer from you.
Can you, Commissioner, give us one today?
My point directly follows on from Mrs Eriksson's.
Why should this be the case?
We are not in either of those categories.
I would repeat the point I made earlier.
Secondly, on the timetable.
That is not the case.
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Flags of convenience in fisheries
There are also serious social problems.
They are responsible for many other offences.
Fishing is now a global industry.
Markets are also global.
Capital is perhaps the most global commodity of all.
EU fisheries investments can be found in many countries.
Many EU-owned vessels use flags of convenience.
These programmes are funded by both government and industry.
We should go in that direction also.
All of these issues are in the report.
Even in Europe we can and must act.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen.
The Commission has not been sitting on its hands.
What will this entail?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
EC/Islamic Republic of Mauritania fisheries agreement
The previous protocol expired on 31 July 2001.
The protocol before Parliament today reflects this need.
Parliament has a right to know.
I am curious.
This agreement is morally bankrupt.
This is the reality.
It is set to continue - and why?
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen.
So what exactly is the truth?
That is the reality.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Production and marketing of honey
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
No.
The Commission needs to come to its senses.
Errare humanum est, perseverare diabolicum.
You understand that, Mr Fischler.
Furthermore, we should create a COM for honey.
I congratulate Mrs Lulling on her magnificent work.
They are all the more deserving of our attention.
This is a matter of great urgency.
We Members must sound the alarm.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen.
That would be a real pity.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
This sort of treatment is quite simply unacceptable.
Thank you for your observations.
Topical and urgent debate
Zimbabwe
on Zimbabwe
This of course runs counter to freedom of expression.
In this way opinion forming is hampered.
We have been wrong every time.
There are no such glimmers.
The situation is alarming.
Freedom of expression is totally restricted.
Opposition politicians go in fear of their lives.
Let us not dilute the message in any way.
The resolution is a basis for action now.
However, Zimbabwean political reality looks completely different.
Mugabe has failed in implementing these reforms.
He has failed to settle the poor black families.
He has made the poor even poorer.
Zimbabwe needs a free and fair election now.
Mugabe should not fear.
He will be judged on his record.
We do not have an indication of another date.
The idea is to hold them next month.
The regional dimension is important.
I must confess that the outlook is not optimistic.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Cluster bombs
on cluster bombs.
Mr President, I believe it should be banned.
As simple as that.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
So much for the theory.
In practice, things are very different.
Our call is to these people.
Europe must support such a moratorium unequivocally.
We must tread very carefully in this particular war.
This approach is broadly shared by the EU.
Parliament's initiative is therefore particularly timely and welcome.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
Women in Afghanistan
Our summit in Brussels certainly helped here.
Instead, this must be a right.
The 29-strong transitional government will include two women.
They were banned from public life.
Afghanistan is now at an historical crossroad.
Everyone is still afraid.
Everybody is talking about the rights of Afghan women.
We all know the Afghanistan of the warlords.
But there is an alternative Afghanistan.
Only a few hands were somewhat hesitantly raised.
Now we are fortunately in the post-Taliban era.
I must warn you not to expect miracles.
There are many deep-seated differences.
Indonesia
The opposite turns out to be true.
The attackers checked the passengers' religious identity.
That still underlies many complex conflicts.
This is clear in Papua.
The same applies to Sulawesi.
(Parliament rose and observed one minute's silence)
Immigration in Ireland
Fighting terrorism today also means fighting this poverty.
Lessons have to be learnt from this tragedy.
Witnessing it last Saturday will remain with me forever.
We honour victims with one minute's silence.
They have hopes for a better life.
The same thing happened in Dover a year ago.
This situation cannot continue.
We must look forward.
The Union is indeed behind schedule in these areas.
Togo
His only crime is to have criticised the regime.
Democracy does not consist solely of holding elections.
We shall be able to organise our practical cooperation.
We are not calling for a pardon.
EyadÃ©ma is playing cat and mouse with us.
We support the Commission in suspending development aid.
Recent reports suggest that more journalists have been arrested.
We are all aware of this.
They are also both female politicians.
Why?
That is not enough, however.
My sympathy also goes out to Leyla Zana.
All the groups are agreed.
Thank you for listening.
We attach great importance to this.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken today at 6.30 p.m.
Nepal
on the situation in Nepal.
Children' s development in Nepal is extremely problematic.
Illiteracy is another major problem.
Those I spoke to did not agree.
However, political measures must take precedence.
King Gyanendra deserves our full support.
The people deserve proper measures to fight poverty.
They are excellent.
The Maoists have meanwhile occupied part of the country.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
The Congo
In Kinshasa they think the latter.
It is not up to us.
Villages and towns are destroyed.
The UN passed resolution 1376 on 7 November 2001.
These measures are essential.
How are they going to be implemented?
Who will lead this action?
The EU, the USA or the UN?
A veteran politician from DRC was there.
I could not answer.
He asked a second question.
I could not answer that either.
The Commission has always been supportive of the Congo.
This is the core of it.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
But we have to offer them these chances.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Language diversity
We do not want any legal wranglings about that.
It would simply formalise that procedure.
These are not radical proposals.
Europe's unique richness is its diversity.
Let us ensure that we all protect this.
Just a personal comment at the outset.
My spokesman does not speak Danish.
The flow of work would simply choke.
We mean the same thing.
We just need less flippancy here.
But we should walk before we insist on running.
That would probably be asking too much.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Vote
We will now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
The title is not correct.
European languages, not any old languages!
I do not agree.
Colleagues, we appear to have a difficulty.
That is what is used throughout the document.
Mr President, lesser-used European languages is correct.
Is that acceptable to the House?
Regional and lesser-used languages of the European Union.
There is no other option.
'Regional and lesser-used European languages' .
Is that acceptable?
In Europe there are about 300.
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution) President.
That concludes the vote.
- McKenna report (A5-0405/2001)
Gallagher report (A5-0426/2001)
Nobilia report (A5-0375/2001)
How could I not have done so?
We must have a single European pension.
Lulling report (A5-0381/2001)
Mrs Lulling, what can be sweeter than honey?
What can be more nutritious than honey?
Resolution on linguistic diversity
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 6.55 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
Confusion abounds.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
Announcement by the President
I am not going to make a speech.
(The House gave the President a standing ovation)
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you for this.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
(Applause)
I thank you for doing that.
You strongly promoted the case for a Convention.
That cannot have been easy for you either.
Agreement and disagreement cross political divides.
Thank you, Mrs Garaud.
I do not want to add anything else.
European Council/Belgian Presidency
No issues were dodged.
That is the challenge facing us next year.
Two Member States were unable to accept it.
(Applause)
We did not shy away from that discussion.
But what are we actually doing about it?
Everything is interlinked.
One thing must be clear from now on.
Our task is merely to adapt and strengthen it.
(Laughter)
This will all have to be negotiated.
(Applause)
We have a great responsibility.
We must be able to take risks.
I salute and thank you for that.
There has been an extraordinary change in mood.
The Convention method is a defining method.
But so be it.
(Applause)
I shall now turn to the Laeken Declaration.
You mentioned your six-month Presidency.
Do not be overly disappointed.
And combating terrorism became a fundamental theme.
This is something I want to make very clear.
We have not succeeded.
(Applause)
It is also open to contributions from social players.
The same applies to enlargement.
I fully agree with this political sentiment.
I support the European Union.
The difficulty of this task should not be underestimated.
I disagree with you, Mr Lannoye.
I would also like to thank our President.
The Laeken Declaration contains more than sixty non-rhetorical questions.
Thank you for this.
Three men of a certain age.
For me that sends the wrong signals.
Thirdly, we must make progress on better regulation.
It is certainly unprecedented.
Thank you for the 60 questions or so.
Frankly, I would have wished for more.
We will exploit that freedom.
You posed the right questions at the Convention.
Unfortunately, the objectives appear to remain fixed.
Why?
Finally let me turn to the Declaration itself.
These options represent the wrong route for Europe.
That word is 'woman' .
We will count them when the time has come.
Why not?
You outlined a dream a moment ago.
The first concerns the Convention.
Secondly, the membership of the praesidium.
That praise, I think, is due.
Where are the critics?
Where are the critics?
Not a significant one, I fear.
The Convention will be relying on quality.
What caused this to happen?
These are the two reasons.
We must not overlook this.
It is towards that goal that it must work.
This has acquired an added dimension since 11 September.
(Applause)
There is another European Union-Canada Summit.
There should not be a common link.
This mechanism is now being discontinued.
It is actually quite simple.
This is also what will actually happen.
I would say, 'why?'
'Because the answer is implied in the question' .
The same number will represent the national parliaments.
It must be prepared.
I sometimes hear people say that federalism spells disaster.
Quite the opposite.
(Applause)
We have left a black hole in the Balkans.
It is unacceptable and I should like an answer.
On the contrary, they constitute the very problem.
What is Europe for?
What are its competences?
We can do that using the existing Treaties.
A constituent assembly would have been more appropriate.
That is a good thing.
The same speaker spoke of a lack of democracy.
(Protests from Mr Swoboda)
There are national parliaments for that.
Each institution has its place.
We must clearly take this into account.
We must also be careful in this respect.
Of course, I respect the American model.
It is not desirable to transpose it.
Many questions have concerned the Convention.
This is of no small importance.
I am thinking in particular of young people.
This is another way to use this Convention.
This is a start.
There has been mention of a social deficit.
I believe that this is of importance.
Think also of the European social conciliator.
This is a fundamentally important element.
Unfortunately I cannot stay here much longer.
A new era was begun at Laeken.
We are delighted.
But there is still a long way to go.
We must therefore continue with our efforts.
I would question the validity of continuing this debate.
Whom are we actually addressing?
This requires a multilateral approach.
We are on the right track.
These two points completely dominated the Dutch media.
Luckily, these are very broadly based.
This is a very fine initial package.
This could be done by the European Parliament.
Each Member State will redefine its own fiscal policy.
Deadlock is still assured.
This represents a great opportunity.
On balance it is a very positive one.
We therefore congratulate the Belgian Presidency, Mr President.
On all that we can be pleased.
That too can be used to learn some lessons.
Thank you very much.
This is the weapon of the sceptics and populists.
What should we do?
Is there no way forward?
I believe we should welcome this.
The Laeken Summit has decided to create the Convention.
Good luck - the work will not be easy!
I hope not.
Do not run before you can walk.
I wish you a happy Christmas.
Let us take, for example, common suffrage.
No women were even shortlisted for the presidency.
I believe we have missed an opportunity here.
We must never forget that.
However, that did not happen.
The Convention mandate allows us to do this.
What do we want to do together?
The debate is closed.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
(Loud applause)
Order of business
Announcement of candidates for election of President
Mr Bonde
Mr Cox
Mr David Martin
Mr Onesta
Mr Wurtz
(The President drew lots to select the tellers)
(The sitting was closed at 6.14 p.m.)
Election of President of Parliament
Mr Bonde,
Mr Cox,
Mr David W. Martin,
Mr Onesta and
Mr Wurtz.
Good morning colleagues.
This Parliament must continue to be multilingual.
Eleven languages make 110 combinations.
Twenty-two languages make 462 combinations.
Thirty-five languages make 1 090 combinations.
Our buildings are not prepared for that.
We risk a Babel-like confusion.
How we vote today is part of that responsibility.
We would then be bad MEPs.
Leave it to the committees to prepare the votes.
Let the plenary deal with the important political issues.
Leave one-third of the speaking time for real debates.
They share the information.
Does "common" really mean "unilateral"?
I have been here for 22 years.
Fifteen percent are settled by the ambassadors.
Our next President should re-establish democracy.
Give yourself a better choice.
The next chair will have a real mandate.
He deserves our full support.
But we must continue to try.
We are 626 Members, we are a Parliament.
I ask you for your support.
But no parliament can work in the dark.
Thirty months is a short time.
We need a President for all of Parliament.
(Loud applause)
So, we say yes to reforms.
I believe this dream to be a realistic one.
Let us now discuss pluralism and equality.
I shall now turn to openness.
Thank you, Mrs Nicole Fontaine.
It is this approach that my candidacy illustrates.
We must take action.
Both represent a part of the real Europe.
That is another characteristic of my candidacy.
You have been given ballot papers and envelopes.
I will not call out your names.
I will simply declare the vote open and closed.
I declare the vote open.
Voters: 590.
Blank or spoilt ballots: 7.
Votes cast: 583.
Absolute majority: 292.
Mr Bonde: 66 votes
Mr Cox: 254 votes
Mr David Martin: 184 votes
Mr Onesta: 37 votes
Mr Wurtz: 42 votes.
We shall therefore proceed to a second vote.
The ballot papers and their envelopes will be distributed.
I declare the vote open.
Voters: 592.
Blank or spoilt ballot papers: 13.
Votes cast: 579.
Absolute majority: 290.
Mr Bonde: 76 votes
Mr Cox: 277 votes
Mr David Martin: 226 votes
Mr Cox wishes to do so.
So does Mr David Martin.
Does Mr Bonde wish to continue?
(Parliament voted in favour of suspending the sitting)
I have received the following nominations:
Mr Bonde
Mr Cox
Mr David Martin
We shall therefore proceed to a third vote.
The ballot papers and their envelopes are being distributed.
I declare the vote open.
Voters: 586.
Blank or spoilt ballot papers: 18.
Votes cast: 568.
Absolute majority: 285.
The results are as follows:
Mr Bonde: 33 votes
Mr Cox: 298 votes
Mr David Martin: 237 votes.
I call on Mr Cox to take the Chair.
(Loud applause)
It feels very different to be here.
That is politics and democracy.
I thank you for it.
He has brought that too.
I thank my colleagues in the ELDR Group.
(Applause)
I thank all those who voted for me.
I thank you and salute you for it.
(Applause)
I shall now speak briefly in Irish.
Why do I do this?
Irish is my native tongue.
(Applause)
My friends, thank you for this extraordinary privilege.
(Applause)
(Applause)
This, I believe, is the message today.
(Applause)
Allow me to say a final word.
Mr President, this continent was divided.
Trust too is important in politics.
(Applause)
Why?
Because we have affirmed our common values.
They are going to be members of the Convention.
We have to develop our relationship with them.
We are now talking about an enlarged Union.
I had none prepared, Mr President.
It was delightful to see him here.
I offer you my warmest congratulations.
It is a victory that was well deserved.
You had to campaign hard for it.
You did so.
I look forward to working with you.
I look forward to working with you.
I have spoken to every group in this House.
I have spoken to committees and intergroups.
That is democracy in action.
(Applause)
I wish you well.
I am looking forward to it!
(Laughter and sustained applause)
(Laughter)
I think that you have illustrated this wonderfully.
I shall try.
And we are democrats.
You are now a President for everyone.
We would like to congratulate you, of course.
You are now everyone' s President.
We have taken note of this as well.
We are counting on you to do this.
Thank you Mr Pasqua.
You too, Mr Pasqua.
That is your task as President.
Mr President, you did it!
It was wonderful.
You had a dream and you succeeded.
Fortunately you have more dreams, more visions.
I am sure you will succeed again.
We are so proud of you.
We will miss you.
But fortunately you will stay among us.
All the best.
I miss you desperately!
Our friendships have not been weakened but been strengthened.
Dear Mr Cox, congratulations on your victory.
You gained the majority in a secret vote.
You are no longer the result of a deal.
You have a clear mandate from the House.
Congratulations.
I have just one comment to make.
That brings us to the next order of business.
We now must elect the Vice-Presidents of Parliament.
It is 5.30 p.m.
I hope you are in agreement.
The sitting is suspended.
Election of Vice-Presidents of Parliament
(Loud applause)
...
(Loud applause)
Mr President, I have a question.
It is your preference.
There is no rule on the matter.
We now proceed to the vote.
The result will be announced tomorrow.
(The sitting was closed at 7.28 p.m.)
Election of Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament
The votes were cast as follows:
Mr Martin: 300 votes.
Congratulations, David.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos: 240 votes.
(Applause)
Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld: 230 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Imbeni: 226 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca: 215 votes.
(Applause)
Mr PodestÃ : 203 votes.
(Applause)

(Applause)
Mr Pacheco Pereira: 164 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Provan: 162 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Schmid, Gerhard: 151 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Onesta: 148 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Puerta: 120 votes.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Douze points!
We will have that corrected in the Minutes.
Are there any further comments?
(Parliament approved the minutes of the previous sittings)
Order of business
Mr President, on a point of order.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I shall communicate that to you and to colleagues.
It offends my national sentiment and feeling for history.
Thank you, Mr Thors.
I also think that this situation is absolutely intolerable.
Thank you, Mr Dupuis.
Decision on urgent procedure
(The request for urgency was rejected)
Election of Quaestors of Parliament
Given the circumstances, I think this is regrettable.
I would recommend...
(Mixed reactions)
I take note of that.
Mr President, my machine is not working.
Let us sort out Mr Berthu's machine.
Mr President, that is not the problem.
(Loud applause)
We know the essential point at issue.
(Parliament agreed to vote electronically) President.
The next item is the election of the Quaestors.
We are now in the middle of the vote.
(The vote was taken).
There were 534 votes.
There was one blank ballot and 533 valid votes.
The majority is 267.
The results for candidates are as follows:
Banotti: 369
Quisthoudt-Rowohl: 299
Balfe: 259
Smet: 254
Poos: 221
Marinho: 189
Maes: 125
That is what was foreseen in the agenda.
Mr President, on a point of order.
We should vote openly by a show of hands.
That is my first point.
I think that this is what everyone wants.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I do not wish to delay matters.
What Mr Dell'Alba has said is absolutely right.
We have spent far too long voting this week.
It is quite simple.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I want to be clear on this.
We should proceed electronically as we began.
Spanish Presidency programme
Thank you very much for your attention.
(Applause)
We have achieved monetary union.
First, employment.
Europe needs an active employment policy.
Second, reform, and completing the internal market.
We need to connect Europe and its markets.
These industries are the backbone of our economy.
Third, education, training and research.
Our group warmly welcomes you to Parliament.
We must defend human dignity throughout the world.
(Applause)
I congratulate you on your choice of him.
So let there be restructuring of the budget!
We strongly support you in the Mediterranean dialogue.
We wish you every success on your way.
(Applause)
It did so before 11 September.
Secondly, I will mention the euro.
I think it is right to acknowledge this.
There must be rules to protect citizens and consumers.
We share your concern.
We have been fighting for it for many years.
You are perfect hosts.
Is it a cause for amendment?
Centralising what?
The media?
A final word on governance and codecision.
We have yet to debate the Lamfalussy procedure.
I should like to keep on schedule.
Mr President!
Your programme speaks of a war against terrorism.
We recognise that.
A list of priorities soon becomes a universal catalogue.
Each Member State brings something different to the party.
We will follow development in this matter closely.
(Applause)
In fact, the opposite is true.
(Applause)
Otherwise, enlargement will not be possible in 2004.
The problem will be what to do next.
There is no place for terrorism in this area.
I strongly support this political objective.
Bienvenido.
Thank you Mr President.
Time is running out.
You must hurry up.
You spoke like a Spanish Socialist.
There will never ever be disloyalty from our side.
Others may show some.
In our view, this would mean more Europe.
We note the lack of concrete commitments.
What do you mean by more Europe?
More Europe means more employment but also less inequality.
More Europe means more democracy and more participation.
Reflect the reality of Spain in Europe.
Do not try to hide it, Mr Aznar.
The autonomous communities are also States.
Take that political and social reality further.
Include it in your Presidency.
There is another point I would like to make.
This will require two things.
And it requires ambition.
Today, it is a reality.
It is a prerequisite for peace and progress.
His saying that is wholly unacceptable.
We would be very grateful if it did.
We do not think like that.
The presidency faces similar challenges on the economic front.
We simply cannot afford continued failure.
Europe has to get it right.
Since Stockholm things have in fact moved backwards.
This is a job-destroying agenda.
Italy has already been mentioned today.
We often turn a blind eye to this.
What is the net effect on employment and wages?
Why is it not invoked?
I will return to that in a moment.
Allow me to finish in Catalan...
...
Visca Catalunya lliure!
[Long live a free Catalonia!]
Visca Europa unida!
[Long live a united Europe!]
We have misgivings about your approach.
These are fundamental to an open market.
A rushed and ill-considered liberalisation would be highly dangerous.
Renewable energies in particular need legal protection and promotion.
Unlike Mr Evans, we think that is important.
It is as if the navigation charts have disappeared.
I could not agree more.
I would like to endorse that too.
The care sector and public transport spring to mind.
Enlargement has now entered a crucial phase.
Good luck in what you intend!
Two major events have occurred.
The Spanish Presidency is facing these two challenges.
Its reform cannot ignore this reality.
You mentioned the Monterrey International Conference.
Who is to fund them?
The Stability Pact must be respected.
This opportunity is evident in various situations.
I say this for various reasons.
They are right.
How can this be done?
But we have to discuss such matters.
I am sorry to interrupt, Prime Minister.
This is clearly the path we need to take.
A challenge to do what?
The challenge to realise the objective of full employment.
This is why we are discussing education and employment.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Thank you, President-in-Office of the Council.
Vote
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the decision)
(Parliament adopted the decision)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament approved the common position)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
- Temporary committee on foot-and-mouth disease
.
Election of Quaestors of Parliament
Voting: 570, valid votes: 567.
Majority: 284.
Mr Poos: 304 - elected
Mr Balfe: 288 - elected
Mrs Smet: 288 - elected
Mr Marinho: 264
Mrs Maes: 116.
No further votes are required.
We have filled all five positions for Quaestor.
I congratulate all the individuals who have been elected.
I invite you to a brief reception.
Welcome
You are very welcome, Vladimir.
I should not say these things from the chair.
Introduction of the euro
Our most optimistic expectations have been more than satisfied.
This course of action has been a success.
Moving ahead also means facing up to new challenges.
Thank you, Commissioner.
You have our congratulations and respect for doing that.
Let me here list three conditions.
Thirdly, we must move forward to political union.
We must stay consistent on this point.
(Applause)
So let us act on that basis.
Thank you.
And what an acquaintance that was.
Shopkeepers should also be praised.
But now the problem of counterfeiting has surfaced.
Next summer, these notes will be everywhere.
The Europeans did not need long changeover periods.
We must now take an important next step.
The euro must remain a stable and strong currency.
Nothing has really worked as planned.
In our view, these comments are excessive.
There is the rub, Mr President.
Is Europe prepared to accept this super-State?
No, it is not!
So far so good, with little inflationary rounding-up.
Is the euro the beginning of economic government?
This is our model.
Have businesses played the role of the bankers?
No, they have not.
Have there been serious problems of counterfeiting?
There have been photocopies.
There have indeed been practical problems.
The debate is closed.
Procurement
.
It has been proposed to increase this value.
Another major issue is environmental and social concerns.
These changes are significant.
We must not leave ourselves open to that reproach.
That is in the text as well.
There are, though, exceptions to every rule.
That smashes the Internal Market to bits.
For that you have my gratitude.
The economic advantage must unambiguously be the principal's.
There is a lot left to be desired.
My last point concerning the qualitative selection criteria.
This is something we must be very careful of.
They no longer fulfil their purpose.
People's justifiable desires and interests are neglected.
That is something this Parliament must not permit.
Let me give an example.
Nor does the Commission take that view.
Who can best take that decision?
Is it best taken in Brussels?
Is it best taken in Strasbourg by this Parliament?
Is it best taken in London?
It must be open and transparent.
It employs 80 people.
Every morning it logs on to the Official Journal.
It is perfectly entitled to apply for a contract.
Why should that be otherwise?
Why should it have to do anything else?
This is primarily an economic instrument.
That is fine.
This seems to be the most extraordinary debate.
What sort of world are we living in?
We want to oblige them to do that.
We should not do it.
There are lots of opportunities here.
Mr President, my warmest congratulations on your election.
No!
Mr Hager has shown that very clearly.
1 is the best in economic terms, no.
2 is worse, no.
3 is even worse than that and no.
Accordingly, the Commission cannot accept the following amendments:
Accordingly, the Commission cannot accept the following:
Thank you for your comprehensive explanation.
However, those conclusions cannot prejudge the judgment itself.
Your responses will then be conveyed to Mr Lehne.
The Commission awaits the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, I shall try to be brief.
There is still some misunderstanding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Ozone in ambient air
Scrooge sat in his counting house, he wrote.
We have strengthened the public's right to information.
But this misunderstands the nature of ozone pollution.
It is hugely transboundary.
But it is not appropriate now.
We can be proud of what we have achieved.
In fact, it does the complete opposite.
A reference point was set for 2020.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Sixth Community Environment Action Programme
The proposal is highly important, Mr President.
I would also like to talk about principles.
The results, however, should be the same.
There is no reason for rejecting this document.
We must adopt it today.
Any satisfaction or progress?
No, unfortunately, neither.
Can this be justified to the European citizen?
They set great store by the environment.
So what should have been done instead?
That is a proposal which we cannot support.
The original proposal was extremely weak and also vague.
We must not pass up that opportunity.
We must put this proposal in its context.
This concerns the European Investment Bank.
So what does the rapporteur want?
Let us remain realistic and pragmatic.
It does not.
Do we need a Sixth Environmental Action Programme?
I have to be honest.
But it is still not too late.
The Council's wording strikes me as too weak.
There are possibilities there for very effective savings.
I therefore emphatically support the idea of reducing subsidies.
That is why there are various proposals for compromise.
It has been extremely instructive.
That is something we must get to grips with.
The environmental action programme is challenging.
I cannot however accept the other amendments tabled.
Thank you for an interesting debate.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Integrated product policy
They can be both voluntary and mandatory.
This is what we have learnt from this discussion.
This is also what Mrs Paulsen referred to.
These tools will still be important.
Thank you, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Europe and Space
I must say that I personally am against this.
Industry, too, should break new ground here.
The Socialist Group will be supporting the report.
Europe cannot afford to be sidelined.
That is an important way ahead.
We should take careful note of that.
That is very important to emphasise.
'Tackle it!' must be our watchword.
A political signal is indispensable.
I emphatically support the proposed lines of action.
Europe must accord space travel more importance in future.
Space travel should be given new impetus.
We can make outer space a space for peace.
That would be devastating.
That would be Pharisaical!
This must be the main goal of the Union.
My speech will focus on three points.
The third aspect concerns the future.
The answer is, a great deal.
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Road Transport
This amendment too was accepted.
Parliament has backed this initiative at first reading.
Both the Council and Parliament agree on this.
The same philosophy applied to the training objectives.
The objective is that training should be equal.
I am grateful to them for their work.
We will be voting accordingly.
Mr Hatzidakis, this was a technical amendment.
Consequently, few political points can be scored.
The advantages here are obvious even to the layman.
This, too, is an important matter.
Account is taken of this in the report.
Participation in training must be as flexible as possible.
The safety of road transport must also be improved.
Here is a crucial example.
That cannot be what the originator had in mind.
But we are inviting worse than ridicule.
For benefits which at best are vague and speculative.
I urge colleagues to reject the Grosch report.
Just 5%.
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
ACP/EC Partnership Agreement
The Cotonou Agreement is not groundbreaking.
But can the ACP countries contend with global competition?
Biodiversity is under threat.
But it has no binding instrument to do this.
Political dialogue is another essential element.
It must also be reciprocal and effectively implemented.
But who will define the performance criteria?
Which form of policy comes first may be immaterial.
It is now our task to pursue such development.
The same applies to our continuing work in Kosovo.
I am much more optimistic than the rapporteur.
I believe the Cotonou Accord is the right path.
LomÃ© had its faults.
The theme of poverty alleviation must be right.
The only question is how best to implement it.
Should we be using multilateral aid or bilateral aid?
I do not believe that project aid has failed.
All these are elements that should strengthen the partnership.
This is Parliament's fault.
This partnership has to work.
Unfortunately, things are not as simple as that.
Would Commissioner Nielsen agree with me on this?
I share his concerns on this.
We must also have instruments of political cooperation.
It is right to stress this point again tonight.
The way we obtained it was through real negotiations.
This is what experience tells us.
This is not sufficiently reflected in the report.
This is a classical case.
This is not the case.
Both are highly relevant for LDCs.
There are real problems there.
The Commission disagrees with that statement.
This is why we do it.
We welcome this conclusion.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
There are no comments.
(The Minutes were approved)
We need to be preparing smart sanctions now.
There are other possibilities.
Mr President, on a point of order.
In this Parliament yesterday the British Socialists ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you.
Future of the common fisheries policy
I have a feeling that it is not.
.
We must therefore act to eliminate this contradiction.
The subject is simply too important.
Fisheries swam through many a trough.
One thing, though, must be clear.
We owe this to our taxpayers.
When they cannot fish, they do not eat.
Reform is essential.
Without fish there can be no fishing industry.
This has created conflicts.
I withdrew.
This is as it should be.
We are totally opposed to this.
We believe in the future of the fishing industry.
Why do I consider the report to be unsatisfactory?
I shall refer to two key issues.
Any other policy would be absurd.
I stress the word "management".
(The President cut the speaker off)
Those are the deplorable facts.
We all know which issues remain unresolved.
Secondly, we need more imaginative solutions.
That is why we need regionalisation.
These two objectives are shared by all.
My last point concerns penalties.
Can we achieve a proper balance?
Would renationalisation mean any more fish?
I do not think so.
Would it mean more financial support?
So we have to find an acceptable position.
We have an opportunity to get it right.
It is a task that seemed almost insurmountable.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Stocks of cod and hake
But we do.
The Commission's own words are telling.
I should like to wish the Commissioner well.
Long may this continue.
Scientific advice for many years has been stark.
Thirdly, new monitoring measures have been proposed.
Even today the cod have not returned.
However, there are other factors at play.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Environmental Protection Requirements and the Common Fisheries Policy
We therefore welcome this Commission communication.
This also endangers fishing.
The Verts/ALE Group cannot support it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Vote
You have a rookie in the Chair.
I intend to do that myself.
(Parliament approved the proposals)
(Parliament approved the joint text)
(The President declared the common position approved)
(The President declared the common position approved)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
It augurs well.
(Applause)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
We will continue with the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Only a dream, of course, Madam President!
Why is that?
That is why I voted for the motion.
.
'Fine!'
I therefore hope Mr Fatuzzo will support it.'
Both the remuneration and the working conditions are unacceptable.
ZappalÃ  report (A5-0378/2001)
That is why we voted against the ZappalÃ  report.
The latter would make authorities dependent on companies.
This creates a monopoly, in fact.
There are two conflicting theories, therefore:
ZappalÃ  report (A5-0379/2001)
That is why we voted against the report.
Grosch report (A5-0430/2001)
We abstained from voting on this report.
The report blames the 'current economic climate' .
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
Rod report (A5-0412/2001)
.
This is for various reasons.
1.
2.
3.
GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen Tormo report (A5-0419/2001)
How could we not support it?
Alyssandrakis report (A5-0451/2001)
.
We therefore voted against this report.
That is why I reject the proposal.
MiguÃ©lez Ramos report (A5-0470/2001)
Aren' t there any fish?'
.
Hudghton report (A5-0458/2001)
The proposed measures are therefore not the right ones.
Lavarra report (A5-0457/2001)
Bon apÃ©tit!
.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Mutual recognition of financial penalties
We will soon be agreed on this.
The proposal is quite simply designed.
I doubt whether that is true.
Confidence cannot be enforced from above by harmonising legislation.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
Training and recruitment of seafarers
This is caused mainly by two factors.
These accidents are mostly caused by human error.
That is something that we both regret.
The communication proposes various recommendations.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
Leonardo da Vinci programme (1995-1999)
What is going on?
Did this happen or not?
And for us then to decide.
We must therefore proceed in this way.
Please stick to the rules of fair play.
Basle II
Our question today is prompted by our economic structure.
This means applying a partial use approach.
I will say more about this in a moment.
The target date for implementation is 2005.
This matter is still being considered in Basle.
The Commission regards this approach as useful and effective.
I welcome a risk-sensitive framework.
It is vital that we get this right.
Many things can be cloaked in modernism.
Such models are very costly and hard to control.
There are two points still outstanding.
The second thing that interests me is this.
After all, we cannot all take part.
It will be a very rapid process.
I should like to make three points.
I mentioned the global framework.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
Vote
I voted for the motion, Mr President.
Kauppi report (A5-0450/2001)
.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 5.10 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
I hope that this can be rectified.
Yes, indeed, Mr Pronk.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
Announcement by the President
The deadline for implementing that request was today.
I believe we can build on it.
Mr President, I totally agree with your decision.
I also have something to say to the Commission.
That is what we expect tomorrow.
(Applause)
Procedural remarks
(The President cut the speaker off)
We shall communicate that as you request.
This applies not only in Member States ...
Drug trafficking
These issues are all far too ambitious.
I would now like to turn to the amendments.
This is rather forced in my opinion.
Today, the waters are somewhat calmer.
In general, I think he has succeeded.
However, I am not so certain.
After all, the elections are in the offing.
Drugs like heroin and crack cocaine are okay?
I do not accept that.
Who in fact makes the profit?
We must know who they are.
They must be tackled.
I thank him for his efforts in this respect.
This is a policy that we obviously cannot harmonise.
The Commission should not be getting involved in this.
However, this is where our paths diverge.
That is the sole purpose of this proposal.
What have we done wrong?
Third-country nationals
It is only adding an EU dimension.
I will return to the UK position later.
Other measures would in addition enhance social integration.
The text is framed in sufficiently definite terms.
We must, then, put down markers.
This is a balanced proposal.
Why is this?
Everyone would like to have suitable housing.
It is a balanced approach.
This is a momentous issue for Europe.
It thus excludes all those living here illegally.
I have a couple of comments, however.
My apologies also to Baroness Ludford.
That is perpetuating a second-class citizen status.
We must have things sorted out by then.
We ask Parliament not to approve it.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Relief, rehabilitation and development
Allow me to illustrate this with a textbook example.
The existing rehabilitation regulation is too restricted.
The entire donor community is responsible for improvement.
This is tragic.
Is this opportunism, accurate evidence or over-reacting?
It is almost impossible to plan for natural disasters.
, Commission.
The figures speak for themselves.
The speakers this evening also referred to this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
Workers' rights
The next item is the joint debate on:
We now have a total reversal of that situation.
Neither of those things is very likely to happen.
That is an extremely useful definition.
I will make three quick points regarding that.
Most delegations were against.
But Kralowetz makes two things glaringly obvious.
It is not the only example.
This should all be improved.
This is a good result, in my view.
Historic steps are being taken in both areas.
The Commission issued a document on this subject recently.
Some governments are aware of this situation.
The rewards in this industry are quite low.
That led to this drivers' attestation directive.
There was no participation there either.
We have a constructive compromise before us.
What was possible has now been done.
It is of historic importance.
Three women have been involved.
I can add a fourth.
Well now, that is true.
Firstly, the controls must be tightened up.
I congratulate them for their skill.
Politics is certainly an odd business.
It is also a European phenomenon.
That is the situation we face.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is the situation we are living in.
(The President cut the speaker off.)
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Energy performance of buildings
I wanted to stress three aspects of the directive.
So I have tabled amendments to that effect.
We should now proceed to give it teeth.
Are we trying to save energy?
These are not all the same things.
We are a long way from solving that one.
Therefore you cannot compare them very easily.
But it is a step in the right direction.
What we are now discussing is energy efficiency.
It also has a very large cost-effective savings potential.
That is where the real potential for improvement lies.
Mr Adam mentioned Amendment No 15.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon..
(The sitting was closed at 8.50 p.m.)
Announcement by the President
EIB Annual Report for 2000
It made the work considerably easier.
I also wish to thank my colleagues.
Now it is also Russia' s turn.
There are clear opportunities for growth in this area.
I agree with that.
It is mainly about the economic supervision of companies.
I think that this criticism has been justified.
There is a need to go further, however.
This should mean a big improvement.
SMEs ensure growth and employment in Europe.
We must not stop the support measures.
One final plea, Mr President.
There must be changes here.
The Bank has already implemented the Lisbon initiatives.
I would like to make two further comments.
The European Investment Bank is not a commercial bank.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon.
Financial services legislation
We have reached a fair and honourable compromise.
Let us, together, seize the moment.
This concludes my preliminary remarks.
What, then, is this debate about?
That proposal is a very good one.
Where, then, is the problem?
What have we achieved?
Transparency first of all.
We also get to see preliminary drafts.
You are aware of this, Mr Prodi.
Congratulations, Mr Prodi and Mr von Wogau.
Congratulations to all of you.
That is also very important.
Mr Corbett, your request has been anticipated.
But there has been a key problem.
We needed guarantees of transparency, openness and consultation.
The Lisbon reform process is back on track.
This to me typifies what the Community is about.
The time factor is crucial.
The Italian radicals will therefore vote for the measure.
The Lamfalussy report should be seen in that context.
Mr Corbett has also done so.
Obviously, equivalence with the Council.
The Commission is well aware of that.
Mr Titford said that the industry would collapse.
Methinks this is a poetic exaggeration.
The Commission congratulates him.
Those remarks will be Minuted.
They cover the issue that has been referred to.
We in Parliament have taken a pragmatic approach.
.
Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
That had previously been a matter for the Commission.
That is a success in which we all share.
That is, without a doubt, very important.
We shall pay attention to that.
This was, fortunately, clear today.
I disagree very strongly with that view.
That is not so.
In other words, everybody must fulfil their responsibilities.
Thank you, Karl.
That is why we are so sceptical.
Now for my last point.
Equal with whom and equal to what?
So far, so good!
Mr President, who are you trying to fool?
And what are we doing today?
The third problem is the insecurity of investors.
This must not be allowed to happen in Europe.
That is perfectly correct.
There again the Commission wholeheartedly agrees.
I should like to address Mr Goebbels' comments.
The Commission does show respect for Parliament's resolutions.
What more can Mr Goebbels want?
It has more respect for the agreed comitology procedure.
So matters have basically remained the same.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon.
Structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco
We would like to further reinforce this aspect.
Otherwise it would surely have happened by now.
Congratulations, Mr Katiforis.
Secondly, the goal of combating fraud and smuggling.
That is a tragedy.
Smoking is therefore very much a public health issue.
This time, Mr Katiforis is wrong.
However, this does not need to be re-emphasised.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Mr Corrie, your point is well made.
Your suggestion is one possibility.
Conversations are for outdoors.
Vote
The next item is the vote.
(The President declared the common position adopted)
Simplified procedure:

My delegation welcomes the adoption of the directive.
That is a problem.

The Union must therefore shoulder its responsibilities.
Home, sweet home!
Rapport Kessler (A5-0455/2001)
Rapport Katiforis (A5-0016/2002)
I share the concern about the less privileged regions.
Rapport Van den Berg (A5-0464/2001)
Why is that?
Rapport Olle Schmidt (A5-0392/2001)
Report Von Wogau (A5-0011/2002)
Europe is drawing closer to them.
My heartiest congratulations!
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Situation in the Middle East
Should we be pessimistic then?
What can we do from now on?
How can we try to resolve the situation?
I believe that these visits have some consequences.
We can and must continue to fight against violence.
That was the spirit of the Mitchell report.
That is where we stand, ladies and gentlemen.
I have a little bit of hope.
I cannot say that there is a lot.
What political initiatives can we bring to the table?
This is the idea we are working on.
I cannot guarantee success.
There is no other solution.
Will we have success immediately?
There is no guarantee of that.
Yes.
I can assure you that there is.
It is therefore our obligation to continue doing it.
The first is Afghanistan.
Thirteen European Union countries have forces deployed there.
The present government has a certain degree of balance.
Firstly, Pakistan.
I believe that we must work with them.
And thirdly, Russia.
We are therefore moving in the right direction.
We will win this battle.
(Applause)
I wish you well for a very successful presidency.
(Applause)
Again, why?
We know they are true from our experience.
(Applause)
(Applause)
No, we are not anti-Semitic.
In that, we stand alongside all Israelis.
This has absolutely nothing to do with anti-Semitism.
(Applause)
We urge Arafat to provide information on this.
All this we welcome.
(Applause)
I agree with you wholeheartedly.
He is the only person we can negotiate with.
Where, though, does it get us?
High Representative, you spoke also about Afghanistan.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Mr Sakellariou will say 'Europe means nothing.
No one listens to us.'
This is why we must not give up.
He is as hypocritical as Mr Sharon.
That is not the problem.
It is not a question of moral standards.
There is a second - Mr Sharon.
Nothing can be done.
We have to put up with the situation.
We must therefore make ourselves heard.
What do we think of this?
Welcome
Situation in the Middle East (continued)
There are two indications of this.
This will benefit the Israelis and Palestinians alike.
That is the reality today.
This proposal has been put forward.
I too nurture some small hope.
The young Israelis said: 'We want peace.
We are the other Israel' .
And Mr Arafat embraced them.
However, this is no longer 1967.
Only then can peace return to the Middle East.
So we shuttle hither and thither and get nowhere.
Thank you, Mr President.
Bloodshed leads to further bloodshed.
How can he do this?
We share your frustration at the lack of outcomes.
High Representative Solana mentioned the Islamic Republic of Iran.
My view is his as well.
Current Israeli policy is ludicrous and counterproductive.
Who do they want to replace him with?
I am referring to Zimbabwe.
I have some questions for Mr Solana.
What can the European Union do?
What is the EU' s reaction to this?
Are we Europeans merely bystanders here?
No, we are not.
And then we have another crisis within Europe.
The Balkan crisis.
Frequently that is not the case in these debates.
But what happens?
Therefore, you are back to square one.
That has happened on a couple of occasions.
I have not received many questions.
They work together every day.
We need to be tenacious and persevering.
Israel has changed.
The same thing has happened on the other side.
That has disappeared.
Therefore we have to work also with societies.
That is something we have to do.
He used to say something that is still valid.
This is not a question only of values.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
We will talk about that in the appropriate forum.
Vertical agreements and concerted practices in the automobile industry
What are the main characteristics?
Then consumers are demanding multi-brand dealerships.
The draft regulation makes multi-brand selling much more simple.
The whole process should be concluded before next summer.
That is something I welcome.
Such is my first important question in this context.
There is one question I have to ask.
I should like to raise two points with him.
My question is the same as Mrs Riis-JÃ¸rgensen's.
That would have two main drawbacks.
This is clearly something which could not be accepted.
I would like to make some comments.
I would stress the following, however.
There is an injection of additional competition.
I will be brief.
I want to welcome the announcement by the Commissioner.
Generally we have post-tax prices advertised.
In this area some action concerning taxation is important.
The Commission has a role to play in this.
They would face constraints in doing so.
I believe not - on the contrary.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
Question No 39 by (H-0030/02):
What has been done about reactors 5 and 6?
You must be a very happy man.
What happens to the contaminated materials?
Who pays for it all?
How long does such decommissioning take?
Who pays then?
Who bears the costs?
Should we perhaps not make that 2004 or 2003?
What happens then if something goes wrong in 2005?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Part II Questions to Commissioner Liikanen
Question No 41 by (H-0054/02):
What steps is the Commission taking to that end?
The evaluation was last carried out in April.
Question No 43 by (H-0042/02):
Has this idea worked?
I think it has.
Internet penetration has increased.
Today 90% of European enterprises have Internet access.
A comprehensive overview is now available.
It was accepted today in the Commission.
What are the new challenges?
We must have more PCs at school per student.
Business consumer e-commerce is still rather small.
Governments have started enthusiastically to go on-line.
Real interactivity is still rare.
Broadband Internet is now a real option.
Without broadband we will not deliver fully Lisbon.
Other nations have already made their choices for broadband.
New technologies like digital rights management are helpful there.
What does the Commission intend to do about this?
How do you intend to tackle this?
All these issues are extremely important.
I have just a few remarks.
Schools are well placed to bridge the digital divide.
Through them we can guarantee education for all.
In Europe comprehensive school systems still work.
We can guarantee skills for everybody.
Should that be a solution?
It brings together different operators from different Member States.
The Commission supports these efforts.
What effect will that have on digital television licences?
Thank you very much for your cooperation, Commissioner.
Questions to Commissioner Diamantopoulou
Question No 44 by (H-0951/01):
Ireland and Greece are both cohesion countries.
First, may I thank you for your support.
Question No 45 by (H-0008/02):
Question No 46 by (H-0035/02):
What progress has been made?
Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
Nowhere.
Question No 47 by (H-0015/02):
There were many discussions over many years.
There were many disagreements between the Member States.
This is totally unacceptable.
Questions to Commissioner Patten
Question No 52 by (H-0960/01):
The amount envisaged is EUR 24 m.
NGOs generally organise elementary hygiene education for women.
I hope there will be in the transitional administration.
However, we will do all that we can.
Question No 54 by (H-0965/01):
In conclusion, work is well in hand.
I thank the Commissioner for his answer.
It is a pleasure to work with Dr Buseck.
Question No 55 by (H-0002/02):
I am glad he has not repeated that tonight.
Give us some hope that it will happen.
So we are making progress.
Subject: International Criminal Court
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
VAT - Direct and indirect taxation
Generally it is a matter of Carousel Fraud.
The legal situation will thus be cleared up soon.
Many thanks for that.
We Socialists also wholeheartedly support this Commission proposal.
The proposal deals with two very important matters.
It is the thin end of the wedge.
We need to eliminate formal requirements.
I thank Mrs Kauppi very much for her report.
It is extremely constructive.
It is about administrative cooperation.
It is not about changing the VAT regime.
I wish the Commission could do that.
But no, it is about administrative cooperation.
The Commission is extremely pleased with this support.
That would seriously hamper the fight against VAT fraud.
I thank Parliament for its most constructive intervention.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
State aid
But, joking aside ...
That cannot always be done.
That, then, is something I value.
As I have said, I have named them.
You will have to do some thinking about that.
Let us cut back on it a little.
There are 22 paragraphs in this report.
We have six amendments to consider tomorrow.
Let us look at the things that unite us.
We actually both believe in a competitive Europe.
We are in favour of making our economy competition-friendly.
We do not all share the same political outlook.
He has raised the issue consistently.
I should like to mention the Steel Aid Code.
This commitment must be kept to.
I see this as an extremely worrying trend.
I have nothing new to report on this.
Everything can be blamed on 11 September.
Please give us a free economy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Monitoring of BSE
Globalisation increases with every day that passes.
Experience so far is alarming, however.
Life continues, and so does its negative sides.
One can only scratch one's head in bafflement.
They are the responsibility of the Member States.
Our objective is food safety.
This is the English version.
These are the things I want to say.
I believe we need more effective checks for contamination.
It is high time that was done.
I call on Members to let common sense prevail.
The 30-month threshold currently imposed seems to be working.
Another concern is the compulsory testing of sheep.
The report's demands are indeed far-reaching.
How is it going to be processed?
Furthermore, Argentinian meat imports have started up again.
Thank you, Madam President.
We have to be very frank about this.
However, this makes no sense.
BSE is not the same as foot-and-mouth disease.
We cannot conceal our shortcomings with futile measures.
So I welcome his efforts in fighting BSE.
Moreover, consumers would find it incomprehensible.
We must make it our concern.
Just try making sense of that.
The wellbeing and health of animals must be safeguarded.
That is still the case.
I think this would give rise to unjustifiable costs.
Let me make another observation.
I want to thank him for this report.
However, the situation will remain under review.
I am insistent that there will be no complacency.
The youngest positive test was found at 41 months.
That ban is in place and will remain so.
There is no debate concerning that issue.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That was not my proposal.
Rather, it came from elsewhere.
BSE is still a problem.
That is why there is a need for research.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Climate change
This option would be environmentally dishonest and economically irrational.
It is this view that most divides us.
However, there are black sheep everywhere.
Parliament will ratify the Agreement tomorrow.
We will see similar figures tomorrow too.
We will be voting unanimously.
Three major questions remain.
First of all, there is the implementation.
This has been insisted on strongly at WTO talks.
The burden has already been shared within the EU.
Now there is talk of emissions trading.
This time, Europe is indeed ahead.
That is something that I welcome.
Some have already referred to that.
That is very important.
Thank you, Mr Moreira da Silva.
I hope that this will be possible.
Thank you for your views and for this debate.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Education and training systems
General education is broader.
This dimension is missing from the Commission communication.
There are too few teachers.
There is also insufficient funding.
There are problems in other countries too.
The same applies to education.
This is welcome.
I encourage this.
Europe can offer better education for everybody.
Parliament's report should not forget to underline that.
We need dialogue at school unit level.
And here the Commission proposal really is one-sided.
A knowledge-based society cannot be created without knowledge.
These different aspects therefore need to complement one another.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.10 a.m.)
Resumption of the sitting
Statement by the President of the European Parliament
The greatest transformation in hand of course is enlargement.
We need it and the work is excellent.
(Applause)
(Applause)
That is our business.
Our essential public purpose is to serve our citizens.
Parliament can claim an ownership of the idea.
(Applause)
These are the aims of my presidency.
(Applause)
Let me give Chechnya as a quite specific example.
This is something we cannot allow!
(Applause)
You mentioned interinstitutional balance.
We are there alongside you.
Much has been said about the Convention.
We need working procedures for the Convention.
Please permit me a concluding observation, Mr President.
(Applause)
We must keep this up.
Secondly, the Members' Statute.
First of all: governance.
Secondly, immunity.
Lastly, the Convention.
You are showing yourself to be trustworthy.
We must be politicians, not technicians.
We want to see political accountability in Europe.
It is not sufficient to organise development cooperation.
We want to maximise our role as a parliament.
We want to monitor.
A great deal of progress has been made.
Moreover, we must be given more competences.
Needless to say, the activities must be reformed.
The will to reform is there.
We must condemn creeping reforms without clear objectives.
You are moving closer to them.
We encounter them in the joint meetings.
The Convention will be the proof of the pudding.
We are putting our trust in this.
We fully support you in doing this.
How can this be achieved in practical terms?
I myself have come up with three ideas.
Then we should all face up to our responsibilities.
I mentioned three examples.
I welcome that.
They will make this Parliament more meaningful.
Let us debate the political issues.
That is important too.
They too have a role.
It did not want to answer questions.
We should not accept that.
Much reform is required within this House.
We will support that reform.
He mentioned the need for the statute.
That was not good enough then.
It will not be good enough now.
That is good, right and proper.
Let us have debate and discussion.
Are we doing Parliament justice?
Is that promoting foreign relations?
No, not in any shape or form.
Mr President, you have made a great start.
I warmly support you.
Political appointments must be a thing of the past.
The plenary sittings must be turned into lively occasions.
There cannot be special rights for specific positions.
Good luck with the reform work!
Parliament is not doing itself any service.
That is no longer the case.
The other point concerns publishing our debates.
That means a little navel-gazing.
So we have to combine the two.
It is out there that really matters to us.
The Commission presidency has also backed the idea.
We need to lock it down.
But it is right that we should.
I concur with Mr Collins.
I thank you for your contribution this morning.
Your contribution this morning was devoid of Eurospeak.
For that I warmly congratulate you.
Mr President, I shall keep it very brief.
Information more so than communication.
They are not the same.
Communication is about bringing news.
How will we deal with this?
There are countless reports on this subject.
How will we tackle this?
Why do we not hold an open debate?
Not with the intention to indoctrinate.
I wish to make three distinct observations.
Legislation must be legible despite its complexity.
Please help us to be efficient, Mr President.
The Bureau is looking at the technological aspect.
I am sure we can do that.
This has to do with Stability Pact issues.
The debate is closed.
Combating terrorism
The next item is the joint debate:
and
Nonetheless we welcome the progress it has brought.
What do these measures do?
It largely abolishes the dual incrimination principle.
It consolidates the idea of European Union law.
Currently it has been an offence in only six.
It seeks to approximate laws with common minimum penalties.
I commend these measures to the House.
The terrorist threat is deadly serious.
It requires a serious response.
These two measures constitute such a serious response.
I disagree with them.
We must respond.
This matter is very poignant to me personally.
None at all.
I agree with this.
And you need not be frightened.
They are not even referred to.
Military proceedings have been instigated.
However, I do have some concerns.
The nature of the listed offences is diverse.
They cover fraud, rape and manslaughter.
What is the cross-border aspect of these offences?
This is a very positive response.
We counter it by international cooperation.
We all abhor and condemn terrorism.
That is a really effective remedy.
They are also adequate for the time being.
We will never consider it to be enough.
I also believe that we have acted accordingly.
I am myself from Germany.
Big Brother is watching you.
This Parliament is merely consulted.
Thank you, Mr President.
Everything is now perfectly clear and established in law.
I am being very honest with you.
The message is clear.
Violence is unlawful.
(Applause)
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12.30 p.m.
I should like to list these contributions.
The rich nations must offer increased support.
We want to see practical results.
These are the bare facts.
The pledges for 2015 are clear.
It is failing, but we carry on regardless.
The European Union has a responsibility to do this.
Ladies and gentlemen, the debate is adjourned.
It will be resumed this afternoon.
I will pass on your remarks to the President.
Vote
The next item is the vote.
B5-0060/2002)
(Parliament adopted the decision)
B5-0059/2002)
(Parliament adopted the decision)
Simplified procedure:
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
and
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
and
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
After the vote on Amendment No 1:
Mr President, I share your view.
We are concerned here with three different alternatives.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report Vidal-Quadras Roca (A5-0465/2001)
Report Kauppi (A5-0466/2001)
I hope this happens as soon as possible!'
I have voted against this report.
Report Moreira da Silva (A5-0025/2002)
I totally agree, Mr President.
Report Watson (A5-0003/2002)
Unfortunately, it was not.
All this is also having further consequences.
It is basically only a political promise.
People should be extremely wary of political promises.
There is a great threat to their fundamental rights.
But this has not happened.
.
.
Report Rapkay (A5-0002/2002)
I hope this is achieved in the future.
.
Existing Community aid will, of course, continue.
This is why we have voted against the report.
Report Martens (A5-0017/2002)
Report Olsson (A5-0467/2001)
We believe that each nation must be sovereign.
.
We must automatically apply the precautionary principle.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Solidarity is part of our acquis.
I am sorry the Council is not here too.
They knew that we started at 3 p.m.
The first is the demand for development aid.
These are what are needed.
There are still other avenues to be explored.
The commitments made towards developing countries must be honoured.
That is a fundamental mistake.
This is not a short-term project.
This is on our agenda for the first time.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
President-in-Office of the Council.
The list is extensive, but not exhaustive.
Human rights considerations are involved here at several levels.
We must guard against any muddling of concepts.
Zimbabwe is the most clear example of this.
First, China.
I agree absolutely with everything the Commission has said.
Declarations are needed in these areas.
A lot of countries give considerable cause for concern.
Allow me to mention three areas.
Let there be a resolution this year.
Secondly, Zimbabwe.
Finally, Tunisia.
I shall not even mention Chechnya.
A lot has changed this year.
The Chinese must not deceive themselves.
Europe must play a leading role in this conference.
The European Union has issued deadlines and ultimata.
All of these issues are on the agenda.
This is our interpretation.
This has to be understood.
Politics never goes away.
Nothing about Zimbabwe is easy.
Relations between the EP and national parliaments
This has to be a Convention that will debate.
I think strongly there ought to be.
I shall speak to him privately about that.
The legitimacy of democratic regimes is at stake.
Mr President, we Greens especially welcome the report.
Parliamentarianism in Europe is, however, indivisible.
The problem is the preponderance of the executive.
Let us support it with our vote.
A strong European Parliament and strong national parliaments.
I therefore very much hope that this can continue.
But that is not enough.
These show the right way ahead into the future.
A clear delimitation of competences would help there.
That shows that there is something we agree on.
National parliaments must guide their Ministers in the Council.
But in what fields?
Why must we do this?
I think that this is one of our assets.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at noon.
Management of regional policy and the Structural Funds
The first is the increase in effectiveness and results.
Simplification and clarification will also help to avoid delays.
We must, however, be careful.
Has the Commission really thought this through?
It will resume at 9 p.m.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0950/01):
I thank the Minister for his reply.
My question is an SÃS.
This is literally the chronicle of a death foretold.
Three men were imprisoned in 1989.
Question No 2 by (H-0952/01):
Question No 4 by (H-0958/01):
These are the positive signs.
This could be as good an occasion as any.
Question No 5 by (H-0959/01):
.
.
They have been marginalized, humiliated and persecuted.
.
Question No 6 by (H-0963/01):
How does the Council view this state of affairs?
Which Member States do not do so?
And also throughout the period of Socialist government.
The debate will be open and free.
You know that only supplementary questions may be asked.
It is something that is decided in advance.
Otherwise I would very gladly have done so.
They are important questions.
Question No 7 by (H-0966/01):
I therefore agree with what the honourable Member said.
Perhaps there was an interpreting problem.
No, Mr President.
Question No 8 by (H-0967/01):
Question No 9 by (H-0968/01):
.
.
Question No 10 by (H-0969/01):
Question No 11 by (H-0971/01):
We therefore only have references.
.
I think I have made that clear.
Question No 12 by (H-0001/02):
Perhaps he will now answer the point.
Question No 13 by (H-0005/02):
That is a great mistake.
On tax issues, for example.
Question No 15 by (H-0010/02):
Because everything else depends on this.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
There should be no gaps occurring between programming periods.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Economic and social cohesion
Do something about this problem, Commissioner!
The problem is not a small one.
We cannot drop any lower and have reliable policies.
That is for us of primary importance.
We here are quite united in repudiating this.
Now to my final point.
Last week' s proposal strikes me as scandalous.
This forces us to make choices.
Of course, our starting point is fundamentally contradictory.
The overall thrust is quite correct.
There must also be financial discipline.
We are not talking about the cohesion funds.
I will be brief.
It is impossible.
That is quite correct.
We must hold an enlarged Europe together.
I disagree with what Mr Purvis said.
Does that apply to other public sector organisations?
What do we want to do together?
I cannot prove this single-handedly.
We proposed a phasing-in process.
Speed limitation devices
We will then have a great piece of legislation!
I do not believe that is the case.
There are mathematical calculations to show this.
In that case, the traffic flows more smoothly.
These fatal accidents are often caused by speeding.
We need two years as a minimum.
The debate on this report is closed.
Excise duty on rum, liqueurs and eaux-de-vie
2.
The debate is closed.
Galileo Joint Undertaking
That will increase the utility of both systems.
The service will, however, be permanently available.
No decision on it has as yet been reached.
Why am I telling you this?
Our Committees have identified a number of problem areas.
That has already been said several times.
We are today facing the acid test.
The Undertaking will not therefore be judge and judged.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
I actually voted against.
I would appreciate it if this were corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
Thank you, Mr RÃ¼big.
We take note of your observation.
Women's rights and equal opportunities in Mediterranean countries
The report exhaustively describes all these situations.
What is crucial is that we obtain statistics.
The Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco Report gives important pointers to that.
Why is fundamentalism not addressed in greater detail?
It is a destructive tendency.
We must send out a clear message.
I also thank the rapporteur for her efforts.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Illiteracy and social exclusion
Lastly, I cannot accept Amendment No 1.
This is an intolerable situation.
The matter must be integrated into equal opportunities policy.
This participation is crucial.
This means that democracy is diminished.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon today.
Social policy agenda
The result is there for everyone to see.
Enlargement must succeed.
Parliament's role must be a constructive one.
However, the Commission has proposed something different.
An emphasis must be put on better jobs.
It is a new instrument that is being developed.
How do they operate in practice?
I call for including this too in the scoreboard.
They should be taken at national level.
My second comment concerns time.
This brings me to the procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Welcome
Thank you, Mr President, for your visit.

Topical and urgent debate
Terrorist attacks in India, in particular against the Parliament
This is something that gives cause for hope.
On the contrary.
Will the west again repeat this mistake?
The only way forward is through negotiations.
People were murdered.
We should react in the most vigorous way.
What President Musharraf has said is important.
Her election has meant a lot to us Swedes.

The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
on Guantanamo Bay,
on the elections in Madagascar,
on the elections in Cambodia,
on Eritrea.
Guantanamo Bay
What is going on now in Guantanamo Bay?
We can only congratulate them on their efforts.
This is unacceptable.
This is outside American jurisdiction.
The reports of ill-treatment of prisoners is absolutely shocking.
America should abide by those international covenants as well.
This is not clear at present.
Nevertheless, this whole area of jurisprudence ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Barbarianism is a fundamental aspect of imperialism.
Mistreating any person is a crime.
The people will see to that.
That is also the reason for our resolution.
Let me take this opportunity to say something else.
This has to be the fundamental question.
Gregori Pasko does not want a pardon.
This is not about an admission of guilt.
He is in the right!
He is still in prison.
This is the policy of the European Union.
This is a ridiculous policy.
This is a worrying development.
Elections in Madagascar.
Let there be no misunderstanding about this.
Human rights supporters are becoming disillusioned.
Elections in Cambodia
Eritrea
I was there as a UN observer.
90% of people voted in that referendum.
99% voted for independence.
President Isaias was elected president.
For some years the problem was border conflict.
Now sadly the problem is internal.
The Italian ambassador has been expelled.
Democracy has been cancelled in Eritrea.
Turn away from totalitarianism".
Human rights are not just for our benefit.
They are not to make us feel good.
The Italian ambassador has been expelled.
The international community cannot just stand by and watch.

Stimulating Internet access
We understand the pressures on the time of Commissioners.
That really is what this is all about.
That is really at the heart of this question.
We know that quite a lot has moved forward.
We understand our role and responsibility here.
New services will be delivered with them.
So the Commission is clearly operating at two levels.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Rail freight in the Channel Tunnel
The next item is the joint debate on:
Added to my list is the European Commission.
That means free movement through the Channel Tunnel.
There are problems.
But we need to get freight through unfettered.
The problems we face at the moment are acute.
It is a vital debate.
We need traffic on the railways.
We also need traffic by sea.
This is a fundamental issue that should be resolved.
What measures are therefore being taken to repatriate them?
This is a tragedy, and why?
I think that this is very important.
This clearly does not apply in the present case.
Why has traffic been suspended?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Vote
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Bonde and SandbÃ¦k (EDD), in writing.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 6.40 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Mr President, thank you for that statement.
Order of business
I move now to the order of business.
(The House agreed to this proposal)
Decisions taken at today's meeting
Thirdly, we must rethink Community policies.
First and foremost, stability and security.
(Applause)
You then talked about the Mediterranean.
... to both these Member States.
(Interruptions)
Just calm down!
It is your convictions too that I am expressing.
The Council is not here today.
(Applause)
In my opinion, this is a good idea.
The second point is security.
A further point is the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank.
What were the political and economic aims behind this?
This we have done.
We have not carried out any special assessments.
Mr President, a complaint and three messages.
Please carry on in this way.
You have added Afghanistan and other priorities.
No representative of the Council is present.
You have our support.
I will make a final point.
It wanted it afterwards and it wants it now.
I believe this is very important.
Here is a brief response to a brief question.
This is the line we are taking.
...
These are facts, statistics.
I am not criticising or passing judgment.
This is a practical display of solidarity.
.
Why have I mentioned this, Mrs Randzio-Plath?
Which countries will take part?
Today our delegation has obtained the fifth draft agenda.
Turning now to the Commission President, Mr Prodi.
That is major progress.
Thank you President Prodi.
That was not foreseen for this session.
This is what I wanted to say:
Mr President.
I have four comments to make on this report.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Barcelona European Council
The next item is the joint debate on:
The completion of the process ...
Mr President ...
Not all parliaments are so friendly to the government.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Barcelona will therefore be a milestone along that road.
A success for the whole of Europe.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr President.
We are in a new situation.
We want organised markets.
The European Parliament has done its job.
Evidently, we were wrong.
It contained two different strategies.
One simply cannot just go on compromising.
It is the most important aspect to come.
Muchas palabras sin hechos.
This would be a serious misinterpretation.
This is another matter altogether.
.
How do we respond to low rates of growth?
Are we to abandon these objectives?
Mr Poettering counselled greater modesty.
I will tell you why.
What does Lisbon focus on?
.
Where are directives not yet being transposed?
She faces a tremendous uphill struggle.
I represent the south west of England.
We have exhausted fish stocks.
We have fishermen with no fish to catch.
What is our message to a country like that?
I would say a final word to Mrs Jackson.
Somebody has been selling false currency in this Parliament.
What has to be on the agenda in Barcelona?
Firstly, reform of the education systems.
Thirdly, reform of the social partnership.
Fifthly, reform of the States' budgets.
Of course, not everything in Europe is perfect.
The American model is not always to be commended.
Liberalisation, however, does not mean deregulation.
The Socialists are in favour of macro-economic stability.
On the contrary.
I think this plan is a really good initiative.
They must be guaranteed social rights.
Hence our firm opposition to this Commission document.
\
The second warning is this.
The real question, however, is what Europe?
Liberalisation provides the magic answer.
Can this just be national self-interest?
I think that this need is universal.
We need strong signs and practical action.
It is crucial that we listen to them.
Nowhere has unemployment fallen so dramatically as in Spain.
How did this come about?
This is really outrageous!
This must also be put a stop to.
The Spanish Presidency, however, is not pretending.
It is working with great honesty.
Can we pretend to believe this?
He wants high-quality employment and flexibility in the market.
He has explicitly aired the ethical problems.
I want to address three points.
The Commission is tempted to give this 1 billion.
This is unacceptable.
(Applause from the right)
And yet, what do we have?
What do we have?
What has become of their impetus?
Mr President, the Lisbon strategy was a success.
It must not just be about liberalisation.
We have an outdated model which needs modernising.
That cannot be done in an ad hoc way.
But we must also take account of territorial criteria.
Something else also worries me, however.
Allow me just to mention a couple of examples.
I have just two comments to make.
Why?
I would now like to mention two specific points.
Thank you, Mr President.
Spain is a good example of this.
The candidate countries have been mentioned.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
International Criminal Court
It will certainly require more.
Thank you, Mr de Miguel.
.
Mr President, right is wrong.
It should naturally be universal.
The court should not become too European.
Slowly, it is true, but spreading nonetheless.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The Constitutional Court is now trying the HADEP case.
.
Initial results are already visible.
Allow me to draw a clear comparison.
I believe that we cannot accept that.
I welcome the unanimous support for both these initiatives.
They are charged with separatism.
How are the thousand refugees meant to survive?
Thank you very much, Mrs Uca.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.

The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
1999 discharge (measures taken by Commission)
Light was shed on all the sectors.
The agricultural area is a shining example.
The framework agreement is a mess.
We must ensure value for money.
IRELA still has EUR 3.4 million to repay.
It has been really splendid.
What have you got to hide?
It is therefore unacceptable in its current form.
We wholeheartedly support this report too.
Nonetheless, it still exists as a legal body.
OLAF has now submitted a report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Supplementary estimates for 2002 - DAB 1/2002
How will this EUR 4 million be managed?
Despite this, there has been some criticism.
This has been emphasised by the rapporteurs.
What procedures are envisaged for this process?
This does not reflect the spirit of the Treaty.
It made no reference at all to Parliament!
This is very bizarre.
We will vigorously resist any moves in this direction.
What are these other sundry expenses?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
EU relations with South Caucasus
However, the catastrophic situation is not entirely self-inflicted.
The environmental situation in the South Caucasus is alarming.
All nations have skeletons in their historical cupboards.
Congratulations!
Let us hope so!
The EU can operate as an active mediator.
Mr Gahrton and I are in agreement.
Reflection and diplomacy are required.
I should like to single out two controversial points.
All of these issues have been smouldering for years.
No energy-supply lines can pass through the Caucasus.
That is not the case.
It is Europe's gateway to Asia.
But where does this leave Europe?
Thank you very much Mr President.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Impact of transport on public health
This is also a very timely debate.
I would counter that very strongly.
We need to be very clear about that.
Action in this field is urgent.
We will be delighted to give it our support.
I hope we shall obtain a good result.
20 000 by that time.
The second factor is traffic pollution.
We can however, improve further.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Labour cost index
Mr Mayol i Raynal has the floor.
That is the objective of Article 1.
The data must be broken down by economic categories.
Here are a few points to consider.
It may, however, raise some questions.
We shall therefore reject these amendments.
That is an overstatement of the situation.
These total costs are quite insignificant.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.13 p.m.)
It gives us a way to plan forward.
This very useful publication should be made widely available.
Socrates Programme
Centralisation has huge advantages but requires effective information management.
The first point is the question of decentralisation.
My second point is the question of financial control.
I think we have the right to expect results.
So how are things being done this time round?
Nevertheless, I should like to make some observations.
This is unacceptable to my group.
This must of necessity be rectified.
Linguistic skills are certainly important for labour mobility.
What is the reason for that?
The courses of study were also reasonably successful.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner.
What is my brief here?
Obviously to canvass for this marvellous programme.
Socrates does not resolve any fundamental problems.
I welcome the report which is positive.
Its support has been invaluable.
Thank you all again.
This is actually starting to happen.
That is great!
I am entirely on your side.
All those involved have referred to administrative burdens.
The new procedures are now in place.
Symmetry will be developed in 2002 and 2003.
Delivery is planned for August 2003.
Lastly, there are the Joint Actions.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Culture 2000 Programme
What actions involve our fellow citizens?
Is there a sufficient constituent basis amongst European communities?
Is there any cultural identity between them?
This is very useful.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner.
As an actress that is nothing new to me.
It is all too familiar.
We have two major problems.
These details are all contained in the report.
There are plenty of problems.
We seem to have reached a turning point.
Fostering, support and encouragement are certainly called for.
More is probably needed.
We now take decisions.
Matters of principle need to be discussed.
What should the role of Member States be?
What should their initiatives involve?
What should the European Union do?
So much for the theory.
The budget is and always has been derisory.
Mainstream culture has a much easier time of it.
That is what creates European added value.
We gladly brag about that with undisguised pride.
We must monitor projects very carefully.
This is certainly the case and must be recognised.
There is nothing left in the kitty.
This represents 12% of the total.
These are not fine words.
It is what is actually happening in the field.
We believe that is entirely reasonable.
You are quite right.
In fact the opposite proved the case.
We would like a changeover.
I have in mind the Euro-Mediterranean project.
Thank you, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Youth Programme
.
This was more difficult in the decentralised projects.
There is a need for further work here.
I think that is acceptable.
.
I see that, though, as appropriate.
I refer to young immigrants.
Why is this programme valuable?
The GrÃ¶ner report is on the right lines.
I have no wish to make any false assumptions.
It is, in fact, the polar opposite.
This is indeed civilising work, not mere propaganda
This good work will, of course, continue.
Then there is the issue of girls.
A series of meetings is planned.
Thank you, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.

Resolution on Barcelona European Council
, in writing.
.
We strongly believe in social inclusion.
We believe it is the other way round.
And there can be no middle way here.
This is why we voted against the Bullmann report.
We are basically well-disposed towards the European Union.
These issues are not of a directly cross-border nature.
Politics will become more anonymous and inaccessible.

Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 12.11)
Resumption of the session
We now move to the order of business.
Wednesday:
This is the only reason, Mr President.
Mr President, I really did not understand that.
I really do crave your indulgence.
Could we perhaps clarify this again?
That is the only reason.
There is nothing else behind this proposal.
I hope he is feeling alright.
I would like to make that explicit today.
Just listen for a moment!
I always listen to you.
That is the condition we impose.
They also raise side issues which could affect Kashmir.
(Applause)
(Laughter and applause)
Mr President, on a point of order.
Mr President, on a point of order.
The tunnel was closed last Wednesday.
This is affecting jobs in the UK and elsewhere.
It is affecting businesses.
Nobody seems to care about what is happening here.
I have asked the Commission to address this situation.
No-one seems to care.
This is a matter which requires immediate attention.
We discussed this during the previous part-session.
.
Mr President, on a point of order.
To date we have received no reply.
It may be that translating it is taking time.
The solutions are difficult and complex.
The report examines various existing proposals on international taxes.
Globalism has led to a world of interconnected communities.
Global problems require global solutions.
The first is the issue of sustainable development.
That is not the way to consolidate global governance.
The third and final question is democracy.
As Europeans, how can we find another way?
I believe it is our duty to do so.
Ignore these responsibilities and globalisation becomes a minefield.
Commissioner, you mentioned Tobin tax.
Globalisation, liberalisation and deregulation are not synonymous.
We must persuade them to be more open.
Quite the opposite.
We tell them to participate in a common undertaking.
The vision of competition alone cannot prevail.
In my opinion, both forums are one-sided.
That is simply impossible.
So are there no problems at all?
That is a big problem.
This is why so much is riding on Barcelona.
We must insist on this point.
Is this sufficient?
Possibly not.
We probably have to consider more ambitious elements.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Instead, they see everything in terms of Brussels.
This report concerns the frameworks for information and communication.
It is a splendid initiative.
We would ask the Commission how much.
Many thanks.
.
Let me turn to Mr Andreasen's report.
That was precisely what the people did.
Its secrecy does a profound disservice to Europe.
Are we really getting value for money?
We need to be more positive about Euronews.
IT is properly addressed in the report.
This report is not before time.
It must not be allowed to gather dust.
My second point concerns interinstitutional cooperation.
My third point relates to partnership with civil society.
The Council itself acknowledged this.
, rapporteur.
Mr President, this is the prize.
The proposal was totally unacceptable on this score.
They feel a little neglected.
I can only say that I welcome that inordinately.
I hope that is so.
That is the case and will remain so.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at noon.
.
We asked for controlled and gradual liberalisation.
Did the Council agree with that?
Yes, they did.
Did we get that?
Yes, we did.
Did they agree with that?
Yes, they did.
Did they give us that?
Yes, they did.
The Council common position will unravel, and collapse.
Mr Simpson too has already referred to it.
I am not one of them.
I am certainly not one of them either.
The common position is somewhere in between.
This is very important.
This is not wise, in my view.
We must prevent this happening at all costs.
Why?
Certainly not.
There is nothing new in the debate.
There is absolutely nothing new here.
I urge my fellow Members?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Who is correct?
We have to acknowledge this.
This is positive.
Our delegation will support it accordingly.
The first thing is the financing of universal service.
And this is no small matter.
The second point is the conditions of network access.
That will be the case only in 2006.
What is the most important aspect of this discussion?
What is the issue here?
Let me mention four points.
This concerns Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken on Wednesday at noon.
The assistant simply belongs in the organisational chart.
I very much echo what Mrs Buitenweg has said.
We are not as flexible as I would like.
That, though, is our objective.
It is the lack of balance that surprises us.
That is why this issue is so difficult.
The reason was as follows:
(the speaker continued in French)
(the speaker continued in Swedish)
These are the facts.
Why do we need a Data Protection Supervisor?
Let us move on to remuneration.
Why that should be the case completely eludes me.
That regulation provides for exceptions to access.
The rights balance each other out.
Neither takes precedence over the other.
The draft decision takes account of the two references.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
The programme has been late in arriving.
The priorities have been unclear.
We should also become better at appointing rapporteurs promptly.
The database should be publicly available.
The Commission has the right of initiative.
My group does not seek to change that.
It has the right of initiative.
Congratulations once again to Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
(The sitting was closed at 9.15 p.m.)
Opening of the session
Mr Ilgenfritz, I appreciate your request.
Thank you very much, Mr Stevenson.
Thank you very much, Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n.
Thank you.
So an end to hypocrisy!
A5-0068/2002 by Mr FÃ¤rm for Section III
and
We are on the way towards an activity-based budget.
This is a tenth of the entire budget.
The budget debate will also be a little different.
I believe this is vital.
The first is enlargement.
The solution will involve cutbacks in all the institutions.
That would just not be on.
There are in fact only two options.
That has already been underlined in this House.
Why temporary staff?
The Financial Plan does not permit it.
They have different needs in terms of budgets.
Issue No 2: foreign policy.
That is just not practicable in the long term.
There is more to come.
Issue No 3: agricultural policy.
It should not be left to Parliament.
We want to prevent social exclusion.
Is the best possible use being made of it?
My group stresses the importance of strict budgetary discipline.
The situation is therefore alarming.
Accountability and result-oriented management are the key words here.
There are special requirements associated with enlargement.
Surely this cannot be our aim.
There are 800 of them.
There are none.
Clearly, there is something wrong!
This is not a day too soon.
Let me explain that for everyone's benefit.
All of it should be poverty-focused.
I fully support that particular point.
That is my gripe.
The first is on the FÃ¤rm report.
I now turn to Mr Stenmarck's report.
They should not wear political colours.
I wish them every success.
The same applies to category 5.
I have seen a draft letter in this respect.
We will not achieve anything that way.
All of this should be reviewed, Mr President.
That is the principle I wholeheartedly support.
Why?
Some form of restructuring will be needed there.
This means that economies are to be reckoned with.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
We must also support informed choice for our customers.
We need labelling.
There are five preconditions for this.
What counts here is physics and not the law.
The place where the electricity is generated is significant.
This depends on many factors.
This brings me to my second subject.
A supply monopoly cannot be justified.
This too violates current law.
We owe this to our consumers.
What is on today's agenda?
So what are the key points?
The consumer must have free choice.
And this could never be the intention.
But that is precisely what it is.
This is an integral part of this directive.
This imbalance is unacceptable.
The present situation is a flawed and inequitable market.
This must change.
This is an unnecessary amount of detail.
The situation harms solidarity and must end.
Cross-border transmission tariffs and overload control are important matters.
Firstly, electricity and gas are two different products.
The gas supply is literally at stake here.
Too many new obligations are being imposed.
Second reading might provide an opportunity to change this.
I am in favour of these measures.
The anticipated increase in productivity did not take place.
The public have experienced increased inequality.
Nor should cross-subsidisation of any kind be admissible.
It has been a complex subject.
That is the aim of my amendment.
Some Members here advocate opening up to competition.
I should like to make two points.
He is absolutely correct.
This is relevant.
However, this is an overly restrictive provision.
We cannot therefore accept this amendment either.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 12 noon today.
The next item is the vote.
Simplified procedure:
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal as amended)
and
(In successive votes Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)
(The President declared the common position approved)
Before the vote:
I hope there are no objections to this.
Report FÃ¤rm (A5-0068/2002)
Hence our position against the report.
.
Bad-quality translations and overburdened staff cannot solve this problem.
What is the meaning of this?
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
But we will make the necessary corrections.
I believe that we have found that compromise.
What can be done about this?
There are two types of measures.
The Hushkits Regulation had to be scrapped.
The Commissioner had no other choice.
And why the benefit of the doubt?
And I wish you, Commissioner, every success.
We see three points rather differently.
Once again many thanks to the rapporteur.
I do not think so.
We had the choice.
I feel happy on both sides.
Then suddenly, there was action.
I look forward to the report.
Who wants incredibly noisy aircraft in Europe?
From London to Manchester, from Maastricht to Bierset.
This is something I cannot endorse.
I thought you might be interested.
However, I have many reservations.
I am not happy about the whole procedure.
So the 1 April deadline still looks rather ambitious.
Noise should be reduced where that is needed most.
May President Bush learn a lesson from it.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
There can be no social modernity without human modernity.
Women are currently the main bringers of social modernity.
A similar verdict has been passed in Sudan.
I think there is a serious problem in Poland.
Our intelligentsia must make this effort.
I share this view.
The mufti of Marseille
The rapporteur was willing to do so.
In fact, the Koran prohibits this practice.
This is no longer religion, but fundamentalism.
This is incorrect.
Cooperation always leads to better results.
Allow me to explain.
This time it concerned the United States.
Quite the reverse, in fact.
The report arrogantly prescribes what is good and evil.
Religions are treated with a negative and biased approach.
People only have rights.
We must take care.
Many compromise amendments have now been tabled.
I am slightly uncomfortable with this report.
This is a historical fact that cannot be denied.
That does not exist.
My words are addressed to all followers of religion.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
They will not do it!
They are fighting against contraception and abortion.
We know it, fundamentalism or not.
Let us think seriously and clearly about all that.
The report makes two mistakes.
The problem is the separation of religion from politics.
We can and must take action.
Yet is fundamentalism not a caricature of religion?
The report is more anti-religion than it is pro-woman.
The report is also inconsistent.
Moreover, the report is full of careless formulations.
That should be the report's most significant argument.
Many women are awaiting our commitment on this issue.
Women are never involved in interpreting the Koran.
This proposal is quite specific.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
I propose this in the light of two factors.
We know that noise can have incredibly harmful effects.
The possible effects of noise are very well documented.
I turn now to the music and entertainment industry.
We have a compromise proposal I can live with.
I am in actual fact extremely satisfied with it.
Mr President, many congratulations to the rapporteur.
She has produced a very well-balanced report.
That is what this proposal is all about.
These developments are to be deplored.
At least two factors seem to be at work.
Sound plays a central role in this industry.
This outcry raises three interesting points.
All employees are covered, except for seamen.
This is now being rectified.
(Interjection: Or even in Parliament!)
Of course, there are rules at national level.
However, I take little comfort from this.
This is not just my own view.
I suspect the answer will be no surprise.
I liked what the rapporteur said about music.
I think the figures speak for themselves.
Finally to ear protection available on the market.
Mr President, two things.
I therefore hope that the Commission will reconsider them.
No.
Thank you very much.
The vote is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mrs de Palacio has the floor.
Cover expires at the end of March.
What is the European Commission's position on this?
That is the reason for my two supplementary questions.
When will you do so?
Do you intend to tackle this problem as well?
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
Sometimes, third countries are reluctant to do this.
Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio.
That concludes this item.
Part I
Subject: International adoption of Romanian children
The child's interests are the priority.
Are there any alternative systems?
Commission.
Subject: Chemical and electro-shock technology
The question was then posed by Mrs Wemheuer.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
Subject: Take-over bids
I look forward to a thorough discussion and cooperation.
Thank you very much, Mrs Riis-JÃ¸rgensen.
That is very kind of you.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Second part
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
What steps are planned?
In addition, this measure is only provisional.
I should like to give you two examples.
We do not believe in such a system.
It would involve a fundamental change in international relations.
That is our guiding principle.
First of all, it is a good idea.
Questions to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m
Subject: Packaging and packaging waste
I think that there are deadlines.
Can you tell me what your views are?
Subject: Water Framework Directive
Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
I am aware of the Marina study.
I am very interested in its outcome.
I have also made a complaint.
We are, of course, following developments closely.
We are looking forward to a reply from him.
We base that on the best available scientific knowledge.
Subject: Brominated flame retardants
These are: penta-BDE, octa-BDE and deca-BDE.
That is also all well and good.
I agree entirely.
We must have control of where these substances occur.
There is a great deal of interest in it.
Subject: Ireland's compliance with EU environmental laws
Questions to Commissioner Fischler
The immediate focus is now on the Nitrates directive.
At the same time environmental damage continues.
We must address that.
.
I therefore support your answer
This is a supplementary point.
We look into those as speedily as possible.
This is what I intend to do.
Subject: Quota buy-back by tobacco producers
Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
Have you perhaps any more news on this front?
Commissioner, please give us a detailed answer.
That is my position here.
I think that this is an entirely fair approach.
These relations are governed by the Barcelona Process.
This is disgraceful!
Our approach to the negotiations is very constructive.
Subject: Breaking up of fishing vessels
On what basis is the Commission granting these appropriations?
Subject: EU export subsidies for agricultural produce
Subject: Phasing-out of export subsidies
Why?
We can see this destruction taking place every day.
It is out of genuine interest.
We must find ways of preserving these areas.
This is not enough.
No mention is made of biodiversity.
What is the connection?
The protection of biodiversity deserves top priority.
Action plans cannot be non-committal.
They must set priorities.
This motivates and inspires.
Subsidies purely based on production are asking for trouble.
The fishery implications for biodiversity are less visible.
This should be met with a forceful response.
Biodiversity must form a guideline in regional planning.
Member States should draft action plans for that purpose.
How would things stand regarding biodiversity then?
This is being done with EAGGF Funds.
They represent an important part of the rural infrastructure.
Biodiversity is not their main concern.
What added value does this kind of certification provide?
I have sad news tonight.
The Pyrenean mountain goat has vanished for ever.
However, this is not enough.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
If only that were so!
.
(Applause)
Her work currently has great significance.
The food supplements market is growing fast.
Food supplements can make a positive contribution to health.
We must therefore separate the chaff from the wheat.
If only!
I recently received 35 letters from anxious consumers.
A clear example of misinformation.
Multi-vitamin tablets can still be taken.
Is that too much to ask?
However, their use has so far been restricted.
Safety must be the main concern.
We do not do this for food either.
I would urge you to vote for this directive.
The market that this generates is huge.
Parliament made its view heard.
This is wrong, simply wrong!
I consider that the public health arguments are weak.
This is clearly stated by the Treaties.
This is not a strong argument in my opinion.
This is not the case here.
Its methods and its content have been counter-productive.
However, I have more fundamental objections.
This was met with little support at the time.
Many consumers share this hope.
Mr President, this is a bad directive.
She has done a valiant job.
Where is the evidence that they are unsafe?
I say to Commissioner Byrne: be careful.
It should not be done by secret committees.
I do not know what you are talking about.
I have nothing against that.
Every single manufacturer must be able to do that.
And they would be right to do so.
They would then be exempted in future too.
They drank themselves to death in one session.
This directive sends out the wrong signals.
For this reason I support it.
It has been ignored in the PPP directive.
My God, we have tried!
Two wrongs do not make a right.
You cannot have the one without the other.
(Applause from the left)
Is this what you really want?
Consumers will not forgo these products.
I believe that this directive is an own goal.
Is this really what you want?
Member States have different traditions in this area.
I personally believe both sides are wrong.
We should trust individuals to do so.
That is simply criminal harassment.
This is not the case.
Vitamins have side-effects.
The impact, of course, is not immediate.
It is like when you drink too much.
I fail to understand your thinking.
It has to do with maximum safety levels.
That really is not the position.
That is the purpose of the exercise.
That is a slander.
It is absolutely wrong.
What about that?
The subject is not an easy one.
They are in favour of this legislation.
Mrs MÃ¼ller has done an excellent job as rapporteur.
I sincerely congratulate her and thank her.
He supports this legislation.
The text of Article 5 is now carefully balanced.
For this reason I cannot accept Amendment No 8.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
and
It has gone incredibly well.
These amendments concern the marking of category 1 material.
I have checked this very carefully.
These birds have to have this special food.
Amendment 15 concerns the separation of facilities.
However, two problems emerge from this situation.
I signed them because they are compromises.
The ideal world is different.
To my knowledge, this has not been proved.
We must be very careful.
That is a fact.
Some say it is burned.
Nobody really knows.
That is precisely what we do not want.
But it must then apply to all Member States.
In the main this report can be adopted.
Thank you for that.
I acknowledge her efforts.
That will take time.
They will become sumps of noxious material.
Something needs to be done about this.
I do not believe they have any substance.
The European Parliament has shown courage.
They were no bad thing.
It would be the death of them.
So both positions exist.
That is why I tabled my proposal.
Your compromise proposal, Mrs Paulsen, is fine.
We shall then have a sound solution.
Serious animal diseases have thus been able to spread.
Strict rules govern the procedure for such recycling.
Here we have the example of pigswill.
This sort of thing affects small and medium-sized abattoirs.
Confidence in the processing facilities is high.
What life of luxury is Europe trying to lead?
Nobody would wish this to occur again.
This is already comprehensively covered by the TSE Regulation.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
That is bad enough.
We are addressing many demands to the Commission today.
I should like to mention at least three reasons.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Statement by the President
(Loud applause)
I am much obliged to you for your initiative.
It is entirely appropriate and has my full support.
I feel we are all agreed on that.
This is essential to reaching a solution.
There is a great deal to be done.
I therefore believe we must persevere with this approach.
We shall persevere along these lines.
A clear timeframe was then drawn up at Gothenburg.
It is worth emphasising the magnitude of this challenge.
Finally, there is the chapter on institutions.
They represent approximately 80% of the Community budget.
I imagine that further details will follow.
They have been debated seriously and in depth.
We are now at a critical juncture.
The Commissioner responsible deserves particular recognition.
That is only to be expected.
Hopefully this will come about very soon.
I should like to deal with Cyprus separately.
Decrees.
The Commission takes the view that those Bene?
That also applies to agricultural policy.
Perhaps I should just quote some figures.
The plan is still in place.
Negotiations are progressing at a brisk pace.
The next stage is clearly mapped out.
We are not going along with that.
I think there are still many obstacles.
Denmark must naturally be willing to pay.
The proposal was neither circulated nor debated.
Signalling different treatment is wrong and deeply damaging.
Instead, I now hear about it through leaks.
We have just heard a reference to Kaliningrad.
We only have to recall the German experience.
What kind of enlargement will it be?
Will ten countries be joining or not?
I think these questions deserve careful consideration.
All these thoughts should be aired in the House.
I find the debate on the Czech Republic intolerable.
There are the politically inflammatory problems with the Bene?
The moment of truth is approaching.
A 'European-style' peace.
I support his underlying principles.
Their accession remains conditional.
A moment ago, I heard Italy being mentioned.
Decrees.
Who said that it would be simple?
Who believed that it would not cost anything?
2002 must not be a lost year.
Enlargement must not be delayed.
Questions therefore arise and demand to be answered.
Mr Verheugen referred to one of them himself.
I have two questions to ask.
Have we made the necessary financial and technical arrangements?
Decrees.
This greatly gladdens my heart.
What is at the heart of the Bene?
Decrees is no different.
This consensual system has resulted in two key achievements.
This perspective will remain in force until 2006.
Not only there, either, might I add!
So what are we doing now?
Then there is the matter of public opinion.
A final point: languages.
Here I support everything Mr BÃ¶ge has just said.
I believe we must retain the principle of multilingualism.
Unemployment, poverty and suppression are spreading.
I listened carefully to what they had to say.
The Union began with six Member States.
There are now 15.
Take the Balkans as an example.
The same is true for these countries.
What are we offering these countries?
It certainly will not.
That is something quite different.
They are quite right, of course.
I trust the same is true of Parliament.
Political will is essential but it is not sufficient.
We are all committed to ensuring success.
That is not on!
My second observation relates to finances.
I can tell you that that is quite sufficient.
We do not, though, negotiate like that.
The discussion on the Bene?
The debate is closed.
Now it is our turn to show such solidarity.
Mr President, I will finish here.
Let us start then with steel.
Well, on 6 March it was not working.
We are therefore ready.
We had taken the necessary precautions.
We will not close our market to steel imports.
I will pass quickly over the multilateral aspect.
Let us dwell more on the bilateral side.
This is not always easy.
Personally, I am in favour of such initiatives.
That surely is not the way to go.
This applies to many things.
The question is: how do we rebuff it?
Allow me to illustrate this with two examples.
Macedonia and Afghanistan are good examples of this.
They are blocking controls on biological weapons.
Where do we go from here?
The debate is adjourned.
What we are being targeted with is not spam.
Spam is untargeted.
The next item is the vote.
Simplified procedure:
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
They are led by Senator Leonard Gustaffson.
We welcome them here.
We now continue with the vote.
Before the vote:
.
Mr President, I think Mr Wuermeling is correct.
But we will let your committee look at it.
(Parliament adopted the decision)
Before the vote:
Mr President, this is a procedural motion.
Before the vote:
Lies have been disseminated as to her motivation.
(Loud applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(The President declared the common position approved)
Before the vote:
The problem is that they refer to different dates.
I cannot approve this oral amendment.
You know the Rules.
That is the case.
Before the vote on Amendment No. 72:
We rejected that.
I hope that was confusing enough for you!
Before the vote on Amendment No. 136:
It is just about correcting something.
Before the vote on Amendment No. 149:
(Laughter)
But enough joking.
This is found in the committee's amendment.
This would then be added to Amendment No 149.
(Applause)
The first error is in Amendment No 48.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(2000/2174(INI))
Before the vote on Amendment No. 21:
That is the issue.
You are right.
Before the vote on Amendment No. 29:
That is very kind of you.
You have been listening to your mother again.
And by what right?
Does not this internal market exist today?
All of this is laughable.
This is our vision of a public service.
.
It therefore seeks to impose its own priorities.
This is a good initiative.
.
Having said which, we need:
.
.
I am confident that Mrs Banotti will handle this.
That is not the case.
That right has been taken away from them today.
Take the example of pregnant women.
I urge us all to support better regulation.
Many people in Europe take vitamins and mineral supplements.
.
I have voted against the report.
In whose interests is this to be done?
Why should it be done specifically within this area?
How would it affect the individual citizen?
Which manufacturers would suffer, and which benefit?
The European Union's decisions must be consistent.
.
We therefore voted against these two reports.
Energy is not a marketable commodity like any other!
This is utterly irresponsible and unacceptable.
France should uphold this position at the Barcelona Council.
It is as follows:
His report therefore misses the point.
.
.
.
.
I will be voting against the proposal.
.
That is a system that works very well indeed.
But these are not the same phenomenon at all.
Everyone agrees that fundamentalism can appear in many guises.
It can be religious, political or ideological.
This is a fundamental principle.
.
On what authority?
With what qualifications?
.
I abstained on this report.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
The communication from the Council indicates this.
Yet, what is happening now is the reverse.
States are crumbling in Africa.
Nobody can regulate the world on their own.
Each new trade dispute is one too many.
We want nothing to do with that particular value.
That is something we are not prepared to accept.
There has been no sudden calamitous increase in imports.
We know why.
Talk about collateral damage!
Of course, this cannot be tolerated.
Our market is open.
Commission: take him on.
Go for it!
We must be tough and then we will succeed.
The cause is good.
The arguments are correct.
Steel is an old chestnut.
I would certainly support him in that.
We do not have overcapacity now.
Just whose side is Tony's crony on?
Thank you for this promptness.
Transatlantic relations are now in stormy waters.
The steel crisis is mainly political.
President Bush is backed internally by his electorate.
Our retaliation must be convincing.
But we also need good helmsmanship.
We must build a solid ship.
We must show we mean business.
The next item is the Oral Questions:
and
The regulation does not grant freedom of movement.
They simply state it.
It is an explanation that Parliament is now seeking.
My final comments relate to enlargement.
However, the annexes are still under negotiation.
Mr President, I am both angry and sad.
Why?
This is my first question.
Is this an attempt to reintroduce that?
Please note - an update.
We must all pull together.
Firstly, the system of taxation and social security.
Ireland has indicated that it is going to participate.
The debate is closed.
It is a matter, then, of choosing.
We might now think that target was over-ambitious.
Perhaps we should be honest and totally forget it.
We should move away from that.
Just a few more words by way of conclusion.
I absolutely must warn against that.
At what price?
At the price of all-out, dog-eat-dog warfare.
But how should we respond?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Please stick to your speaking time.
But how is Europe to do this?
This is not the case.
We certainly always debated them together in committee.
I do not need to repeat that.
I stand by the Lisbon objectives.
We have to become independent from America's economy.
So there is not a level competitive playing field.
Customers who must have money.
That means that we have to increase demand.
Demand must come from both public and private investment.
To do that, we need a skilled workforce.
That is unfortunately not what I see.
That is not enough.
We believe that this is a fundamental element.
Where must we go in the long term?
How can we increase our production potential?
I completely agree with each of these points.
However, I would like to add one point.
This is undoubtedly a point which warrants attention.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The risk will become higher and higher.
And so the last misgivings have now melted away.
Yes, the directive is needed urgently.
My warm thanks are extended to both institutions.
It resolutely addresses the key problems.
Preventive measures must be paramount.
This is why greater transparency is essential.
The current procedures are glaringly inefficient.
Our preference is for administrative penalties.
In Europe, regulators' budgets are often derisory.
This is a nonsense.
We also considered the degree of guilt.
Such offences can only be committed intentionally.
It certainly does have major implications.
We have to take appropriate corrective measures here.
Thank you very much, Mrs Riis-JÃ¸rgensen.
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
This is my specific, supplementary question.
Thank you for your response.
Commissioner Poul Nielson has not yet been to Chechnya.
Could the Council meet with them?
Mr Dupuis, on a point of order.
Yes, Mr President, I can answer.
Subject: Spanish Presidency's measures against opponents of globalisation
Can the Council confirm this information?
Subject: Position of the Spanish Presidency on demonstrations
Thank you for your reply.
They could not be making a worse decision.
Your are raising points of order.
Another action is the participation in world associations.
Subject: Languages used by the Spanish Presidency
No.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you, Mrs Cerdeira.
Is the Council therefore incompetent?
I would like an answer.
Mr President, no.
Subject: Spanish Presidency and relations with Morocco
Subject: EU export subsidies for agricultural produce
I have two follow-up questions.
Mr President, I shall now answer.
I thank the Spanish Presidency for its answer.
I have a number of follow-up questions.
Is it laudable that different assessments have been made?
That is unthinkable.
Is it true?
Do you know anything about it?
Subject: Prospects for the Barcelona Process
Special attention is therefore being devoted to this issue.
I will take charge of the point of order.
Mr MacCormick, on a point of order.
Would you like to make a statement?
There are limits to our willingness to cooperate.
We are in absolute agreement on that.
Likewise, investors need serious information.
This is of course a positive move.
Let us maintain it, we need it.
The Commission proposal needs significant revision.
Shelf registration should be optional and not compulsory.
I will deal with each issue in turn.
I begin by commending him on that excellent report.
Amendment No 31 requires the Commission to consult industry.
I agree.
It restricts consultation to a handful of Brussels federations.
I think that Parliament would also consider that necessary.
I agree with the spirit of those amendments.
That does not reflect reality.
I should like to underline that.
We must do everything to stamp it out.
That is what Amendment No 35 is about.
How do we explain that to European investors?
Both these aims are equally important.
To sum up, the Commission rejects 29 amendments.
Thank you, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
As the rapporteur, I support the two amendments.
The result is a compromise.
Fortunately these ideas were not taken up.
We have also identified potential solutions.
Therefore we have to live with that.
Thank you, Mr Bolkestein.
I think that Mrs Lulling has misunderstood me.
Thank you, Mrs Thyssen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
The issue is on the table.
Why have governments refused to act?
.
Anyway, we are not starting from scratch.
First, it will raise its international profile.
But international legal personality cannot simply be asserted unilaterally.
Within the delegation there is deep disagreement.
All it does is cause trouble.
I very much support this.
It really is very complicated.
That deserves our full attention, given the hour.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Where are we in this process?
The Joint Parliamentary Assembly is at a watershed.
This is detrimental to its parliamentary nature.
We need to get through this bad patch.
As a result there is the question of funding.
It contains many helpful proposals for modifications.
Or can we come up with some other solution?
Greater involvement of civil society will also be key.
But its powers are limited.
Four or five Member States have completed ratification.
That would simply be too embarrassing.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
It is a concept that needs greater clarification.
We fully agree with this objective.
Mrs Carrilho made reference to this as well.
But we are somewhat irritated with last minute action.
What is civil society?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Our thanks are due to them.
We need to make that right path possible.
Generally, it is the children who suffer.
It has been mentioned in the question as well.
This custody he could never exercise.
His children no longer wish to see him.
They need policies to be implemented.
What European law should we draw up?
There are the mechanisms of the Hague.
There is the possibility of developing networks of trust.
You mentioned some programmes for developing those trust measures.
Use them.
Documents were served in a foreign language.
They make the misery of separation even worse.
It will be.
This is how we shall proceed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.

Nuts and locust beans
I have certainly welcomed this.
Over a million hectares are devoted to these crops.
Much of the soil is hillside or arid.
The difficulties are exacerbated by strong outside competition.
The results of the plans proved positive.
There were notable improvements in production and marketing.
This problem has yet to be finally resolved.
A reduction in Community cofinancing is involved, however.
The latter is obviously very important in Catalonia.
It has considerable social impact too.
Now to the 16 proposed amendments.
The first group of amendments deals with general issues.
Secondly, do nuts fulfil a multifunctional role?
And fourthly, if so, in what form?
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Anyone wishing to continue smoking could do so.
What is at issue is simply commercial interest.
The Commission is exceeding its competence on this issue.
I have no objection to that.
Is that what we are trying to do?
Is that our objective?
It is also an excellent natural insecticide.
Secondly, prohibition does not stop consumption.
However, there are three fundamental points to note.
And this populism continues to confuse production with consumption.
This was due to serious mismanagement by the Commission.
It calls for a sizeable workforce on family plots.
I make no apology for that.
Is this a role of the common agricultural policy?
It is a role we have tried to avoid.
If anything should be corrected it is this.
This proposal is a twofold proposal.
Which means that the other question no longer applies.
The same applies to Amendments Nos 10 and 24.
Are you in fact guaranteeing jobs?
I would be grateful for clarification.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Which is where fish come in.
First and foremost, the supply of raw materials.
That includes reducing customs tariffs.
Secondly, environmental measures.
Thirdly, food safety.
Fourthly, enlargement.
The candidate countries are knocking at our door.
Fifthly, fundamentals.
The Green Paper is a clear example of this.
The Langenhagen report addresses the problem as a whole.
This is not always the case.
There are four main problem areas.
Now to the individual points in your report.
Now to the supply situation.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
.
In short, there is nothing to worry about.
This is just a pause for thought.
Why a year?
I must therefore reject Amendments Nos 1 and 3.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The Commissioner might be able to account for this.
This supposed watchdog has been very effectively muzzled.
Now to the individual proposed amendments.
The Commission must reject Amendments Nos 2 and 9.
I cannot accept Amendment No 6.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
That was then revised.
(Parliament decided not to vote on the amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 59
(Parliament decided not to vote on the amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 52
I have a question, Mr President.
(Parliament adopted the amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 44
The House accepts the rapporteur's position.
(Parliament agreed to table the oral amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 46
The same applies to the next oral amendment.
Mr President, we have exactly the same problem.
The oral amendment is part of compromise amendment AC53.
AC53 contains aspects of Amendments Nos 46 and 32.
(Parliament agreed to table the oral amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 54
The proposed amendment arrived very late last night.
In any event, we are opposed.
(Parliament decided not to vote on the amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 48
We accept this compromise.
It seems not.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
.
But the Treaty does not allow it'.
Saving is a very good thing.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Why am I recalling this?
.
Applying double standards lacks all credibility.
I support the call for a policy review.
Tobacco is a product which damages public health.
The Commission proposal is promising.
.
(PT) We are still waiting!
Everyone talks about the mutual benefit.
.
I voted in favour of this report.
I voted in favour of this report.
This is absolutely unacceptable!
More than 43% are therefore in default.
.
The workers stand to gain nothing from this wrangling.
The manipulation goes on.
The EU has largely adopted this free trade ideology.
Transatlantic relations are currently in turmoil.
I voted in favour of this report.
.
The proposals regarding VAT are not bold enough.
Unfortunately, the report contains nothing of this nature.
This is why I reject his approach.
.
Mr Napolitano spoke of establishing a supranational entity.
.
Greater attention needs to be paid to structural support.
That concludes voting time.
Needless to say, we achieved nothing.
This resulted in over 400 massacres in 1999.
The people of Colombia are tired of the fighting.
This position has been expressed in numerous statements.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Taiwan has been actively involved in the WHO.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Zimbabwe
Moldova
Kyrgyzstan
The case of Mr Hamma Hammami in Tunisia
Zimbabwe
This was to be expected.
The list goes on.
However, we do need to maintain the sanctions.
Election laws were changed at the last minute.
We have been active throughout the last two years.
The attitude of African countries has been particularly disappointing.
However, South Africa's leaders were found wanting.
The international community must maintain its resolve.
Freedom of expression is non-existent.
We hoped and believed.
If only that applied to the people of Zimbabwe.
(Applause)
Everything that Mrs SchrÃ¶der said is true.
The Christian Democrat party has been mentioned.
This is creating a good deal of tension.
We must avoid being confronted with a new Belarus.
Moldavia is a poor country in material terms.
We have a big responsibility for Moldavia.
It seems like a good idea to me.
This is not acceptable, in my view.
We therefore welcome this resolution by the European Union.
We have set up a relatively generous aid programme.
Kyrgyzstan is not yet a democracy.
What can we then expect as democrats?
We must apply pressure on the government.
That is certainly true today.
The trial was then postponed until this month.
We will be watching for results.
The only aid is TACIS.
Sometimes the infringements appear to pass unnoticed.
Now, there is cause to do so again.
There have been protests from all around the world.
That must not continue.
We must stop grovelling to Ben Ali.
Two hundred lawyers gathered in support of the defence.
These are the facts.
This trial is a real parody of justice.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 5.30 p.m.
Will the armistice hold at long last?
The monitoring by 30 observers seems very meagre indeed.
Are they capable of doing a proper job?
Our main help has been humanitarian.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
That is all, just to clarify matters.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Thank you Mr Posselt.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Resumption of the session
I have commended this view to the President-in-Office.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr President.
(Applause)
I am totally behind you on this.
This project had been at a standstill for months.
Let us not lose sight of that fact.
(Applause)
Giving in to terrorism means undermining the democratic order.
Today is the second time.
The language used is interesting.
We really wanted more than that.
We wish to warmly congratulate you on your decision.
But that involves combating terrorism on both sides.
(Applause from the right)
We all stand to benefit from that.
I wish the Spanish Presidency every success.
(Applause from the right)
You spoke of public opinion.
For us, combining policies is very important.
(Applause)
We believe that this is absolutely fundamental.
Why do you not review that pact?
(Applause)
(Applause)
?
A final point, Mr President.
We are going to make this a reality.
We are prepared to do so.
The ball is in the Council's court.
You succeeded admirably on both counts.
You are already four months late in implementing this.
We call on you to do so.
Let me quote three examples to illustrate my point.
What conclusions would you draw from this?
What has become of that study?
Is that true or false, Mr President-in-Office?
See you in Seville!
We still have a growing democratic deficit.
It is there that democracy begins.
The voting should also be publicly accessible.
(Applause)
What can we do to create full employment?
It is the opposite of liberalisation.
What has been agreed?
To achieve 10%.
What does that mean?
I fully support the statement on the Middle East.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
I have two points to make in that respect.
This the point Parliament made in the Bullman report.
It will also bring about improved employability.
It is therefore a very welcome step.
I hope the House will support it.
This harms the credibility of all of us.
That is not how to create competitiveness.
Creating competitiveness requires a much more prosaic approach.
I do not share his enthusiasm.
It is tomorrow's Europe.
Both approaches challenge the European social model.
This would be a reasonable and sensible approach.
I am talking about the Mediterranean question.
Fortunately, Mr Aznar has not succeeded.
One example is infrastructure.
It is first and foremost a physical one.
Priorities have to be set.
The same is true of social dialogue.
Competitiveness and protectionism simply do not go together.
I do therefore welcome the Barcelona conclusions.
Will it reopen to heavy goods vehicles or not?
For now, only cars can drive through.
I really would like some clarification on this.
This is one of the problems we are facing.
This also applies to a few more areas.
The evaluation of this liberalisation was very mediocre.
It simply cannot and never will do it.
I refer in particular to the structural reforms needed.
This came across clearly.
I believe this is essential.
After all, they are closer to the citizens.
Congratulations are certainly due on that account.
It is therefore an internal European Union problem.
I regret that Mr Aznar has left the House.
Instead we got a lazy compromise.
I believe that the process is well balanced.
It was as I had feared.
The ecological aspects will clearly disappear in the future.
I have high hopes for the Lisbon process.
That is crucial if the process is to survive.
Just who does the Council consist of?
Yes, we need more transparency.
How should I word it?
Afterwards, they made triumphal assessments.
Curiously, the classical saying seemed to be reversed.
Language education is increasingly in jeopardy.
Mr BarÃ³n is the exception to the rule.
It is undiluted MÃ¼ller-Armak.
Please send us the common positions.
Who actually controls economic policies?
Who represents the euro on the international stage?
These are the issues the Council has outstanding.
I congratulate the Presidency-in-Office on the success of Barcelona.
Congratulations are also due to the Spanish Government.
This has not proved the case.
Old habits die hard.
I should like to voice one last concern.
We should not be regressing.
Quite the opposite is needed.
That is what was lacking at the Barcelona Summit.
The end result is open coordination.
This procedure is highly undemocratic.
It amounts to a violation of the relevant treaties.
So who initiated this process?
The Nice Treaty in no way affects this status.
Thank you, Mr President.
That is the true civil society.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Barcelona produced results.
They are different issues.
And there were a few problems.
Thank you Mr Salafranca.
So, are the priorities the right ones?
This, however, is certainly not the case.
That should not be underestimated.
Ukraine is one of those countries.
In Russia too the subject is discussed.
Perhaps he would have a moment to listen.
(Applause)
They have failed to safeguard jobs.
It is also, however, an institutional problem.
Major deficits still exist.
As I said, there are still considerable deficits.
You would give it your best shot.
Would a guide dog help?
And that is my message to you.
If so, that would be a clear improvement.
Fourthly, I want to address a factual matter.
That would be an enormous boost.
That is a matter which must be taken seriously.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The next item is the vote.
Motion for a resolution RC B5-0180/2002
It sends the public into raptures.
What am I not convinced by?
They announced this brilliant proposal publicly.
Bravo!
Well done!
.
This is a particularly daring role reversal.
.
.
What has become of self-determination?
.
This is where two opinions clash.
The price is too high in my opinion.
This is why I reject the outcome.
Citizens are fundamental to a democracy.
That concludes the explanations of vote
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 7.25 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is to take place at 12.30 p.m.
Thank you, Mr Murphy.
Tuesday:
But of course the discharge is a joint vote.
No one wishes to speak against.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Tuesday:
As democrats, we accept that.
It is an important part of our work.
We cannot cancel Questions to the Commission.
It is, though, increasingly becoming the rule.
We shall now proceed with two votes:
(Parliament gave its assent)
(Parliament voted in favour of Wednesday)
You are quite right, Mr Provan.
Wednesday:
Thursday:
(Parliament gave its assent)
(Parliament gave its assent)
That finalises the agenda.
Speeches on points of order
That is the good news.
His name was Joseba Andoni Urdaniz.
Two people were killed.
(The President cut off the speaker)
So she is a little behind the times.
That would be just as erroneous.
He makes two points.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Let us not now enter into a whole debate.
I think we have exhausted the subject.
They are two EU citizens.
They are two fully accredited human rights workers.
It is also unreliable, slow and inconsistent.
Article 4(3) is of crucial importance.
In addition, the UEFA has a major role.
I should like to call on them to cooperate.
We can, of course, defeat hooliganism.
Those banning orders also apply to international matches.
During Euro 1996, German fans arrived in Manchester.
We need to deal with hooliganism pro-actively not re-actively.
And then, what about the others?
What about the non-candidate countries?
The list goes on.
Incidentally, Mr Deprez' report is very good.
This is not so, as you well know.
They know that they are being monitored.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Sadly, that is not the case.
That is the first point.
Cooperation is the key to success.
It is a necessary measure.
I congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
These are specific projects and complementary measures.
.
The framework programme also highlights the concept of partnership.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the joint debate on:
The topic is an exciting one.
I will break these down into a few points.
This clause is included in title VI.
This enables Member States themselves to determine the punishment.
This directive amounts to a fine balancing act.
This is a positive step.
This is convincingly supported in Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report.
That must come to an end.
Such concerns are groundless.
None of these things is envisaged.
Both reports contribute significantly to an important European-Union-level debate.
Both proposals pursue the same objective.
The Commission is not seeking an interinstitutional conflict.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
It rejects the Commission's proposal in its entirety.
There is your answer.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The next item is the joint debate on:
Using the word in another way undermines it completely.
That is something we must avoid at all costs.
They can simply stay in Turkey or Russia.
rapporteur.
We could have a long list of those countries.
Just a few words on enlargement.
This poses a real challenge.
These are serious, practical problems.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
Not many, I hope.
Thank you very much, Mrs Klamt.
The Commission proposal is a brave one.
The most important innovations are:
Thank you for your cooperation.
That was not to be the case.
What was lacking was a common approach.
Allow me to mention a number of important points.
These are people we are dealing with!
It may be a country they have heard of.
They might have family links there.
It might offer work opportunities.
It might be because of former colonial ties.
There might be a language link.
There are all sorts of reasons.
By doing this, you will only promote immigration.
What this is about is help for refugees.
Under no circumstances could we accept that.
I only hope that we will all do likewise.
I hope we will all succeed in doing that.
It also confuses asylum with immigration.
The asylum system is based on urgently needing protection.
This would cover the Sangatte Centre near Calais.
One month is the absolute maximum in humane terms.
The concept of custody must be clearly defined.
What is the nuclear family?
The directive on family unity must be swiftly implemented.
However, we do not have this single system.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
Thank you very much, Mr Di Lello Finuoli.
I have taken note of your comment.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
I should like this put on record.
Thank you, Mr Wynn.
We were the lucky ones.
I understand the President of Parliament was also affected.
We shall notify the French Government.
(The Minutes were approved)
I would like to make two further observations.
Mrs Frahm, you asked to take the floor.
This is something that should have been rejected.
The next item is the joint debate on:
Section IV, Court of Justice
Section V, Court of Auditors
Section VI, Economic and Social Committee
Section VII, Committee of the Regions
Section VIII, Ombudsman
and
Section VI, Economic and Social Committee
Section II, Council
2000 Discharge: Section III of the General Budget
I am going to mention its principal features.
That figure requires some explanation.
Another factor is the reserve of EUR 800 million.
It should not be included in the surplus.
The new Commission came in at that time.
So, there was a problem.
We have set out our solutions in paragraph 44.
We have failed to do that so far.
In fact, it has done so.
The Commission then found a few more reports.
I then asked for a list of these audits.
That is something we cannot live with.
It borrowed and lent money.
Its credit balance exceeds its debts.
That is only reasonable.
That would seem to be a large number.
Parliament can endorse their opinion.
Parliament's accounts are abstruse, however.
They must therefore wield their power.
.
We grant discharge to the Court of Justice.
We grant discharge to the Ombudsman.
We grant discharge to the Committee of the Regions.
Do we see some duplication here for example?
Try telling that to the taxpayers of Europe!
This situation is a disgrace.
I turn finally very briefly to the Council.
The challenge in Kosovo after the war was enormous.
Your criticism is one that I share.
This really does raise some very serious issues.
I have several reasons for picking up on this.
They were on the spot themselves.
We need to be able to indicate that.
We should not give money to bad projects.
So we have a double problem there.
My final point concerns the trans-European networks.
Parliament's Secretary-General bears personal responsibility for this.
These we have to sort out ourselves.
It is a step that we must take.
This is difficult for the many agencies.
This too would simplify inspection by Parliament.
Another point concerns the clearance of accounts.
The 'gentlemen's agreement' no longer applies.
I should like to quote from two recitals.
Financial management and the legislation itself are unacceptably bad.
People will simply not put up with it.
This cannot be the price of cooperation in Europe.
The management of the Structural Funds requires substantial improvement.
The complex Community regulations must be simplified.
Would the Commission map this out for us soon?
This is not the right approach.
This is the seventh year running.
This is not a record to be proud of.
The buck stops with the Commission.
Things have got to change.
There are still some problems, however.
We believe that the Council discharge should be approved.
Foreign and defence policy are recent issues.
Why do I link that with the budget debate?
So it is relevant to refer to this.
Let me emphasise that again.
This instrument is evidently not that fully applicable.
How, then, is that to be done?
This was agreed in Berlin.
Mr McCartin is right to recommend the discharge.
We must take steps to correct this imbalance.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
It should be reasonable, yet unyielding.
This is a key point for us too.
Most air traffic accidents are due to human factors.
We do, of course, support this idea.
National pride must make way for rational cooperation.
A lot is moving in the skies above Europe.
The restructuring of air transport is in full swing.
Safety aspects of airports are also to be included.
That is our objective.
Well-organised, sole responsibility is the key word.
We have already waited too long.
It is a powerful symbol.
Consequently, the Commission cannot accept this amendment.
The Commission can fully support the other amendments.
The Commission does not object to this.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The sitting is adjourned until Question Time.
(Members rose and observed one minute's silence)
Why?
Thank you very much.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Schmitt report (A5-0093/2002)
Ebner (PPE-DE).
Tomorrow, therefore, we must vote for this document.'
President.
I really would like to thank the rapporteur.
Otherwise, the report is excellent.
.
I am pleased that Amendment No 21 did.
Unfortunately the Belgian authorities refused to use that.
.
.
Why is that?
.
Support refugees!
The majority was fortunately rejected.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
This is not a minor point.
I was trying to explain what had happened.
I was not able to do that.
In plenary session that represents a precedent.
That is an important contribution.
I want to thank the Minister of the Council.
The second principle is that of mission speciality.
We have had the opportunity to witness this shortcoming.
We are also participating in eight other panels.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
This is true also of arms policy.
We must enforce a common standard of security.
It is not always easy.
These problems are not insoluble.
Hands up!
Mr Brok also mentioned the question of standardisation.
We must not switch roles.
These are mainly due to differing views on security.
The cooperation model is paramount.
The US sees things differently in many cases.
Having military power and its possible use are paramount.
This is untenable in the long run.
Unfortunately, this is still not the case.
Gentlemen, a warm welcome to you.
Thank you.
.
Cross-border crime could be combated through Interpol.
My group has another vision for Europe.
The EU is the world's strongest trading block.
We still do not have a European armaments agency.
We want the Commission to move forward.
Why only a third?
We need somebody with responsibility.
Member States do remain ultimately responsible, though.
What does Europe actually want from its defence policy?
The interests of the individual Member States weigh heavily.
In general, European projects do not run smoothly.
Every military conflict has a history.
Commissioner Patten has presented us with a challenge.
This marks real progress.
You touched on this point, Minister.
But there is wastage.
I support those broad objectives.
Quite right!
That is an open secret.
That is what security, efficiency and thrift dictate.
Fortunately, we have learnt from experience.
So progress is being made.
It was demonstrated a moment ago why that is.
That goes without saying.
We have no guarantee of any such complete concurrence.
I am not sure what.
But I cannot go any further into this issue.
You ask about relations with NATO.
Secondly, missions.
The Commission will continue to follow this line.
I think he is willing to answer your question.
I am very happy to do so.
That concludes the joint debate.
(Loud applause)
And these clear resolutions must be applied immediately.
(Applause)
I have had the opportunity to speak to them.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We will organise the detail of that.
How have we come to this?
Since then we have seen appalling destruction and misery.
They are wrong at every time in every place.
Wrong always, wrong everywhere!
(Applause)
(Applause)
It is clear that there are no easy solutions.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
The alternative to the Palestinian Authority is Palestinian anarchy.
Is that what the leaders of Israel really want?
(Applause)
(Loud and sustained applause)
The killing must end immediately.
(Applause)
The West does have levers of pressure.
You, Mr Solana, must employ them.
(Applause)
All the hospital buildings have been destroyed.
Women are dying in childbirth, their babies too.
There is also a curfew in force in Bethlehem.
There was the sound of constant gunfire.
We decided to accompany worshippers to church.
They are already without electricity.
They expect so much from Europe.
They are pinning all their hopes on us.
We must make some genuine proposals.
We would always greet one another.
'Kiffech' he would say to me.
'Mapsuta' I would reply.
Are these normal scenes of war?
We must not lose our humanity.
The tragedy is two-fold.
I am not taking sides.
Few tears are shed for them.
That is all well and good.
But what are we going to ask Yasser Arafat?
There is talk of economic retaliation against Israel.
There can be no such balance.
What can we do?
A great deal, I believe.
Let me quote:
The EU too must do more, however.
An immediate weapons embargo?
Yes.
Obviously, the Association Agreement must be discussed.
A Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state.
The Oslo spirit is dead.
Israel is guilty of state terrorism.
The EU must now suspend the Association Agreement.
The proclamation of an arms embargo is not sufficient.
There is another requirement, in addition to these.
We should take advantage of that.
I wish you all every success tomorrow.
Fine words and self-praise, but no action.
Words alone, however, are not enough!
This is the only option we have left.
No conflict can be solved through terrorism and violence.
Accordingly both sides must end this violent conflict.
Israel must withdraw from the Palestinian areas.
The acts of terror by the Palestinians must cease.
We need to make demands of both sides.
They are moderates or radicals.
We must take concrete and appropriate action now.
The situation was desperate then.
Since then the security situation has deteriorated catastrophically.
But I hold no brief for Ariel Sharon.
Time is running out.
This means that we all shoulder our responsibilities.
Mr President, time is running out.
For both the Palestinians and the Israelis.
It is time for action, initiative and intervention.
Any further prevarication is pointless and destructive.
You know what I mean.
I repeat: without delay.
That is what we must do.
That is the final objective.
How can that objective be achieved?
(Applause)
We must understand all of this.
(Applause)
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon on Wednesday.
At the moment, the scope is relatively restricted.
That goes without saying.
We save lives and we protect the marine environment.
In particular the black box voyage-data recorder.
The rapporteur has been very cautious.
Thank you very much, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I believe we have achieved this.
Firstly, the role of the national patent authorities.
Secondly, the legal question.
Nevertheless, it is a good result.
I regard that as a good proposal.
Please excuse me and thank you for your attention.
Then I should like to mention the jurisdiction.
That would be a great pity.
The Union should pay for that.
It should not become a cost to patent holders.
In particular they want a cheap and user-friendly regime.
He has a UK patent.
This is one of our priorities.
Needless to say, we endorse a Community patent.
So what is the current situation?
They are the ones waiting for the patent.
My congratulations.
Finally, jurisdiction.
Mr President.
Moreover, European industry has called for this.
This is a compromise solution.
These amendments refer to the national patent offices.
Here two different issues are involved.
It would put a heavy burden on its cost-effectiveness.
That is the first issue.
I remind Parliament that we have been here before.
The Commission would like to accept Amendment No 34.
That already exists.
That pleads for a centralised Community jurisdiction.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The answer is relatively simple.
That is why collective financing is needed here.
It is precisely that which is not consumer-friendly.
There is then no third-party control.
That just cannot be right.
A ten-year-old fridge is an incredible power-guzzler.
I hope that you will agree with me.
We have brought this forward from 2008 to 2006.
Thank you very much, Mr Florenz.
I cannot do anything about it either!
No, we are not.
Do we have similar estimates from other countries?
No, we do not.
Will they legislate without counting the cost?
Yes, in all probability they will.
Not yet.
Fifthly, are we being fair to local authorities?
No, the amendments ignore them.
No.
Parliament habitually increases targets - any targets.
Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
We strongly support the principle of producer responsibility.
I thought we were all agreed on that point.
Thank you, Mr President.
This is modern environmental policy.
This is new.
We Greens were on our own with our plea.
Individual producer responsibility.
Electrolux in Sweden deserves credit in this respect.
There is a collective system in the Netherlands.
This system encourages laziness in producers.
That does not work.
For example, small manufacturers should be included.
Thank you, Mr President.
I support the thrust of his approach.
The separate collection of these is not environmentally effective.
Two of these are of particular concern to me.
But are these proposals going to help us?
Eight kilos of WEEE waste per person is collected.
There must be no benefit from throwing things away.
Here I welcome the amendment on orphan waste products.
Otherwise we will simply have chaos.
One final word about Finland.
We support all amendments that reinforce the environmental objective.
However, individual funding is not the answer.
Individual funding will therefore hardly benefit the environment.
My second point concerns the waste disposal fee.
Why should this not be visible?
What about small and medium-sized enterprises?
I thank all Members for this important debate.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
This is certainly a highly important area.
This is an interesting issue.
These substances are dangerous, they are toxic.
There is absolutely no question about that fact.
Will the risk assessments finally rule out its use?
We want this issue resolved.
For the moment it is an open question.
That took place in November of last year.
These substances are persistent and bioaccumulative.
There is no reason to wait any longer.
There are substitutes.
So how quickly is it prepared to act?
The directive is based on the precautionary principle.
Suitable measures can then be taken immediately.
I should like to thank MEPs for this debate.
Thank you very much, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The two hydrogens need to be deleted.
(The sitting was closed at 11.37 p.m.)
Situation in Chechnya
There should be no doubt about this.
More must be done here.
This is becoming a more and more serious issue.
...
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
This is a political issue.
Obviously, atrocities are being committed on both sides.
Their situation is, of course, incredibly precarious.
There is, of course, no military solution.
This was also confirmed by the Russian ambassador.
This would be all too simplistic.
Parliament has asked you twice to visit Chechnya.
We will go together.
Terrorism does not come about of itself.
Terrorists do not fall from the sky.
We are talking about outright genocide.
We are talking about genocide.
This is the situation in Chechnya.
It is genocide.
This was also provided for in Russian policy.
What did we ultimately see?
A failed state emerged, which is a disaster.
This is a disaster which we are facing.
Then a war breaks out.
It is not like that in this case.
Human rights are in our line of business.
We should make it our concern.
This is why our resolution is full of questions.
Why have our actions lacked punch up until now?
Atrocities grow, they do not diminish.
Conflict goes on for years.
When wars continue, humanity loses its purpose.
This war must end.
Mr President, I agree with Mr Cashman.
This makes us guilty of these crimes too.
(Applause)
This is also true of the situation in Chechnya.
A change of thinking is required.
Conflicts and terrorism cannot be resolved by military means.
We should support this.
The human rights situation in Chechnya remains critical.
We need to trust both sides.
They are systematic.
We must not stand for this any longer.
We are all prepared to support this proposal.
This is not a war on terrorism.
Suspected terrorists were shot in their slippers.
We have every right to oppose this colonial war.
We have a special partnership with Russia.
We are both members of the OSCE.
We are both members of the Council of Europe.
This is all propaganda.
No one is investigating these crimes.
We must not stand for this any longer!
Thank you, Commissioner.
I will now comment on the amendments.
I would therefore remain opposed to these amendments.
I am obviously referring to Resolutions 1397 and 1402.
I am therefore in favour of Amendment No 10.
I think that it should come after paragraph 22.
After enlargement, that is our political priority.
Thirdly, we need a human rights policy.
Otherwise, we will be throwing our money away.
We should also keep Western Sahara in mind.
Unemployment increases unexpectedly and peasants flock to the cities.
They then fail to find work.
This in turn boosts emigration, illegal or otherwise.
Furthermore, this is clearly not the only approach.
This should involve strengthening Euro-Mediterranean dialogue.
Closed border situations in diplomatic relations cannot continue.
This has to be bridged.
It has the resources that are needed.
The bombings and killings must stop.
The settlements must be dismantled.
Israel must respect the United Nations' resolutions.
These are all matters of extreme urgency.
The mission to the Middle East did take place.
That was a success in itself.
Further, it succeeded in retaining its dignity.
So what is the way ahead?
How can we raise the profile of the partnership?
We hope to reach a final consensus in Valencia.
Economically, signs are encouraging.
We are catching up.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Mr Esteve, you asked for the floor.
.
Quite the opposite is the case.
We shall now take the next item.
The debate will be concluded this afternoon.
rapporteur.
It is important to promote exchanges of all kinds.
Under-development is no excuse here.
We have received very many well-founded allegations of torture.
Torture must be eliminated.
We also want China to fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria.
Things could then become unsettled in China.
Certainly we can be cautious.
This also applies to the death penalty.
Instability would be the result.
These are, in themselves, promising signs.
Thank you very much, Mr Belder.
The debate is now adjourned.
We shall proceed to the vote.
I do not think that is acceptable.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 3.
This is Amendment No 4.
.
Thank you, Mr Blak.
Amendment No 41:
.
.
We went along with that.
It is opposed to the oral amendment.
.
I fully understand Mrs Morgan's objections.
First listen to what I have to say!
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause and heckling)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause)
I have listened carefully to what you have said.
We had the debate yesterday.
So let us move to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
No one coastal zone is the same as another.
.
1.
The environmental objectives should be paramount in these directives.
2.
In addition, producers must be individually responsible.
3.
My final point concerns the waste disposal fee.
Moreover, visibility enhances consumer awareness.
.
I too have been approached with reasonable sounding arguments.
.
.
This approach will enable us to avoid many problems.
This is merely a pretext, however.
The Council has sole responsibility for the CFSP.
I am very pleased with that.
This only undermines the credibility of Parliament.
Hence our opposition.
.
.
ESDP is a serious deviation from this concept.
I therefore voted against the resolution.
We must be consistent in our approach to terrorism.
.
They are as follows:
Â· to suspend the EU-Israeli Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement;
There is no military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
.
.
This is precisely what inflames the surrounding Arab peoples.
This is genocide.
Stop this hypocrisy!
Nevertheless, we must not abandon the Israeli people.
The resolution encourages desertion in the Israeli army.
We must act quickly.
There is no reason not to be fair.
Rather than rushing to condemn Israel again?
The situation in Chechnya is certainly tragic.
A cease-fire must be declared.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
The list goes on.
Unfortunately, this is a rhetorical question.
The same equally applies within the European Union.
Does that mean that it is all good news?
By no means.
And there are a lot of them!
It is a really good piece of work.
That will continue.
China has decided to join the World Trade Organisation.
That is not acceptable.
This would not be the first time.
This situation is ridiculous.
This is unacceptable.
We do not support this.
We condemn this behaviour.
We agree with this.
China also came a long way in that period.
We remain committed to the human rights dialogue.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
It is extremely important that we do this first.
Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo.
Pensions are one example of these.
That applies to men and women alike.
This too must be borne in mind.
Do something, Council!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Silence is a very relative concept.
This is really the limit.
We must avoid constricting rules that hamper existing schemes.
That is maybe cynical if truthful.
Clearly, the question of financing arises.
That would be irresponsible.
New resources must therefore be found.
The report certainly has good points.
There are legitimate, quite specific interests involved.
All the rest must be entrusted to funding mechanisms.
How should this be done?
What is this choice?
But we have given that commitment.
It bears no relation to contemporary society.
But that alone is not enough.
Public opinion is unprepared and uninformed.
The report is based on significant social phenomena.
We need solutions at both national and Union level.
Pension systems cannot be reformed in a vacuum.
There is an important point to be made here.
No, that is not enough.
Are there democratic lacunae?
Indeed there are!
Is there more room for cooperation with Parliament?
Indeed there is!
The cooperation method on pensions has only just begun.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
There is a tendency to overlook a fundamental issue.
Work always entails a risk.
No situation is free from risk.
Working with asbestos can be dangerous.
I should like to be very clear.
I appeal to the Commissioner on this.
We would also encourage administrations to collaborate amongst themselves.
I would also comment on the ban on asbestos.
I am entirely in favour of the report.
The evidence is there.
The facts are clear, based on scientific studies.
I genuinely believe that is a separate case.
I urge you to vote for this excellent report.
I will return to this point in a moment.
That is at any event what I have heard.
The EU should naturally cease such production.
Yet this committee knows better.
It thinks that the precautionary principle should apply.
Registers are bureaucratic and difficult to manage.
This is not very responsible.
However, I would like to highlight two points.
That too I see as being necessary.
I would like to thank him for his understanding.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
It is unfortunately often the case.
The debate is closed.
You have the floor.
Could I ask if that is the situation?
Parliament's deadline is 1 p.m. on 26 April.
Council's is 1 p.m. on 25 April.
This is what would have happened anyway.
Let us show some optimism for once.
As you already stated, our opinions differ.
All the institutions shut down for several days.
There simply has not been enough time.
I suggest we provide written replies.
You have the floor, Mr De Rossa.
We shall consider a number of questions.
Subject: Concept of marriage in the EU
Mr de Miguel has the floor.
Mr President, thank you for this clarification.
The Council cannot give an answer.
I am interested and I do know it.
Subject: Peace in the Middle East
Subject: Community programme for environmental education
Subject: Ratification of the Cotonou Agreement
I also think the time is just right.
Subject: Kashmir
They believe they can solve the conflict by themselves.
Subject: Visitor's visa for leading Taiwanese citizens
I see nothing strange in that, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m.
Subject: Action to unblock international adoptions in Romania
Subject: International adoptions and Romania
The question now asked is identical.
Unfortunately they have been blocked from doing so.
Mr President, my question will be very brief.
Subject: Extension of scope of SIS 2
More than 2 000 implements were confiscated.
This is not a point of order.
Mrs Izquierdo should be aware of this.
In fact, the opposite is the case.
Why do we need the risk capital action plan?
The framework for these benchmarks has now been identified.
The first is market fragmentation.
But look at some of the licensing issues.
Progress has been made but it is quite slow.
Nonetheless, his is a voice that we welcome.
His report is one that we welcome.
There have been such failures.
Who is making those judgments?
These are some of the cautions there may be.
They are pension funds, banks and insurance companies.
These promote the further development of new technology.
The incentives should therefore certainly be temporary in nature.
The second major area is the transfer of businesses.
Are the rules on depreciation right?
Investment almost tripled between 1998 and 2000.
Perhaps I may mention four of them.
Thirdly, entrepreneurship must be encouraged.
We do not want to see that happen.
We are now entering a third consultation round.
The Commission begs to differ.
Therefore the Commission regrets it cannot accept this amendment.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Is the Commission intending to withdraw the proposal?
The legal basis now in force makes this impossible.
The legal basis cannot be changed just like that.
We have to continue with things as they are.
The EU is in the process of enlarging.
Our demand that this be done was rejected.
We have kicked the ball back.
Mrs Jeggle has pointed this out.
Any new regulation must cover all types of alcohol.
So this sixth attempt is a real loss.
Please do not misunderstand me.
The Commission is working on that.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Protection of minors and human dignity
I commend the report to the House.
The system is also accompanied by an age category.
For them, we need money.
This also applies to other degrading and illegal activities.
This is not just about child pornography.
Less clear-cut evils are still evils.
.
We must increase the means available to these organisations.
That is the basic premise.
I see this as compellingly necessary.
I have seen the pictures.
With this they monitored chat channels for 16 hours.
Abuse is under-reported.
So what should we do in the EU?
We need to do more.
I want better research and funding for Internet-tracing software.
So many thanks for it.
Both sides must take full responsibility in this regard.
This is happening in a major city in France.
Our approach, therefore, is extremely practical.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The challenges we face are great.
For that, we need more mobility.
Such mobility greatly contributes to mutual understanding within Europe.
This is certainly very important for developing countries.
A society must be supported by its citizens.
Education plays an important role in integration.
This report is about cooperation with third countries.
The US is still far more appealing.
It is crucial for the advancement of a country.
I regret this and hope that it will change.
The rapporteur mentioned the ALFA programme.
We will be collaborating closely with them.
The high-level political decision exists.
We are however making progress here too.
My final point is languages.
This has set things moving.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Firstly, the population is ageing rapidly.
Nevertheless, demography is not a destiny.
We have identified the main challenges together.
There you are.
That is a cop-out.
The picture in the developing world is even worse.
However, that is not the case today.
Such are the ethics of the developed world.
We will now proceed to the vote.
Simplified procedure:
Before the vote:
Thank you, Commissioner.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
.
We support every improvement along those lines.
That right should also apply to human rights issues.
.
Anything to do with tackling terrorism is important.
.
There is clearly no legally tenable evidence against them.
That is especially important in the fight against terrorism.
These decisions are binding but can never be absolute.
There must be room for manoeuvre.
.
Nevertheless in some sectors the risk persists.
.
.
.
.
Tibet's cultural and religious autonomy is being denied.
The opposite is now true.
I can fully endorse his conclusion in this case.
.
The word 'support' may cause confusion.
This would have been more than enough.
Our pay-as-you-go pension systems are under threat.
For clearly identified demographic and economic reasons.
Everyone is aware of this.
But their salvation will not come from Brussels.
.
.
For these reasons, I voted against this report.
.
.
.
It imposes a different attitude towards ageing.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Moldova needs a new future.
We must act, and act together.
We find them unacceptable.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
She is still under house arrest in Burma.
This is great progress and we should encourage it.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Violation of human rights in Nigeria
Human rights situation in Guatemala
Channel Tunnel
A vicious circle indeed.
Such is the situation in Vietnam.
That is the Commission's position.
We have heard the voices of these victims.
In this way, democracy will also be strengthened.
That is the first measure.
This situation is unacceptable.
There are also very serious environmental and other consequences.
They are perfectly justified.
This is unacceptable.
The rail-freight operators are on the brink of collapse.
Eight thousand workers could be out of a job.
What exactly are we talking about here?
The refugees in Sangatte are not illegal immigrants.
There is something obscene about confusing the two.
What does this document say?
That way we are heading for a catastrophe.
The British Government must amend its approach to asylum.
These are desperate people.
I agree with Mrs Ludford and Mrs Roure here.
The traditional family is no longer the norm.
Putting this undertaking into practice means spending money.
Europe has a very important part to play.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 5.30 this evening.
Unita must be integrated into democratic life.
The very best of luck, Angola!
We must be at once optimistic and prudent.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
But we must also look at the further-reaching effects.
Their position is deplorable.
The joint debate is closed.
.
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
Resumption of the session
The next item is the order of business
Thank you very much, Mr President.
In Valencia we signed the agreement with Algeria.
What are these principles?
The realisation of the process requires initiatives.
Jenin is undoubtedly a dramatic example.
They must run in parallel.
I must say that that attitude has changed.
A peace conference cannot start from nothing.
(Applause)
Much remains to be done.
There is also a broader point.
We also agreed to step up our financial cooperation.
(Applause)
And failure to discourage this is quite simply inexcusable.
(Applause)
(Applause)
I want to make four points:
(Applause)
(Applause)
.
(Laughter and loud applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
This must stop.
(Applause)
But our resources are already stretched to the limits.
(Sustained applause)
(Applause)
That is what we have called for.
(Applause)
(Applause)
It is an absolutely fundamental principle.
We must be a bit more decisive.
Our partners must give us guarantees.
(Applause)
We must bring civilisation back to the area.
Israel must not be given special treatment.
That is paradoxical, in my view.
What can we do?
The rule of law must return to the area.
What about us though?
Are we doing enough?
I am asking a very simple question.
Are we not hypocrites?
Is that not the truth?
Let us now turn to the problem of Israel.
This was both fair and unfair.
We can do this immediately.
This is true.
The elections in Europe have shown us this.
(Applause)
To achieve peace, we must do more.
And why not?
This is one option.
Are we doing enough?
Have we really finished with all our contradictions?
We are neither Israelis nor Palestinians.
We are all Israeli-Palestinians or Palestinian-Israelis.
We must grasp this once and for all.
(Applause)
This applies to both sides.
(Applause)
This is what I am saying.
(Applause)
She was later found riddled with bullets.
We do not know what happened to them.
There is a name for this sort of violence.
It bears all the hallmarks of war crimes.
We must react, because impunity encourages arrogance.
This is what causes violence and conflict.
The difficulty, however lies in bringing them together.
Each side must give up something.
I can fully endorse this view.
This can only be condemned.
Domine dona nobis pacem.
[Grant us peace, Lord].
(Interruption by the President)
Mr Larsson is entirely right.
Jenin can be called Palestine's ground zero.
Jenin can also be called a new Deir Yassin.
The Sharon regime must be isolated.
Happily, there are many who realise this.
Stop the military occupation!'
Now we must turn words into tangible actions.
We must use the instruments available to us too.
We know what we are asking Israel.
And what a vision this is!
I believe this would make a real difference.
That must be stopped.
Some years after Barcelona this seems absolutely clear.
The Israeli Government is not only fighting terrorism.
Loathsome suicide attacks are then the end result.
How is this supposed to guarantee Israel's security?
It is not just a question of Jenin.
The horror is also political.
The Palestinian Authority is completely destroyed.
Wealth next to misery.
We witnessed this the day before yesterday.
That is the issue for the European Union.
To terrorise a population is pure State terrorism.
We have the exact figures from human rights organisations.
More than 2 000 civilians have been killed.
We know how many of them are children.
Marriages are not being registered.
He is now being held in detention.
He is my colleague.
He is under the same immunity as myself.
Let us tell it like it is.
Let us not make any assumptions.
There is evidence enough.
Your statement, Mr President, was balanced.
I hope we do not.
He does not take them seriously!
They play into Ariel Sharon's hands.
They regard us with distrust, rightly or wrongly.
What will our exit strategy from trade sanctions be?
There have been many resolutions and conferences.
They harbour ideas of national splendour.
They harbour anti-Semitic ideas.
They harbour xenophobic ideas.
And what will the upshot be?
Was what we did on such occasions enough?
Is what we always do on such occasions enough?
Have you ever checked up on it?
Can you give Parliament evidence of it?
This applies to Europe and the Middle East alike.
The violence and the killing must stop.
I do not think so.
Look at Cuba.
Look at Iraq.
Have Castro and Saddam Hussein been weakened?
Hardly.
Who is it who have to suffer?
It is not Ariel Sharon.
Is this information correct?
Is the same thing happening in other countries?
You said that all alternatives are open?
What do you mean by that?
I am puzzled by the Council's excessive caution.
I say 'excessive' caution.
I appeal for urgent aid in that regard.
I have no doubt about that at all.
There are many other conditions we could perhaps apply.
There is no problem about an exit strategy.
Does this Parliament want such a bank?
Do our partners in the southern Mediterranean want this?
Do certain members of the Council?
Are we seeing history repeat itself?
Single-handedly he has caused his country's political isolation.
How can the EU help?
Let us stop being polite and politically correct.
We have been gagged for all this time.
They want peace now.
That is what Israel has to pull back to.
How are we to deal with their existence?
What do I find most disturbing?
These camps are extremely dangerous breeding grounds.
I am also a candid friend of Israel.
Our task is one of persuasion.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Thank you very much, Mr Alyssandrakis.
This, of course, affects our moral authority.
The little statistical data that is available is alarming.
Our decision was unanimous.
Why?
That is what these two reports do brilliantly.
Why?
At the same time, what happens?
That is the reality of human rights abuses.
We need to be global.
We need to be expansive.
That is the reality.
That is something we have repeated many times.
Few of these proposals become a reality.
Terrorism and human rights are topical subjects too.
What is such a bureau meant to do?
What mandate is it to have?
We must speak with one voice.
Only then can the EU obtain real influence.
It is just empty talk.
We have not done that.
It is not enough to know 'who'.
We must also know 'why'.
We have problems with our policy in the EU.
We need to put an end to this hypocrisy.
The EU is not powerless.
We can in actual fact make a difference.
We are not powerless.
Let us use the influence and power we have.
Lofty ideals and expressions of goodwill are not enough.
Firstly, we must be cautious.
This initiative has been a success.
The Commission then took on the whole process in-house.
These are political projects, they need political oversight.
A rigid code of conduct is not effective.
We speak of 'the rights of man'.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Slavery is not a thing of the past.
Such resignation is dangerous for democracy itself.
That is not consonant with human dignity.
This is not true.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
It was the Costa Neves report.
So I am the in-between bit.
I think they would be unwise to do that.
As I said SAB 3 is coming.
There are other consequences.
They are right.
We are talking about poor execution and poor management.
This is not good news for anyone concerned.
Political life is a life of negotiation.
Perhaps so many payment appropriations are not necessary.
The effort needed for 2003 will perhaps be greater.
It will particularly benefit the EU's net contributors.
It is difficult to put decisions into effect.
These imbalances are largely concentrated in category 2.
We will have a very rapid cut-off.
(Interruption: Very good!)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The problem in this field is obvious to everyone.
These can often be of major significance.
Finally, the Regulation in question lapses in 2003.
We are nowhere near approaching that.
That is why my group supports both reports.
They cannot.
That is something we cause them to believe.
My group will support the report.
What do I mean by the individualisation of rights?
I think that this is our future.
We want the transposition of the acquis.
We know that it is very difficult.
Women suffer heavily from domestic violence.
The situation is too appallingly unfair for this.
However, we need to do more.
I believe we are familiar enough with the problem.
There really have to be some changes here.
Let me take the first point.
Let me turn to the second point.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
We have done the right thing.
We shall remember that pledge.
Partnerships are the way forward in this area.
It requires targeted support for local efforts.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Mr President, this is a splendid evening.
Why is that the case?
The PPE-DE Group suggested 0.8 m/s2.
We have achieved a worthwhile compromise.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11 p.m.)
Fishing fleets
I welcome Mr Kindermann's work in this area.
This is worrying and must be rectified.
I welcome Mr Kindermann highlighting this.
Reductions in the fleet are thus essential.
The fleet structure is secondary to this.
Which countries exceed their quotas?
This is also confirmed in the Kindermann report.
This is unacceptable.
I agree with your sixth and tenth points.
There is a need for improvements to on-board safety.
I accept your eighth point as well.
Your ninth point, too, we accept wholeheartedly.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
This is not realistic.
We are therefore facing a new phenomenon.
(Applause from the left)
They want refugee status.
We need measures to combat misuse.
That we do not want!
That is not the policy that we support.
We reject what your side is coming up with.
We do not want more Le Pens in Europe.
Social protection is therefore included.
My second point concerns education.
This is of major importance.
We may get another chance.
Lanzarote is not the only example.
There are many more.
Precisely the opposite is the case.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Applause from the right and from the centre)
The issue we are discussing is extremely serious.
(Applause from the right)
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you, Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­.
We shall do as you have asked.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
The next item is the joint debate on:
This is a brief overview of the situation.
The United States gives USD 10 billion.
This has been a Conference of contrasts.
Efforts must be made across a broad front.
The level of ambition must be higher, however.
This is all about very large sums of money.
How do you intend to accomplish this?
This is clear from the Monterrey Conference too.
What a paradox this is!
We must, therefore, cancel this debt.
We must cancel the debt now.
We no longer have surplus mountains.
What we have is balanced production.
Thank you, Commissioner.
These amendments contravene the principle of subsidiarity.
.
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.
.
The European system would therefore have automatic self-regulation.
This exclusion then becomes an instrument for discouraging newcomers.
.
We are discussing human rights in the European Union.
The far right gained 20% of the votes.
We must radically change European politics.
.
This approach receives my support.
.
Let us take some practical action at last!
Enough of words, words, words!
This paragraph read as follows:
- (NL) Europe is wealthy and powerful.
Europe is partly responsible for these problems.
Mr President, last night I had a dream.
.
.
.
That concludes the votes.
Resumption of the session
That is precisely the basis of our democratic system.
President.
They were given very severe sentences.
The sentences were totally disproportionate.
I shall do that on behalf of the House.
This has a serious impact on another Member State.
Perhaps you could let me know.
(Applause)
The Minutes will so record.
You are right, Mrs BerÃ¨s.
We will do so.
Obviously the immediate objective is to terrorise voters.
Does that make everything shipshape?
Unfortunately not yet.
This too will need to be provided for.
We must ourselves be as open as possible.
We are an open institution with open meetings.
There is scope for interpretation in these areas.
This is a key point.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow.
These attacks were against the Nation States.
Terrorism has taken on a new dimension.
I urge the Council to listen to Parliament.
We are very disappointed with the Council, though.
We have a counter-example.
Allow me to make two observations.
That is simply not on.
Distortion of competition must be avoided.
The Commission should promptly develop proposals in this respect.
We also support the principle of random inspections.
These have a preventive effect.
Exceptions should be kept to a minimum.
Flexibility is needed here.
It is important.
The Commission insists on the urgency of this document.
I would classify the amendments in four categories.
We believe that that would provide the appropriate balance.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The directive applies to all consumers.
The directive provides for a period of fourteen days.
These fourteen calendar days seem acceptable, however.
But what do we find?
What sort of single market will we create?
It is not satisfactory.
It is a course of events that baffles me.
Why?
And I would ask you to bear with me.
This met with a great deal of resistance.
This happened in 1995.
The European Commission was in agreement with this.
Then, a Green Paper was published in 1997.
We voted in favour of this.
Why maximum harmonisation?
Moreover, this also benefits the financial sector.
What transpired?
This is a sensible requirement and we support it.
We therefore ask you to adopt our amendments.
Do consumers read the information?
Do they take it on board?
Do they understand it?
Allow me to comment on the 50 amendments tabled.
This makes sense legally and in practice.
Again, I must disagree with these proposed amendments.
Amendment No 17 would render Amendment No 7 meaningless.
Consumers must pay for services rendered if they withdraw.
A good example is an insurance contract.
I have covered the most important amendments.
The directive has been negotiated since 1998.
Thank you for your attention.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has requested the floor.
Good.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The existing directive is Directive 987 of 1980.
This is a huge step forward in my view.
I look forward to statements by the Commissioner.
This is a step in the right direction.
That is not acceptable.
It is a false flexibility.
New types of employment are emerging.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
We are not looking for new Treaty competences.
Tourism policy often gives a fragmented and chaotic impression.
Tourism contributes 5% of the EU's GDP.
The fault lies squarely with the Member State governments.
Certainly in those circumstances, prudence is called for.
Recent events in aviation have illustrated this.
This puts such heritage under extreme pressure.
A sector which mainly comprises medium-sized and small businesses.
All authorities involved have their own part to play.
What are their reasons for this?
Tourism is important for growth.
The same, I imagine.
You would have put health first.
Various other committees gave their opinion.
I thank you for this very constructive debate.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The programme was financed by the PHARE budgetary framework.
I think that this is what is most important.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Such a thing cannot be had for free.
We need a green light for the White Paper.
Citizenship is learned and put into practice through action.
Top jobs are mainly held by men.
The ball is now in the Council's court.
These priorities were identified during consultations with young people.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Why do we have to engage in such contortions?
Sport has always crossed national boundaries.
So there is sport in Europe.
So there is sport in Europe.
We went along with the proposal as regards finance.
Thus we have been very successful in some programmes.
We made an exception to this for evaluation.
I thought this was a brilliant idea.
The Council is against it.
We are grateful that it has at last arrived!
Sport plays a fundamental role in this integration.
The galleries are empty.
Discussion must range far and wide.
We should take it as our example.
Sport is movement!
Maybe this is overrating it a little.
Sound initiatives should be followed up.
What will be in the programme to address this?
No one should be excluded.
Sport is therefore an important factor in emancipation.
It was about time.
[It was worth it in the end.]
Let us hope so!
Why was it successful?
It enabled us to make progress.
We cannot therefore impose such partnerships from above.
Formal training and non-formal education must be combined.
The year 2004 is an Olympic year.
Thank you for your help.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 9.40 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
I therefore put the motion to the vote.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
The hearing emphasised the importance of these qualifications.
We wish him every success.
Thank you, Mr Karas.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
We reiterated our commitment to basic research.
Commissioner Busquin is expected to confirm this later.
I am extremely pleased about that.
This is one part of the European research area.
Member States must do the rest.
It is their responsibility.
The European Union is doing its part.
My last point concerns ethics.
A balanced, well-thought-out approach is what is required.
He considered them in a professional and sensitive manner.
This will not happen again.
The work is not finished.
We must not disappoint them.
I wish him great success in implementing this programme.
We have achieved a compromise on the ethics issue.
The next point relates to health.
Electronic networks for research is an additional point.
My final point concerns ethical considerations.
This is such an incredibly sensitive issue.
We must continue with these efforts.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
This is an increase over the previous year.
Thank you very much!
(Applause)
.
It is nonetheless important to make some introductory observations.
That is, in fact, progress.
Let us begin this discussion in time.
.
This sum amounts to EUR 51 million.
Allow me finally to make a short technical correction.
How will we fund measures to tackle it?
Commissioner Schreyer also made a reference to pensions.
This fact alone has a major impact on costs.
Surely it is time that Parliament has one seat.
This is the wrong way to provide finance.
There is no question here of unforeseen expenditure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
.
We need competition in products and competition in systems!
Europe needs a more innovative policy for growth.
This is true of passenger transport and freight transport.
Trans-European networks must receive European financing.
Public and private finance is necessary.
This is our fundamental dilemma.
That means that the two are linked together.
The reforms need to be speeded up.
The debate will resume this evening at 9 p.m.
It rejects the other amendments.
A mistake has been made.
You are changing the vote around and reversing it.
Before the vote:
This is the only solution that is correct.
I ask colleagues to approve it.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
The CFP has been an unmitigated environmental disaster.
.
We have come a long way since then.
The fight goes on.
.
I nonetheless voted against Mrs Maij-Weggen's report.
Official documents and working documents are quite different things.
.
Why is that?
'What are you doing here, notary?'
I asked him.
'You can hardly be described as a pensioner!'
.
How could I do otherwise?
This protection is, however, scandalously limited.
.
It is written on many clocks.
The Torres Marques report is on European tourism.
Why this name?
However, I should like to add the following:
.
.
.
This is why I fully endorse this report.
.
That is the first question which springs to mind.
.
.
.
Well, I had another dream last night.
.
Another Maastricht illusion bites the dust!
This building could become a European university.
I suggest we call it the Fatuzzo University.
The costs, however, are not only financial.
So do I.
We make ourselves a laughing-stock.
We are like a travelling theatre company.
The cost is enormous.
A Fatuzzo institute is a really excellent idea.
It is a question of political dignity.
Obviously, changes need to be made.
The Brussels part-sessions must be given real dignity.
That means that we must make savings.
It leads to inefficiency and waste.
This plan has borne fruit, ladies and gentlemen.
It is proven that illegality leads to marginalisation.
I am referring to cooperation with Parliament.
You tell me that there have been results.
I would like to ask you what they are.
Indeed, our prosperity will depend on immigration.
No wonder public concern continues to grow.
It is one we would do well to consider.
(Applause from the public galleries)
Ironically, all these measures are described as progress.
That is something we do not want!
That is something we do not need!
(Applause from the right)
The opposite is true, however.
(Applause from the right)
Those were my initial comments.
Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on
I will comment briefly on all of these issues.
In December 2001 the first informal meeting took place.
Another issue is that of scientific and technological cooperation.
But what about content?
Is the intense programme of EU-Russia meetings making progress?
My answer is yes, albeit slowly.
Our position remains simple and clear.
We condemn terrorism world-wide, including in Chechnya.
I want to make one final, simple point.
There is no other sensible option.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Madam President, thank you for your kind words.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Thank you very much indeed!
Thank you very much, Erika!
(Applause)
Thank you, Mrs Hoff.
(Applause)
I think that needs saying, in all honesty.
That means overcoming certain obstacles.
(Applause)
Just five points, ladies and gentlemen.
What is actually happening in Kaliningrad?
What is in fact happening in the energy dialogue?
We are waiting for results.
In my view, she deserves a mention here.
How is this possible, Mr MiguÃ©lez?
I do not understand.
Business as usual.
We have talked about the economy.
I implore you to do this.
Mrs Hoff is extremely skilled in this area.
Kaliningrad is not Konigsberg any more.
After all, many of the restrictions are man-made.
Many thanks and I wish her all the best.
A joint action plan also needs a joint fund.
The Chechnya conflict is of course a major problem.
The Presidency takes the same view.
Russia is now our neighbour.
, Council.
Unfortunately, we have many examples of this.
Thank you very much, Mr Schulz.
Thank you very much.
Three particular issues are worth stressing.
Instead, I will focus on more recent developments.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
Part I
Subject: Delay in the CFP reform proposals
.
We have now made good progress with our work.
One last comment.
To suggest anything else would be quite wrong.
I should like to ask a follow-up question.
I applaud any such effort.
We have waited for this reform package for years.
Our fishermen are suffering.
The first was about timetabling.
That much is clear.
.
There will be another time to debate fisheries policy.
Subject: Child athletes
.
.
Has the Commission given preferential treatment to business?
What role did the European Services Network play?
Is there not some contradiction here?
Subject: Preparations for the GATS negotiations
For now, we are at the reflection stage.
None of these organisations have been given special treatment.
To summarise, these leaks are indeed thoroughly regrettable.
Naturally, I refute any statements of this nature.
This is the general principle.
This is indeed a complex matter.
The difference cannot be remedied solely with public funds.
They decide for themselves what the public sector represents.
Then comes the question of quantity: how much?
.
Second part
Questions to Commissioner Schreyer
Subject: Implementation of the budget
.
The most recent update was in April 2002.
I also have a final question for Mrs Schreyer.
.
Thank you very much, Mrs Schreyer.
Questions to Commissioner Busquin
Can the Commission confirm this assertion?
At least, this is how I understood it.
I thank him for his response.
I am talking about Article 17 of the Treaty.
That takes care of the research programme.
Subject: Member State constitutions and the Sixth Framework Programme
This is absolutely essential.
This is the approach that we are taking.
It is very important.
That is not my understanding of the situation.
Subject: Work of the European Group on Ethics
These are problems for society.
Thank you, Mr Busquin.
Questions to Commissioner Verheugen
Subject: Protection of Roma from racial discrimination in Europe
But what are we doing?
We cannot speak for them.
.
Subject: Cyprus
.
.
We are not refusing to trade.
.
The Helsinki Strategy remains equally valid.
But my question was more specific than your reply.
These negotiations may finish in June.
On the other hand, they may not.
That was my specific question.
.
Every word I used was important.
Subject: Benes Decree of 19 May 1945
.
The Commission regards it as being obsolete.
.
So why not in the EU?
But public-sector investment also needs to increase.
I think that is worth considering.
I have considerable regard for Bruno Trentin but?
(The President cut the speaker off)
I shall make two points.
Otherwise, what we are doing is pointless.
I believe that it is absolutely essential.
Mr Jonckheer expressed this concern this morning.
My second comment is directed to Mrs BerÃ¨s.
The joint debate is closed.
.
Parliament will not agree to any change here.
Most producers nowadays operate on an international basis.
The debate on this in Parliament was very lively.
.
This is neither unusual nor anything special.
I hope that will be taken into account.
I support everything that the two rapporteurs have said.
The internal market must be founded on common rules.
Hence my warm support for the Commission's proposals.
Secondly, we must realise what we are doing.
These emotions are often there for a good reason.
In this sense, over-regulation has the opposite effect.
Moreover, we must create room for national cultures.
There should be a choice.
HACCP was not designed with farming in mind.
Here too, HACCP is an aid.
It is not a goal in itself.
A third comment concerns hunting.
However, there are limits.
For this, fair and thorough checks are required.
Food safety is a world task.
Training for workers is important, in my view.
Annual training can be useful.
We know how bivalve molluscs retain their vitality.
Which brings me to a final, political consideration.
This seems utterly unrealistic.
Jobs and traditional methods are at stake.
Very much the opposite in fact.
All of us have some examples of this kind.
It is therefore important.
I certainly hope it will work out that way.
I found dozens of basic food hygiene failings.
So why is the Commission creating even more laws?
These technocrats are totally out of touch with reality.
We do not need more complexity.
This problem is first and foremost a political problem.
I think he has written an excellent report.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Slow progress, some might say.
I must first mention the recurring question of comitology.
Amendment No 108 is therefore not acceptable.
I welcome the general acceptance of this.
Amendment No 53 must therefore be rejected.
I therefore cannot agree to Amendment No 12.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
.
The problem is greatest for children and young people.
The control regulation is perhaps more controversial.
That is the kind of attitude that exists.
There is nothing strange about such panic.
I think that the proposal is extremely cautious.
What is happening with the remaining 20%?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Overall, the Commission's proposals are balanced.
Otherwise, I applaud her remarks also.
This dossier has progressed quickly.
I will start with comitology.
I cannot therefore accept Amendment No 22.
I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 18.
I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 7.
I therefore reject Amendment Nos 1 and 16.
I therefore reject Amendments Nos 2 and 22.
I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 33.
I therefore reject that part of Amendment No 26.
I therefore reject that part of Amendment No 25.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Far greater progress can be made with these.
This was by no means an absurd request.
That is the statement the Commission wishes to make.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
In other words, they have doubled.
This is indeed a considerable achievement.
I think that we underestimate our potential.
Mr Patten rightly referred to Kyoto and climate policy.
The truly dramatic situation of Argentina has been mentioned.
Thank you, President-in-Office.
The next item is the joint debate on:
and
But logic is not necessarily sufficient.
It is becoming more political, more international.
We in Europe do not have that feeling.
What then are the concerns?
My report is very clear on this.
Secondly, economic concerns.
What then should we do?
We need a reinforced political dialogue.
What does this mean?
The consequences are considerable.
The question is: what can we do?
How can we do that?
I think we need a radical paradigm shift.
We need to move away from mutual observation.
And we shall welcome it on Parliament's part.
This exemplifies what I stated earlier.
Terrorism is the main case in point.
The war on terrorism comes first.
Lastly, there is the question of non-proliferation.
The estimated cost is USD 10 billion.
President Bush admitted these accusations were unfair.
Each party presented a clear statement of its position.
The latter increases aid to American growers.
The Summit's effects will be far-reaching.
But they also strongly underlined their enduring strength.
We have worked together to seize terrorist assets.
No one has to apologise for that.
Not to keep quiet, in my opinion.
Europe and the US are the largest trading partners.
Let me make one final point.
Let me say something else.
I deplore, as he does, anti-Americanism.
(Applause)
I was mistaken, as were others.
Europe can also have a genuine common defence policy.
Yet, this support need not be uncritical.
On steel tariffs also, US policy is misguided.
Also because the United States is no monolith.
What does this mean in concrete terms?
In my view, this specifically means three things.
I can support the resolution on these scores.
These questions remain unanswered.
This would be very detrimental to transatlantic relations.
Despite this, our ambitions go further than this.
The report deplores American unilateralism.
The lack of a Community approach affects many areas.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off.)
The steel issue will be resolved eventually.
There is a challenge here for us.
Parliament has a modest role to play.
I am pleased that the Commissioner recognised that.
Furthermore, this debate has not proved controversial.
Therein lies our weakness, however.
One really does exist.
I hope the Commissioner can produce that for us.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the vote.
Amendment No 1:
This aims to create the European Research Area.
Thank you all!
(Loud applause)
We will now continue with the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
34 p.m.)
This agreement is a milestone in our relations.
We thank you for your visit.
I give you the floor, Mr President.
(Loud applause)
Many different roads meet in this beautiful European city.
Of course, integrity and accountability alone cannot suffice.
Early results are already evident.
Mexico now has a stable economy.
I should like to mention one example.
They are now but genuinely so.
This was previously unheard of.
The aim is to stimulate economic and social development.
Decentralisation is one of these.
The indigenous communities represent a further major challenge.
They account for 10 million Mexican citizens.
It is a two-pronged policy.
(Applause)
Development is urgently required.
We must move our relationship forward.
Thank you for your attention.
(Loud applause)
(Standing ovation)
We disagree.
This is not his problem.
That is unacceptable.
Report Caudron (A5-0153/2002)
But what are we searching for?
That too is research.
Protection of this God-given life cannot be surrendered.
I should like to make three ethical observations.
We must also encourage a Europe of discovery.
.
strengthening the scientific and technological basis of European industry;
encouraging it to become more competitive at international level;
the need for specifically transnational research.
I have voted against the report.
Community resources must benefit all countries.
Why is that?
Because they have gone to lunch.
The secretariat started looking forward to their lunch.
Why should we always eat them?
.
.
.
How can it resolve these problems?
We do not share this view.
These two approaches will soon clash head-on.
Which is the more important for democracy?
It is clearly the logic of the nations.
But which is the more powerful?
In other words, more of the same!
.
I cannot vote in favour of such a report.
That is why I have abstained.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
It certainly represents a compelling deadline.
I know we all condemn this wholeheartedly.
There is no possible justification for such acts.
We know that reform is difficult.
But reform there must be.
|
We want to see the financial control mechanism strengthened.
In this work we face a serious dilemma.
The answer is that we cannot give that guarantee.
Meanwhile, our resources are stretched to the limit.
These are extremely serious allegations.
We are obviously examining them very thoroughly.
However, there are some hopeful signs.
May I congratulate you on your successes in Reykjavik.
Yet the accusation is extremely unfair.
Violence is no solution.
The terrible suicide attacks must cease.
Killing innocent people can never be justified.
Nor are the Israeli attacks justifiable.
We have discussed this on several occasions.
A few words about the conference.
This is not the first conference.
What should actually be on the agenda, then?
What should our point of departure be?
There is no agreement here.
This is also an established fact of transatlantic relations.
For some Members, it was their first visit.
I feel that their work does Israel great credit.
We must not be racist.
In all this, we agree with Commissioner Patten.
The European Parliament shouldered its responsibilities by adopting resolutions.
There must be another Palestinian Authority.
Let us therefore get to work.
That is what we are trying to do.
We have had long peace processes but no peace.
They will all be necessary.
It is not going to do so.
The debate is closed.
There are many formulae for solutions.
However, a number of documents are already accessible.
(Applause)
It would be best to be blunt here.
The first is the rotating Presidency.
So how should we proceed?
We neither agree on everything nor differ on everything.
These are issues on which we partly agree.
It means that everyone is equal.
It possesses a legitimate power of decision.
Much of that will require treaty amendments.
That is a matter for the Convention.
That is of fundamental importance.
That is also well and good.
Others will not.
Other changes can be made without amending the Treaties.
They should do this properly.
Spain has a big responsibility in terms of openness.
I wish them good luck!
The debate is closed.
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
Subject: More beneficial use of unspent budget appropriations
The Council and Parliament together comprise the budgetary authority.
I am delighted with your response.
Things can change, as you can see.
All of this must be done.
I could not agree with you more.
Subject: North East Asian Development Bank
The Basque Country is not between France and Spain.
It is not Andorra.
The Spanish translation was not taken into account.
The Northern Irish issue springs to mind.
I was not entering into any debate.
Subject: Influx of immigrants from the Third World
I asked for plans and dates.
When shall we have this sort of policy?
Surely this is a contradiction, Mr President-in-Office?
Which countries are they?
Why do you refuse to name them?
All these matters were discussed for hours.
Britain is doing so, and so is Denmark.
Subject: Discrimination against Moroccan workers replaced by eastern Europeans
You must ask specific questions.
Recently he went blind in his left eye.
Subject: EU Recruitment Office
That is not really a question.
It is the speaker's opinion.
Mr President, perhaps something was lost in translation.
Subject: Proposed new Danish immigration laws
Subject: Family unification and EU citizenship
The Court of Justice will then resolve the matter.
Subject: Creation of a Euro-Mediterranean development bank
Subject: The nature and funding of Galileo
It has been decided to launch the Galileo project.
No, definitely not.
Subject: Child slaves on cacao plantations in West Africa
, Council.
I would thank Mr de Miguel for his reply.
Subject: The Lisbon strategy and full employment
Subject: EU police academy and EU border police force
In 2001, the network was set up.
CEPOL's activities will increase throughout 2002.
However, I have two specific supplementary questions.
My second question concerns the border police.
Are these perhaps the lines of thinking?
What would be the language of command?
Firstly, borders are not guarded by soldiers.
Subject: Availability of Council meeting and committee documents
Thank you, Mr President.
We set great store by the employment strategy.
Funded with European money, no less!
I think the President-in-Office neatly side-stepped my question.
What were the arguments?
What was the balance of opinion on that occasion?
Surely he can share that with us this evening.
It increases local skills and knowledge.
It brings about local ownership development projects.
This is all I can say in this regard.
Subject: United Biscuits' closure of the Fontaneda factory
Therefore, current legislation must be applied.
It is the culmination of fifteen months of work.
Second, the Union has its own competences.
Third, and finally, there are shared competences.
This will be by far the longest list.
We have put forward two basic suggestions about this.
Oh, no!
Bayer have equalised.
No-one is perfect.
Look at him, he even seems cheerful.
The rapporteur states this very clearly.
This report refutes those arguments.
They are quite limited but important.
Not at all.
All this is well presented in the report.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is a very important point.
We in our group believe much in extended subsidiarity.
For that the rapporteur deserves our gratitude.
Why?
We even want to achieve full employment by 2010.
Mr President, I gave the wrong information.
(Applause)
The principle of subsidiarity must therefore be strengthened.
However, I do have some objections.
What are those objectives?
We must go further.
At world level Europe is committed to effective multilateralism.
It chooses full employment and progress in human capacities.
These choices are what gives Europe its identity.
Let us try to spell it out.
My position is similar to theirs.
Two brief comments.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I believe that we are in a constituent phase.
At least, I hope so.
We could have done more.
That strikes me as being of absolute importance.
However, much more will remain the same.
The age of eloquent diplomacy is over for good.
I believe there are some problems.
The missing competence thus ceased to be a problem.
We might be expected to do a bit more.
This clarification is inseparable from any ambitious institutional reform.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
We need to think how different Iraq could be.
What is different?
We want this to be set up without delay.
Those refugees are being given insufficient support.
So we are recommending a rehabilitation agenda.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Let us remain mindful of this.
We should remain mindful of all of this.
War is not a solution.
The Arab countries dread an insurrection of their masses.
The report is, of course, inconsistent.
There are contradictions in it.
It draws up demands that are necessary.
There must be no war.
The Nicholson report is outspoken about this destabilisation strategy.
There is no doubt about that.
These are plain facts that we must not forget.
That is our greatest concern.
The Kurds have no sympathy for Saddam Hussein.
They want a new regime.
Saddam Hussein is still firmly in power.
It is clear where the fault lies.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
They were rigged.
That I do not believe!
We go there more than we do anywhere else.
We know that.
Hoxha was Hoxha and he was appalling.
I was the rapporteur on the Agreement with Macedonia.
That is why I share Mrs Pack's view.
Their first test will therefore be these presidential elections.
But these steps need to be consolidated.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
Why do we need this initiative?
We accepted this ruling.
What are we working towards?
They do so for the sake of cultural diversity.
Let me give just one example of this.
I am one of the latter.
I would like to explain why.
I should like to give an example.
For that I especially thank Lord Inglewood.
Many thanks for listening.
Thirty seconds early: Happy Birthday!
And so say all of us.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
Sustainable development
So I shall refrain from doing so.
So what should we be doing?
What should we be talking about in Johannesburg?
This is where the problems lie.
They are also distancing themselves from those who have.
The second is about harnessing globalisation.
What does this mean?
Johannesburg has to deliver results.
There are nonetheless certain bright spots following Rio.
We need committed political leadership on the issue.
Political priorities need to be set.
These units would be built in rural areas.
That is unsustainable.
We have had enough words.
What we need now is action.
This excellent report confirms that.
I would like to highlight one aspect in particular.
I think Johannesburg must start here.
There are two main reasons.
GDP growth has nothing to do with sustainability.
Poverty breeds population growth.
We had high expectations in those days.
Unfortunately, there is little reason to be cheerful.
It is high time we did something about this.
This form of cooperation should be strongly encouraged.
I was honoured to be one of its members.
Only then will positive developments start to become visible.
However, there are good examples too.
I should like to make two points.
I look forward to your answer.
Allow me to specify some individual and crucial features.
Rio was a milestone.
Without a strong economy, environmental protection is impossible.
We have not even begun negotiating yet.
Global economy requires global rules.
This is not certain.
Particular attention will be paid to maternal health.
Here we need more than monitoring.
We need policing.
This has to be discussed.
I could not agree more.
This is needed.
I thank Parliament for the contributions today.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12.00 p.m.
There is a spiralling problem here.
To get back to the basic challenges.
The target will not be reached until 2030.
That is where our attention should be focused.
It contained general statements.
What should the Commission do?
I should like to make two other points.
I do not think so.
It is a fundamental human right.
I wholeheartedly support a more dynamic approach.
A greater effort is what is required here.
Agriculture is not directly comparable with other economic sectors.
These are the low points.
It is a politically created, negative situation.
We have to be clear what we are facing.
I agree.
Once again, I could not agree more.
These are strong words.
For Europe complacency is also a real risk.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
I have received six motions for resolutions
(Loud applause)
English is the original text.
Amendment No 2:
The intention is to strengthen this amendment.
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
Amendment No 57:
Amendment No 6:
That means something different.
I would ask for this correction to be made.
I am sorry.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
We definitely want to retain our Amendment No 12.
I would vote against Amendment No 12.
Is that acceptable?
After the vote on the recitals:
It would contravene the Rules.
The oral amendment to Amendment No 12:
There did not seem to be any objections though.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
.
.
.
The report calls for employment to be more flexible.
.
.
British Conservatives are abstaining on this resolution.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo.
.
The report is clearly supranational in character.
Two main reasons stand out:
This is no longer a policy ...
Let us hope so!
Nothing else will do.
However, you are quite correct.
Here we have a different situation.
What is our responsibility as a result?
We could revolutionise the world.
We should not forget that.
Europe was one quarter of the entire world.
There is the risk that we could become irrelevant.
I see that is not the case.
Is anyone else able or willing to rise?
No.
Then I invite Commissioner Nielson to take the floor.
I agree completely.
I will come back to this.
We are very pleased with that.
We have never had anything like this before.
However, reality can be different.
This has not always been the case.
We are discussing further steps with the UN Secretariat.
This is the real bottleneck.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
There are empty seats everywhere.
We see that it is taking time.
I think that would be helpful for us.
This meant we had fourteen minutes less this afternoon.
We cannot always get it right.
That is a real problem.
This is legally and technically incredibly difficult.
The Commission is monitoring developments in Madagascar closely.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.00 p.m.
We know that 5,000 Moluccans have died.
There was no trial, no sentence.
He was quietly released when the world stopped looking.
Who gave those orders?
We must support the efforts of these authorities.
Instead, this should be placed in the spotlight.
Find out who is funding these terrorist warlords.
This also applies to the Republic of Indonesia.
Physical force is used as a big stick.
The Committee refers to it as a criminal case.
The Papua leaders and the population think differently.
The fanaticism merely disguises itself as religion.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
That was certainly not the case before globalisation.
The findings were deeply worrying.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
It is now due to leave on Sunday.
These are the things we should definitely be demanding.
The Commonwealth has condemned the country.
So has the ACS-EU meeting.
What else could we do, in fact?
Despite everything, the pillaging and killing simply continue.
Mugabe appears to be unassailable.
There may also be another way.
How was it acquired?
When?
Where did the money come from?
EUR 18 million is available to cover immediate needs.
This is the way we normally do things.
How were they able to do that?
That is how it has to be done.
That may not be the case.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Resumption of the session
You are very welcome.
(Loud applause)
That is all I have to say.
Commissioner Fischler is most welcome.
(Applause)
Mr President, two points.
Secondly, on the question of government intervention.
... that is what I am saying!
Agreed?
Agreed!
(Laughter, applause)
We must have a proper investigation.
It is our children's and grandchildren's interests.
Which is why I shall say no more.
We call for a vote on our motion.
(The order of business was thus established)
What has Parliament done since the last such incident?
Mrs KlaÃ, your point is well made.
The whole incident was filmed.
Thank you for drawing our attention to this question.
We will check that between now and Strasbourg.
More and more stocks are threatened by collapse.
Fishing capacity is going up, not down.
Controls and sanctions are uneven and therefore unfair.
The future fisheries policy needs clear objectives.
Current regulations already provide the facility for reprogramming.
That is the main difference.
EUR 800 million have been marked for vessel renewal.
But common inspections also require harmonised sanctions.
You can certainly count on my total commitment.
To my mind, this is regrettable.
(Applause)
We will closely scrutinise these figures in the committee.
This is traditional practice in a democracy.
(Applause)
Multi-species and multi-annual management is welcome.
Technical conservation measures and their development are welcome.
The real problem is a social one.
This is being somewhat economical with the facts.
They are in fact opposite things.
They cannot exist side by side.
Politics and fishing just do not mix.
With fish, we merely hunt them down.
Big mistake.
That is not conservationism.
This is not acceptable.
You have admitted that the studies are incomplete.
You have not done this.
The Commission is acting outside the sector.
His proposal goes beyond fishing.
Mr President, the reform plans receive my approval.
I have a few critical comments to make.
That is just asking for trouble.
What is required here is a balance.
This is European policy..
This plan is dangerous because it is unworkable.
Now to you, Mr Fischler.
Are we really at war, Mrs Figueiredo?
Does this group integrate or render asunder?
Why are the other fisheries nations not involved?
Are they not wanted?
Where does this leave the Community?
Alarm bells are going off in all directions.
We have to make hard choices.
I look forward to the next six months.
The sooner we get a conclusion, the better.
For that, more time is needed.
This would allow the dwindling fish stocks to recover.
Some stocks have experienced a dramatic decline.
The multi-annual guidance programme has failed.
I subscribe to this approach and this clear stance.
I have another critical comment in this regard.
This does not add up.
That is what everyone is saying.
That is why we have reservations and are protesting.
More hotels, more golf courses, Commissioner?
Is this what you call sustainable development?
Commissioner, I really do not envy you.
This is a very pertinent question.
I do not like the route we took.
We all know that.
We must develop a policy that will work.
We cannot deal with every point here today.
These figures come from your services.
That is the important thing.
I hope the House will support me on that.
But before I do, I have a request.
And we need to work together on that.
I fail to see that.
Mr Stevenson quoted a number of figures.
They are expressly provided for in the proposals.
For example, their fisheries effort will be reduced.
We carried out 22 studies on these regions.
They have been for the last year.
Let us not get carried away here!
One tenth!
Some will be raised during the planned mid-term review.
One thing stands, however.
If we ask ourselves, do we need reform?
Can we not keep going with the present resources?
If we ask ourselves, should we reduce capacity?
(Applause)
What does this mean?
(The President cut off the speaker)
The debate is closed.
I am not criticising that.
Manufacturers must be free to reorganise their sales networks.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner.
We came to one main basic conclusion in committee.
That alone illustrates how sensitive this issue is.
And we shall do so.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner.
I have my doubts.
Mr President, this draft regulation is very important.
There are limits to consumerism.
This is a reasonable compromise.
Why pursue this extreme notion of multi-branding?
We must therefore have a vigilant and cautious approach.
We support the liberalisation proposed by the Commission.
I do not believe that this is true.
Not now, not ever.
He has worked through that consistently.
I have managed distribution all over the world.
It is crucial.
They only buy cars relatively infrequently.
It should not be.
This is a widening of choice.
Stick to it!
For that too I am most grateful to you.
This will certainly not happen automatically.
Car manufacturers will not change their behaviour.
The Commission refused to be influenced by the pressure.
Some of you have described our actions as courageous.
Summits are only worth so much.
It is incredibly important to develop cooperation further.
This is an important alliance to build on.
We agree that the US embargo must be lifted.
We must not let them down.
I would briefly mention some other issues.
Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m has already mentioned Cuba.
We very much regret this.
Unfortunately, this did not come about.
Freedoms are under attack again.
They came out in favour of peace and coexistence.
Perhaps we are behaving like a semi-conductor.
Maybe that also applies to Parliament.
That the money we budget be disbursed.
Perhaps the Commission could make a contribution here too.
All this deserves to be discussed.
Its constant support has proved most useful.
A number of speakers have already made this clear.
They involve very many procedures.
Mr Salafranca mentioned Colombia, and rightly so.
It was excellent work involving many individuals.
This resulted in what we term the Western world.
The centre of gravity shifted westwards.
We share principles and values we had developed here.
A strengthened relationship will be in our mutual interest.
These differ from state to state.
This is no easy task, however.
Firstly, national legislation in this field varies considerably.
The initiative is certainly pertinent and worthwhile.
So I removed all that.
I will start with the initiatives concerning Europol.
I will now comment on the draft recommendation.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
On that much we can agree.
We have conceded something in advance.
Europol's functions are about to be extended again.
It is already engaged in active preparations for enlargement.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Modulation has thus far been voluntary.
It is a perfectly good system.
This aspect therefore warrants a great deal of attention.
I will close with one last point.
Mr Fiori said that voluntary modulation has failed.
This is not the role of the CAP either.
Nor is everyone enthusiastic about it.
I think they can.
An outmoded view.
The European rural policy should consider these problems too.
Mr Fiori is doing this Parliament a disservice.
The European farmers deserve better.
The interim review is, therefore, key.
There were 9 countries with 20 million farmers.
So it is not a socially just policy.
And new ideas are exactly what we need!
But just what does society expect?
Agricultural policy needs to take account of various aspects.
I therefore consider the references to eco-conditionality very interesting.
Just the opposite, in fact.
That brings me to Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos' report.
So what are the budgetary implications of Agenda 2000?
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
On unsolicited commercial e-mails.
But no!
And why?
In order to reach a compromise?
Has the fight against terrorism been mentioned?
No, we do not!
We need a proper and extensive public debate.
Mr President, it is very sad.
Citizens have reason to be worried.
(A5-0284/01).
This is quite a while ago now.
First of all, opt-in, opt-out.
Let me put this on the record.
Spammers do not abide by laws or regulations.
But there is no war.
And this is exactly what we are doing today.
We have tried.
I also support several other compromises.
This is our major common need and our aim.
Another category could be household appliances.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
I also recommend that this should be approved.
There is nothing wrong with the amendment in itself.
All these are very important.
Another important point is the charge for supplying information.
That is why we have tabled Amendment No 48.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Why do we need this particular proposal?
We have noted serious lapses in the process.
There are 834 substances still to be evaluated.
Interested in what, and why, I wonder?
Secondly, we must exercise restraint when granting exemptions.
Herein lies an important monitoring role for Parliament.
Why am I so concerned about this?
Truly harmful substances.
First, to ensure greater transparency.
It clearly needs to be improved.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
We recognise that this is not easy.
We hope that we will succeed in this.
I must also commend the choice of thematic strategies.
I therefore call for a fair and balanced application.
It is an action programme.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
We are to achieve it in two mandatory stages.
That is not acceptable.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
This study has now been transmitted to the Council.
The Commission will therefore continue to monitor the market.
It is now time for clear-cut action!
Commissioner, let us not be too late.
Mr President, it really is very late now!
What are we in Europe doing?
Why?
We urgently need to take action at Community level.
Thank you Commissioner.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Although true, that is only half the truth.
I request that the Minutes be amended accordingly.
My reply to these two questions is negative.
The risk of shortages is quite small.
That is right and proper.
There is a need to catch up here.
My group supports the Commission proposal.
Deadlines are necessary to force action.
As Mr Novelli said, it is an innovation.
Those proposals mean increasing our security of supply.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
A one-size-fits-all approach will not work.
Air transport contributes significantly to air pollution.
However, this report raises two series of problems.
The second problem is that of funding.
Mr President, this is beyond me.
This is also unacceptable, in my view.
The Iron Rhine is one such case.
The good cause is not served by duplication.
The distribution of tasks must be clear.
This proposal by the Commission is realistic and sensible.
That means that we should work together well...
(The President cut the speaker off.)
The network resembles the parts of a rag rug.
I hope that the House today supports that position.
Indeed, most Member States have been left out.
We cannot therefore accept Amendment No 10.
In short, I cannot make a commitment.
Thank you, Mrs De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 p.m.
Let me highlight four steps in particular.
Legislation and voluntary action are not mutually exclusive.
We must and should encourage both.
The EU must follow suit.
We have tabled and re-tabled some amendments.
That is something I have fought against.
The inclusion of supply-chain responsibility for us is crucial.
We hope that will be taken up.
Everything changes for the better, including child labour.
Social responsibility is what it is about.
The great players did not have a chance.
Intelligent adjustments were made to the rules of football.
We live in a different world.
This we must change.
The crucial thing is transparency.
This is a purely economic concept.
What does this mean?
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 p.m.
In the long run, this cannot be tolerated.
This indicates incredibly poor management.
My group supports this position.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 p.m.
The Commission and Parliament have now been warned.
Thank you, Mrs Frassoni.
Parliament is now fully informed.
You are completely within your rights, Mr Cappato.
Your request will therefore be taken into account.
A question remains unanswered.
This is the problem.
The remaining amendments cannot be accepted by the Commission.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Mrs Korhola also wishes to speak.
The plenary has taken note of that.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Absolutely!
Previous judgments give us very clear precedents.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
I therefore recommend that the House adopt it.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
This is due to an oversight.
I ask you to take note of this.
Very well.
The language services have now been notified.
That has been noted, Mrs Peijs.
I have voted against this paragraph.
Therefore I have voted against.
Why did I vote for it?
.
This is left to the Member States.
.
.
Here's to environmental information!
How could I vote against the directive?
This is why I voted for it gladly.
.
in writing.
This is not only odious - it is dangerous.
.
What type of thieves, Madam President?
I voted for the motion, Madam President.
How can I explain why?
I dreamt that I had become a VIP.
.
.
Therefore the manoeuvre is also politically deplorable.
.
Consequently, it will expire on 23 July 2002.
This Commission proposal would have to apply until 2010.
That is why we are not supporting this report.
I urge Mr Monti to speed ahead with reform.
.
.
1.
Latin America is an interesting trading partner for Europe.
2.
Support should be channelled through strengthened producer organisations.
That is why we abstained.
.
The money will simply not be there any more.
What do we find?
Prices of the main agricultural products have fallen.
We have become net importers of cereals.
These are not welcome.
I do not think indefinite subsidy is a solution.
Thank you, Mrs Doyle.
The regulations should be more flexible and less bureaucratic.
.
This clearly has not happened.
It makes your mouth water even more!
Yet the situation continues to worsen.
.
We must strive for conditions which are wealth creators.
Corporate social responsibility is good for companies.
The Commission's approach is correct.
Mr Howitt's interventionist approach is wholly misguided.
.
.
Thank you, Mr Purvis.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Resumption of the session
24 000 documents are already available on that site.
We now move to the order of business.
This is what we are about to vote on.
I am told we will not have hot water.
I thought very carefully about coming this week.
I decided that of course I should come.
We are all familiar with this subject.
Please do not interrupt.
I listened to you without interrupting.
I expect the same courtesy from you.
(Applause)
Let me quote from the letter from the Mayor:
There are two points here.
I take your point on the different systems working.
Nevertheless, this is such a serious issue.
On Monday I have no proposals for change.
Is there a speaker in favour of that request?
When did the Commission find out about this?
What have been its findings?
Could we take it as an addition?
Would that meet with the agreement of the House?
(The House accepted this proposal)
Tuesday shall be so amended.
There is no proposal for change to Wednesday.
The ELDR Group has asked for a roll-call vote.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
(Parliament agreed to the proposal)
The order of business is thus established
Thank you, Mr President.
This applies also to staff, assistants, etc.
That is an important distinction.
The following are my requests of you:
Perhaps I will have a chance tomorrow morning.
It is important to distinguish between two separate things.
It is important to draw that distinction.
When will we discuss this in detail in Parliament?
I know that you knew that already.
Ms Thorning-Schmidt created the precedent not very long ago.
Over 80 of them are not controversial.
The burden of proof would be that way round.
That would enliven our proceedings.
That is a reasonable and workable compromise.
If it does work we can continue.
Why not try out something new?
See if it works.
Give us the chance to enliven our debates.
Those will be put to the House.
It is appropriate that the groups look at this.
I know some have suddenly asked for more time.
It did not happen.
What is proposed gives us a much better option.
Please support the Corbett report.
Many congratulations on your achievement.
Our opinion was thus dropped at the time.
This then resulted in a complaint.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is absolutely imperative.
The first is legislative initiatives.
These are the obstacles you have to demolish.
Parliament must become the Centre Court of European debate.
A real parliament, in other words.
This is often a disgrace in my view.
I am interested to hear the reactions to this.
With this, Parliament has searched its own conscience.
This is also required as a matter of urgency.
We will see what happens tomorrow.
Why is this so?
This proposal has two snags.
We are not fair to our minorities at present.
And everything is in keeping with this.
Why fix something that is not broken?
I would thank Mr Corbett for an outstanding report.
I fail to see the connection.
I rather think that the opposite is likely.
Then there is the language issue.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
And the result?
This evening's debate confirms this.
This solution seems to be reasonable.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr Hans-Peter Martin has the floor for two minutes.
Is it even 'What You Will'?
Surely not.
They do not.
Well done!
Why not?
What are we ourselves afraid of?
Of people actually watching us?
It cannot be that.
Is that what you want?
(Applause)
I will focus on the criticisms.
Some were expected and some were surprising.
How do we define less controversial?
But let the onus be that way around.
The same applies to other urgent matters.
Let me just clarify one or two other points.
Even then it is not obligatory.
That is a very reasonable compromise.
There is no harm in trying it out.
Finally, the question of gender language.
I would like to repeat my congratulations.
Thank you very much, Mrs De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The House possesses immunity under two different provisions.
I would like to make two final comments.
But the rapporteur is not without good reason.
Thank you very much.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
However, it is not enough.
This applies all the more to women.
Mr President, social exclusion is a complex topic.
However, we are now facing a certain inconsistency.
No, that is not the case.
That would be all too easy for the governments.
We can conclude agreements and make comparisons.
This is all possible.
This is sometimes overlooked by many.
This is impossible.
We must not overlook that either.
The Commission has specific responsibilities here.
This needs to be stressed with great vigour.
Of course there is the question of subsidiarity.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I want to say something about the individual points.
The alternative would no doubt have been counterproductive.
Member States can also impose fines.
This proposal is both complex and contentious.
I will highlight some of the particular difficulties later.
I hope the House will support them.
That brings me to my final point.
This is not the case.
The choice for consumers has drastically improved.
Unfortunately this is not it.
Our group has tabled two amendments.
This proposal is one of many.
The policy must be adapted accordingly.
We will support it accordingly.
That is the objective.
We have done our homework.
No one can have the sky to himself.
We can promote competition through proper control of slots.
I speak as someone who has started two airlines.
Far from it.
It must therefore also be rejected.
We therefore reject both.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
, rapporteur.
Obviously, I am referring to Luxembourg...
An international solution would be much more positive.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Mr Mastorakis.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Vote on request for urgent procedure
This is unsatisfactory.
I would inform you,
But that which is not, may yet be!
(Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure)
The next item is the joint debate on:
That is the fundamental idea behind the report.
The question of Tunisia still remains.
It is absolutely intolerable!
The gulf is widening.
We are therefore presenting an amendment in this regard.
The rapporteurs quite rightly touched upon this.
That, I think, is a major shortcoming.
This conflict was not on the Union's agenda.
That point was made again at Valencia.
Unfortunately he is on mission today.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
That is the way we want it.
What do we want to achieve here today?
What do we want in addition to that?
I hope that I will also have yours.
The last revision was the sixth, in 1993.
We cannot afford further delays.
Mr President, I support the rapporteur's position.
This is unacceptable.
There is a legal precedent.
The consumer has a right to know this.
It would show that there are alternatives.
That is in itself something positive.
I believe that all animals are God's creatures.
I thank you for your attention.
It appears that we still do.
We want to force them to take positive action.
It is dreadful to derive beauty from animal suffering.
The sooner the better.
The validation procedures must be accelerated.
At the earliest opportunity.
What they are is never spoken aloud.
We are tired of waiting on this issue.
We want to bring that to an end.
We need safe cosmetic products.
How on earth do you think industrialists work?
It is you who have prevented it!
What do you take us for?
Mr NisticÃ² and Mr Nobilia raised this earlier on.
This is stupid and unnecessary.
They would be of clear benefit to consumers.
The Commission would reject the first part.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Another point of controversy concerned the responsible person.
He asked for subsidiarity a moment ago.
Please allow me to comment on a second amendment.
This is also backed by Mr NisticÃ².
Of course we must encourage unremunerated donation.
What is happening in this case is simply dishonest.
I will not tolerate this approach.
That is not the key issue.
The liberal group will therefore vote against these amendments.
Of course their contribution is priceless.
The human body is not a commodity.
The Common Position is a good basis for this.
I should also like to mention an ethical matter.
We must not become emotional about this issue.
We must encourage the public to donate blood.
Self-sufficiency has to be a goal.
I am not alone in saying that.
Indeed, some people could even die.
There is something else.
Amendment No 26 has to be rejected.
Amendment No 10 would cause major problems.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
What products are meant by the reference to crustaceans?
Does that include snails?
That was a task for us here in Parliament.
I am thinking of such things as alcoholic drinks.
Mr Schnellhardt just mentioned alcoholic products.
Our legislation must satisfy the legitimate demands of consumers.
Quantity cannot be allowed to cloud quality and clarity.
Amendment No 13 would abolish only the first possibility.
I cannot, therefore, accept these amendments.
This amendment provides for simplification and can be accepted.
I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 6.
Amendment No 7 comprises two distinct elements.
Neither is Amendment No 12 on the same issue.
These amendments are therefore not acceptable.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the vote.
(The President declared the common position adopted)
You have made a formal proposal.
I will follow the due procedure.
.
This benefits criminals who want to protect themselves.
How many more new products do we need?
This is clearly not now against WTO rules.
We know that that is not the solution.
The solution is regulation by the law.
Our contribution to it has now been made.
.
.
.
Hence my abstention from the final vote.
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.
The Treaty of Nice confirmed this commitment.
Now we need to bring it to life.
.
I see Mr Fatuzzo is present.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Either way it has been a long process.
These are not purely rhetorical demands.
That is what is being done.
Moreover, what is meant by 'essentially'?
Thirdly, the voting age needs to be reduced.
What we are witnessing here is a hold-up.
This is certainly a success for democracy in Europe.
In other countries, the situation was similarly disappointing.
This political architecture is back to front.
These efforts are doomed to fail.
A number of points have also been missed out.
This is unfortunate.
They are therefore not all there without a mandate.
This has not been achieved.
What is to be done under such circumstances?
I personally favour a majoritarian first-past-the-post voting system.
Why?
So congratulations.
You have my full support.
Madam President, I will speak very briefly.
I believe we are dealing with an historic agreement.
I believe this is a very important step forward.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The understanding is that these three challenges are interrelated.
Maximalism and political confrontation get us nowhere.
This remains our assessment after the Bali meeting.
Now is the time for leadership.
The European Parliament is an advocate of sustainable development.
These are, in a way, the lynchpins.
That much is obvious.
We must strike up a dialogue.
That is not something we shall do in Johannesburg.
There are two factors crucial to growth and prosperity.
I believe that is a generally-held view.
We must learn from this failure at once.
We have very little time left before Johannesburg.
What are the real problems?
What was the opposition?
We are talking politics here.
We really do need to find reliable allies.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Four points strike me as being very important.
That applies to agricultural, trade and fisheries policies.
That would send all the wrong signals to Johannesburg.
Mr President, many things have been said.
In conclusion, a word to the Spanish Presidency.
The second priority is the right to water.
Market access is a key issue.
Commissioner, you need alliances in Johannesburg.
Yet it all started so promisingly.
Washington adopted the same attitude in Bali.
These figures are telling and are all too well-known.
Finally, compromise with the US is one thing.
Right now this would be an important signal politically.
Council.
Expectations of the Bali Summit were incredibly high.
What, finally, will happen if Johannesburg fails?
The debate is closed.
This directive now forbids all such discrimination.
It would therefore serve no purpose to repeat it.
Thank you.
Why were the negotiations difficult?
Why is it significant?
Here harassment is considered to be discrimination.
We will organise meetings in Brussels for EU organisations.
The task ahead should not be underestimated.
It provides a more detailed set of ideas.
I missed it.
Is it scheduled for later?
This is a very disturbing discovery.
It is a probable carcinogen, with teratogenic effects.
There were three immediate priorities.
The origin of the contamination is now known.
Products from these companies are currently blocked.
The Danish authorities have also been notified.
The overall situation obviously remains under close watch.
I thank the Commissioner for his statement.
Why is that?
Can the Commissioner give an explanation for this?
We were slightly late, but not that much.
No action has been taken, etc.
Their function is to inspect the inspectors.
The FVO carried out this work.
In this instance we have two different situations.
They are not comparable in scale.
In this instance the legislation did work.
That is my position.
I have three questions to put to you.
I wish to put three questions:
We welcome the proposals in the Green Paper.
The crisis has been going on since September.
The German Agriculture Minister has known since 21 May.
This is now almost three weeks ago.
This is the first test for this regulation.
And what does Article 53 of this regulation state?
You claim that there is only one source.
So you are not convincing me.
However, I have two specific questions.
Why did rapid alert not work?
This is my first question.
My second question concerns the assertion of consumer protection.
I would be interested to find out.
Mr President, that remains the case.
I understand why Members from other countries are displeased.
This has not been achieved.
These plans include banned substances such as nitrofen.
The plans have proven their effectiveness in recent months.
A number of Members raised that point.
The same issue arises with candidate countries.
My services and I support that.
That is probably true.
I can only repeat what I said earlier.
Mrs Patrie then asked me about the Green Paper.
This is a problem.
The subject will not go away.
Sometimes they do fall into traps.
The debate is closed.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I
Subject: Creation of European sugar-refining cartel with Community support
Do this and see what answer you are given.
These are the facts.
Subject: Extension of the 1993 Cable and Satellite Directive
"The Commission is reviewing it."
At the moment this is all I can say.
Clearly, Directive 93/83 is unsatisfactory.
Mr Purvis' reasoning is perfectly understandable and logical.
Subject: Cattle growth hormones
I fully agree with that.
We are then at sea without a compass.
We shall appoint you defender of Members' interests.
However, it has not yet begun.
Subject: Illegal immigration to the EU from Morocco
Part II
I shall respond to them all.
I am not going to interfere, however.
Subject: The Berlaymont Building
What are the current projected costs?
Mr Heaton-Harris has put six distinct questions.
Negotiations are therefore continuing.
I will take questions 2 and 3 together.
I have a couple of supplementary questions.
I hope that it will not be long delayed.
There is no doubt about that.
Thank you very much for your cooperation, Commissioner.
Questions to Mr Liikanen
I am a loyal customer of question time.
I therefore prepare my questions.
I do not understand this.
This is how things stand.
Subject: Measures to boost the European tourism industry
Concentrated Internet marketing would be the cheapest way.
We need to pay particular attention to that.
Our scope is therefore limited.
Subject: Migration to an open API
There are three parts to the question.
We anticipate the list's being published this autumn.
Consumer issues are among those covered by the analysis.
That is something on which we completely agree.
I want to give two answers.
Subject: Regulatory impact assessments of SMEs
Hopefully, progress will soon be achieved.
Encouraging discussions have already started between the three institutions.
That is not for the Commission to decide.
Why are so few prepared to take risks?
That is a commitment for the whole Commission.
The Commission has no final view on that matter.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
We take good note of your comments.
We thank Mr Liikanen.
Questions to Commissioner De Palacio
Subject: Dramatic increase in east-west traffic
That is my supplementary question.
That is very important.
Subject: New unlawful aid granted to Olympic Airways
I thank the Commissioner.
But one thing puzzles me.
Real sanctions are to be imposed for non-compliance.
To do it, they will also need support.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
In that way, we are actually making history.
This seems to me to be an historic event.
I will naturally begin with bio-science.
We naturally also want more support for preventive measures.
This is what it is all about.
In the final analysis, this is what matters.
You should see this programme in that light too.
The third point is the European Higher Education Area.
Radiation protection takes up to EUR 50 million.
Could the President ensure that this is corrected?
Now for the Joint Research Centre's specific objectives.
I will therefore try to keep my comments brief.
I have listed a number of points.
Thank you, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
We certainly have nothing against the Marie Curie fellowships.
We badly need them for all our futures.
I will speak briefly about each of the reports.
This is something which will appeal to the public.
That must be emphasised.
I support our amendment on space science.
I support Mrs Zorba's conclusions.
Every citizen wants action on radioactive waste.
The Royal Society in the UK emphasised that recently.
It has not been solved yet.
That is not what the public is calling for.
Europe must become more innovative.
Research results must be translated into new products.
For clarity is still completely lacking in this field.
The Commission therefore has an important task to fulfil.
For what transpires?
Eight nuclear power plants have now been closed.
Binding rules across the EU are essential.
I will confine myself to the nuclear question.
Codecision with Parliament is excluded.
We really need to change this.
This is more than regrettable.
This is unacceptable.
In fact they are by their very nature essential.
We therefore need to invest the necessary research effort.
Mr President, this is a historic framework programme.
Thanks go to everyone who has been involved.
This carries with it its own risks.
Regulators already practise excellent, impartial cooperation.
For this reason I support Amendment No 17.
Perhaps.
No.
Thank you to those who gave us this vision.
So this would be a positive and constructive approach.
I now turn to the individual reports.
The same obviously goes for Mrs Zorba's amendments.
The original wording is therefore unsatisfactory.
Negotiations are progressing well here and that is significant.
I turn now to Mr PiÃ©trasanta's report.
This is where we need the actions to converge.
But 15 000 expressions of interest is quite something!
Mr Mantovani, you also mentioned SMEs.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
.
.
.
This will also be addressed by the European Council.
The Commission wholeheartedly supports the Council's reform efforts.
We must address these issues without demonising them.
We have to act quickly on various fronts.
I thank the President of the Commission.
This is what we expect from Seville.
(Applause)
Nothing new is being said.
Are there any higher offers?
Remarkably, they have not done so before now.
These are not self-contained issues.
Central is therefore also parliamentary control and co-legislation.
They are sometimes right.
The European Union wants a mobile, flexible workforce.
This is the crucial thing!
The final issue is that of immigration.
Europe is a powder keg waiting to be lit.
This applies not in the least to the Council.
What can be done about this?
Not nearly enough has happened, therefore.
The Council has already eliminated one proposal.
This is not on the Council agenda.
We are in total chaos.
This is not on the Seville agenda.
Co-management is not on the Seville agenda.
Are you going to debate this?
You talk of reviewing the Tampere commitments.
We strongly support a responsible attitude towards our environment.
That is not all, however.
The European citizens are demanding this.
We have to support these.
Casualties continue to rise.
So the sooner de-escalation takes place the better.
The overwhelming message is clear.
Let us now turn our attention to the people.
But what we want are differentiated immigration measures.
My second point is the issue of immigration.
This has now been created.
Who is calling this into question?
We must therefore combat it.
Is that the responsibility of the Council?
It therefore concerns a very important subject.
My warmest thanks on behalf of the Commission.
I want to get on with the vote.
(Loud applause)
(Loud applause)
We are here to vote.
A large number of people wish to speak.
The next item is the continuation of the vote.
(Parliament adopted the calendar)
(2001/2040(REG))
However, these amendments are complementary.
It is purely a technical rearranging of the rules.
Concerning amendment 56 :
Could there perhaps have been a mistake?
I shall read it out to the rapporteur:
Let us do that and then vote on 172.
Concerning amendment 144 :
Thank you for the gracious observations.
Concerning amendment 174 :
Mr President, Mr Wuermeling is right.
Rule 159 refers at one point to legislative reports.
We have already adopted the wording for that.
It appears to make sense to me.
Does the rapporteur agree?
We will ensure they are consistent.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the decision)
(1999/2195(REG))
(Parliament adopted the decision)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Report Dell'Alba (A5-0227/2002)
.
I congratulate you once again.
.
.
Hence, our vote in favour of the report.
.
Therefore I gladly support the proposal before us today.
(Recital C).
However, all that would be very complicated.
I have in mind the 15,000 voters of Gibraltar.
.
This is why I opt for proportional representation.
.
This could distort the balance of the final version.
This is just explanations of vote.
Consequently we have abstained from voting.
Some of those amendments were absolutely ludicrous.
It should now be able to cope with enlargement.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
You are extremely welcome here.
So you are welcome and congratulations!
Council and Commission statements on the progress of negotiations;
on the annual report of the Cohesion Fund 2000,
2002/2007(COS));
Our position will be very clear on this.
We cannot act in any other way.
I would like to join them in that call.
We have the best arguments on our side.
That is what European unification is all about.
We are on schedule.
It is a question of dividing the burden.
There is no point in denying it.
(Laughter, applause)
You just have to read Community law.
It is there in black and white.
Passed by unanimous agreement.
That will be a huge achievement.
(Interjection)
This is also crucial for the chapter on institutions.
There will be no political preselection.
I can confirm what he said.
Never have candidates been so thoroughly tested.
We are making very high demands.
We still have to ratify the Treaty of Nice.
We have known that for a long time.
That will be decided during the second referendum.
But here too we must be honest.
(Applause)
There is no excuse for delays.
This is the homework which we have to do.
We cannot make additional demands.
I can even endorse them politically.
The only issue of relevance is the acquis communautaire.
This is a key issue.
Corruption and organised crime are still major problems.
So now is not the time to stop.
We have to keep moving forward.
We must allow no new conditions to be introduced.
That did not stop us joining this club together.
We are failing singularly to do that.
We must not allow them to derail enlargement.
We failed to reform agriculture in Berlin.
We failed.
We failed to carry out the reforms.
We are not telling lies here.
Our group also supports this position.
Social inequality is present to a far greater extent.
Timetables presuppose action.
The planning stage is over.
The winning parties have always maintained this aspiration.
It is also clear that Europe needs a constitution.
Let me cite Latvia as an example.
The tasks to be resolved must be resolved here.
Cyprus tops the league of candidate countries.
Lithuania, for which I have acted as rapporteur.
Secondly, the major political issue of Kaliningrad.
They must listen to the needs of the future.
A Europe in which we feel at home.
However, Malta is not alone in this respect.
Poland is paying this price with great European determination.
This will enable Turkey's progress to be addressed.
Romania now stands at the crossroads.
We must take new initiatives.
Surely that is within our grasp.
This is a major challenge and obligation for us.
Will the financial perspective be extended or revised?
In my view, this is unacceptable.
New Member States will also entail new external borders.
The number of Member States will virtually double.
It will only rise by about 10%.
This enlargement will entail major burdens for us all.
These border regions need our solidarity.
Some of them are prospering more than others.
This situation substantially distorts competition.
They need assistance urgently.
This is described in my report as well.
These TENs are in Europe's general interest.
There is virtually nothing available at present.
Until then, we must help them.
What can we say?
We feel that this is a very important point.
Of course, there are reasons for this.
We cannot accept it.
This is why money and prompt assistance are needed.
Let us try and make the best of it!
Fortunately, it did not do so.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We want a humane and just policy.
How can we achieve this following enlargement?
This is our question.
Many realise this.
That was difficult enough in itself.
Anyone interested should have a look at it.
.
This should be removed.
There are plenty of arguments.
The enlargement process is now underway.
Because it is they who create the most jobs.
The historic task of enlargement must succeed.
We have no alternative.
Expectations in those countries are universally high.
The European House can and will be extended eastwards.
That has already been pointed out.
We want it to be.
We hope it will be.
Cyprus must speak with one voice.
Political leadership is therefore required more than ever.
Who believed that enlargement would be cost-free?
I believe the European Parliament has accepted its responsibility.
Enlargement is irrevocable and absolutely necessary.
Mafia and corruption still remain a curse.
Their fate is often heavily marked by history.
There are scars and wounds that have not healed.
Development of the border regions is particularly important here.
But the EU budget is not under such pressure.
At the moment, the farmers are worried.
Exceeding the financial perspectives will not solve this.
The project's success must be assured.
The report has many merits.
I will mention two examples.
The public needs to know what to expect.
They have a right to know.
This is not an intellectually specious argument, Commissioner.
Credit should be given to his efforts.
We must not allow that timetable to be eroded.
Tomorrow will be too late".
Let us look at individual countries.
I wish to draw attention to one matter.
The price of land is low in these countries.
For that reason my question relates to family farming.
The common agricultural policy must be reformed.
It is extremely important for this to be denounced.
We are not bureaucrats, we are politicians.
We are in favour of weighing up the situation.
Madam President, three points.
My final point concerns Cyprus.
Who is it supposed to exert this influence on?
He might have been able to tell us more.
This you will have cause to regret.
Farmers already in the EU are facing terrifying difficulties.
That would not be so great.
So it includes the phasing-in, the social component.
We can see there is room for manoeuvre here.
There are precedents.
You only need to follow them.
And we are always ready to help you.
That is almost 30% of our present population.
We shall be greatly enriched culturally.
We have seen that before.
The buses could also be watched.
Perhaps his advisor will take this question.
Would that be all right?
Many Russians are in favour of this idea.
A bold step must be taken in 2004.
At any rate, that remains our objective.
I do not see any contradiction here.
Have the candidate countries now satisfied all the criteria?
Poor use is sometimes made of financial resources.
We should not apply over strict criteria here.
Finally, we will not move forward without compromise.
Do not allow them to stand in the way.
It is 'enlargement, enlargement, enlargement'.
They are important reports with which I identify.
But I fully support the Commission proposal concerning phasing-in.
We very much welcome what the Commission has proposed.
At this point we can guarantee full support.
We will give them very critical but constructive support.
We take a similar position on foreign policy.
As an example I will simply mention Kaliningrad.
Not infrequently the problem is the necessary cofinancing.
That is atrocious!
The main section relates to transport.
Cross-border trade is a necessary step.
Instruments like Community Action really have European added value.
In border regions, people come together.
Where has all this money gone?
These funds are not and should not be infinite.
Enlargement is the EU's absolutely most important priority.
It does not.
This should happen now.
ISPA is a case in point.
I should very briefly like to broach another topic.
I call for reorganisation now.
What does the Commission intend to do about this?
This development should be wholeheartedly encouraged.
We have to be very clear on this.
Is there a timetable for the second round?
That need not always be money, Mrs Schreyer.
There are other forms of aid.
We must not forget these countries.
The first accession process is only the first stage.
I think that is a very wise approach.
The timetable is an ambitious one.
So we too have to talk about their problems.
Let us take Sapard as our first practical example.
The flow of funds here is quite inadequate.
They should be kept for agriculture and rural areas.
I am convinced we shall succeed.
Thank you, President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr President, I will be even more brief.
We will have to do some thinking about that.
Let me emphasise one more thing.
That is false.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I would also like to thank all the speakers.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
You are most welcome, Your Majesty.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Jean Monnet said it very simply 50 years ago.
You have all of these qualities.
In doing that you have touched so much.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
JalÃ latu Lmalik , chukran jazÃ¬lan lakum.
The proposal now under consideration deserves my total support.
This is what I have to say to you.
That is something of which you should take account.
Make of that what you will.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The Spanish constitution recognises it.
In fact, it is doing the opposite.
We saw proof of this here only yesterday.
The original intention was to phase out these measures.
The Commission's proposal is to double them.
I have even seen the plants.
(The President cut the speaker off)
No, no, Mrs Lulling.
Excuse me, but that is not permitted.
A personal attack has been made on me.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
We have, however, tabled seven supplementary amendments.
What are this programme's objectives?
That requires effective monitoring and measures to combat fraud.
Democratic national governments should levy taxes.
Undemocratic supranational organisations should not.
This is the case of my country, Catalonia.
With regard to taxes, situations can obviously differ.
Thus, the Basque Autonomous Communities possess real power.
The amendment we have tabled is along these lines.
We must move resolutely towards achieving legislative harmonisation itself.
I should like to thank Parliament for that support.
On that point I agree with Mrs Villiers.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
I look forward to this speedily becoming European law.
I believe that is a wise approach.
It would also be in danger of distorting competition.
We shall therefore vote against this amendment.
A number of amendments have already been discussed.
It is not opposed to harmonisation.
It was not just a compliment.
This hinders the proper functioning of the internal market.
The Commission supports this text.
The Commission cannot accept it.
The Commission cannot accept that amendment.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
We cannot ignore the ecological warning signs.
The industry rejects them outright.
It is a complex approach.
That is exactly what the Commission has done.
However, what did the Committee on Fisheries do?
We must vote against this amendment.
I agree with the rapporteur on this point.
It is completely unacceptable.
This is not a precautionary approach to fisheries management.
We cannot keep refusing to face up to reality.
This would lead to unfair competition.
Theirs is surely a policy of despair.
I have my doubts.
It is crucial that the Commission does this.
There must be no bowing to political pressures.
Safety is of paramount importance.
Who would seriously call their data into question?
Fish swim.
Now!
She refers to that in her report.
There are some measures there to help fishermen.
Let me now comment on the amendments.
For those reasons the Commission cannot accept that amendment.
This amendment is therefore not necessary.
A limitation of fishing effort is therefore also required.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 11.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 12.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 13.
Only short-term measures of this kind can be justified.
Co-financing is a fundamental principle for structural aid.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 15.
That advice is the advice of ICES.
This is also in reply to Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
.
.
.
It was right to reject this proposal.
.
Hence the way we have voted on certain amendments.
.
.
.
Pedestrian protection: Commitment by the European automobile industry
The case for safety is self-evident.
We had three alternative responses to the Commission.
The first was to accept the voluntary agreement.
The third was to recommend a framework directive.
This process must be initiated now.
These are the demands made by the committee.
It will save lives earlier than any other proposal.
This has to be a concerted effort.
This is not a simple issue.
Moreover, it can be a very quick process.
The legislative process is always much more protracted.
Surely, something else should replace it.
I support the rapporteur's motion.
Thank you, Mr President.
This effort is therefore a welcome one.
It is, after all, a dynamic process.
The behaviour of road users is particularly important.
I do not want to be misunderstood.
Mrs Hedkvist Petersen's report reflects this problem.
This one can help cut down on accidents.
Everyone has his or her own responsibility to take.
This power must not be relinquished.
One is related to industry and one is independent.
The timeframe plays an important role too.
However, the EEVC tests too are updated regularly.
For this reason a loose framework directive is appropriate.
Solutions already exist and more are on the way.
They must be speedily adopted.
Thank you, Mr President.
These are the people around which everything ultimately revolves.
However, this has already taken some time.
We have tabled a few amendments on this score.
Commissioner, this new instrument presumes twofold legitimate expectations.
Cars remain excessively and unnecessarily dangerous.
What if one of the partners fails to act?
We are taking only a first step.
We are talking about human life.
The issue is a lot more serious than that.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
I hope that this House will support this approach.
This is a worthy aspiration.
I should like to make three points.
EU declarations do not create socially secure life.
We need to be as efficient as they are.
We now need to pursue that coherence.
Indeed, so should the Council.
That is a vital challenge to Parliament.
It was not, however.
We shall return to this in the Green Paper.
These are all political measures.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
However, a final end goal is not conceivable.
Internet technology is developing fast.
Governments will thus need to follow developments very closely.
This means not exclusively via the Internet.
The report also pays attention to the candidate countries.
We have received encouraging signals from the field.
That is absolutely important.
Information must be available to all.
Machine language should be translated into human languages.
We have kept extremely busy in this field.
Unless everyone is involved our society will flag.
The number of old people is increasing.
Technical barriers must be removed.
Finances are not a barrier.
We therefore have to aspire to that.
If that does not happen democracy will be distorted.
The most important information is not there.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
It is not acceptable.
It is high time something was done.
We will refer the matter to the Quaestors.
It cannot therefore be accepted.
The Commission strongly opposes this amendment.
I thank you for your rather limited attention.
(Laughter, applause)
I apologise for the noise.
Regarding Amendment No 17:
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
The original version simply reads 'Macedonia'.
There is something wrong with it.
It sparked the crisis in Kosovo.
I ask that this serious mistake be corrected.
Mr Sakellariou, it is very simple.
(Applause)
Surely we can satisfy everybody with this text.
Let us stick to this text.
(Parliament gave its assent)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
All other translations are incorrect.
I hope that other language versions are correct.
We will refer the matter to the linguistic services.
Regarding paragraphs 33 and 34:
The remainder of this paragraph would then lapse.
We will carry out the necessary check.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
This should therefore be corrected.
.
.
.
I think that this is over the top.
.
They are totally unacceptable.
.
.
.
There is a serious misunderstanding on this point.
Just the opposite has happened in fact.
The result is now clear for all to see.
.
What do we have to offer?
This is a sine qua non.
.
The entire accession process reminds me of colonial-type dependencies.
We heartily approve of such a move.
We cannot continue like this.
We have voted against the Brok report on enlargement.
Let us not forget this.
.
.
.
The present text thus constitutes a retrograde step.
That is incorrect.
Moreover, it is impossible to comply with.
.
Many of these difficulties are money-related.
.
.
.
.
This must not be a stumbling block for enlargement.
.
The Petersen report helps to do something about this.
Road accidents are not natural disasters.
We must prevent them.
.
.
These measures will fortunately be implemented very soon.
.
That concludes voting time.
They too must fight these practices.
Why?
Adults at work, children in school.
This despite an inspection scheme introduced by FIFA.
This is why I warmly support this urgent procedure.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Two-thirds of the territory is still being occupied.
But I am left with questions.
Why is MONUC not being given any reinforcement?
The population inland is denied any food or medicine.
Such reconstruction will not take place.
Only Namibia has done something.
Mr President, the Inter-Congolese dialogue has not finished.
1.
2.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Equatorial Guinea
Belarus (case of Andrew Carpenter)
Syria (case of Riad al Turk)
Malaysia
Equatorial Guinea
They are doing so in an unacceptable way.
Quite the reverse, in fact.
Political detainees in Malaysia enjoy none of these things.
Between 1993 and 2000, 39 prisoners were executed.
The executions take place by hanging.
Executions were still taking place in Taiwan until 1998.
This too is to be welcomed.
That is deeply regrettable.
I am opposed to the death penalty.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Captain Zidane definitely had not.
We also know what damage then ensues.
Many supporters travel to that destination.
Financially, it is an extremely profitable investment.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Why?
I now turn to Nepal.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Mr President, I have just two technical corrections.
The other point has to do with paragraph 5.
We ask that both these points be corrected.
recital ?:
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
I have voted against the report.
Resumption of the session
We now move to the order of business.
Thursday:
This applies to both Cuba and Afghanistan.
It is proposed as a replacement, as before.
This resolution was submitted on 20 June 2002.
Smug, indifferent bureaucracy is unacceptable.
.
Thank you for your attention.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
This is therefore not about harmonising driving times.
We only want to guard each other from surprises.
National bank holidays will not be harmonised either.
My group will be rejecting all expansions.
These amendments, therefore, undermine the entire proposal.
We voted in favour of it in the committee.
Mr President, I apologise for my late arrival.
I personally believe that we should.
Hence this conflict.
How wide should this framework be?
We will have to accept these bans.
Such a framework need not be very wide.
After all, it only contains additional bans.
Too many derogations would render the regulation ineffective.
More information on this would be very useful.
This is not the place for these.
That too is indeed part of the regulation.
The European added value in this is not self-evident.
We are all working very hard on this.
So I shall say it for the record.
The whole thing is quite logical.
You cannot get economic growth off the Internet.
There is a general need for European regulation.
That is just nonsense.
This is primarily about weekend journeys.
That is the issue.
Are you prepared to support it?
So that is what we need.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
Thank you very much, Mr Savary.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
and
The first concerns language.
The second comment concerns terminology.
I had presented an amendment in this regard.
This is not its aim.
We must establish standard rules for all biofuels.
Thank you, Madam President.
Why should we not give it a try?
We will support this at any rate.
It need not, however, necessarily be so.
Why do we demand this?
Traffic in particular is a major source of these.
The rapporteur has gone into the background to this.
Exemption from duty is a much more difficult matter.
The same goes for fiscal incentives.
Innovation is inherent in it.
Do we want that as well?
If we do, then OK.
A voluntary scheme is often the most viable solution.
There are always dangers associated with coercion.
That should not be forgotten.
The question is how we can achieve these objectives.
I endorse what Mr Linkohr has just said.
In actual fact, we have come full circle.
Now for the misgivings, which are as follows.
One is that intensive farming will be promoted.
Who is calculating the life cycle of conventional fuels?
What, though does 'biological' mean?
Thank you, Mrs de Palacio.
The joint debate is closed.
This report has already been adopted by Parliament.
There must be no room for human error.
Mr President, of firsts there is no end.
Mr President, there is no democracy without transparency!
I am sure that they had problems getting here.
It has been very interesting listening to the Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
We can only applaud this.
This is naturally a staggering statistic.
He is a true advocate for European film.
Let me address just three of them.
This is an important step in the right direction.
We cannot, however, rest on these laurels.
I have listed only three points.
Yet, this is not sufficient.
I should like to make two points.
The question remains, however.
Is it broadcast on a European cinema television channel?
How will we protect the cultural content?
He enjoys cooperating and always works within the consensus.
I am genuinely sorry that he will be leaving.
This is not enough, however.
Furthermore, we must produce a database.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Six others should be finished by 2005.
Where, then, do the problems lie?
My comments?
These include the candidate countries.
Competition must not be distorted.
We are not convinced that should be the case.
I would like to mention two of them.
Under no circumstances can we exceed the latter ceiling.
I shall now turn to Amendment No 10.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Budgets 2002 and 2003
There are two perspectives at the heart of this.
Naturally, we shall still be highlighting these issues.
In our view, there are too few resources.
We need some way of providing new resources.
The timetable for enlargement must be adhered to.
The same applies to the RELEX reform.
This is an extraordinarily important project.
This surplus is not a one-off.
This will also be the case next year.
That can be taken into account in the autumn.
This line would then be replenished where appropriate.
All this will be put before you shortly.
Let me put it this way.
Every year, we repay billions of euro.
Let me just make a couple of observations.
Something is wrong here.
Those three areas are agriculture, fisheries and CFSP.
The third aspect is the CFSP.
That is a dilemma for us.
But category 5 is the big area.
The situation is particularly poor regarding the Structural Funds.
The present system does not work.
The legislation should be completely revised.
My group absolutely opposes this.
The flexibility instrument is meant to cover unforeseen expenditure.
Our real problems are connected with enlargement.
We lack the proper language skills and workspace.
Appropriations were set aside for enlargement under Agenda 2000.
Surely, this discovery should set off alarm bells.
Surely the budget is simply too generous?
Mrs Buitenweg's conspiracy theory fails to convince me.
The message is chiefly for the Council.
Is it poor procedures?
Is it simply rigidity?
Not that much, then, one might think.
There is no greater challenge than this.
This work will now continue in the 2003 budget.
This places particular demands on next year's budget.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12.30 p.m.
increase modernisation of the economy;
help complete the enlargement negotiations; and
lay the foundations for the future European Union.
fight illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings;
This is not just a declaration of intent.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is not a point of order.
We therefore urge you and request you...
(Interruption)
(Applause)
You spoke about the Convention.
(Applause)
That is the first thing.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We invite you when we have a codecision process.
(Applause)
That cannot be described as more Europe either.
I thank it sincerely.
That is at least a start.
It is not one yet, however.
Now for my last point.
However, this is not sufficient.
Congratulations!
Very good.
I have two observations to make after the event.
Come back down to earth, Mr Aznar!
In short, our leadership is flagging.
More success, more progress, less uncertainty.
(Applause)
No sensible person is in favour of illegal immigration.
It exposes Europe's impotence for all to see.
What a great idea!
Much has been said about them.
The Seville Declaration requires military operations to cease.
Bravo, Mr Aznar, well done!
I would appreciate an explanation from the President.
It was right to do so.
We need better spending, Mr President.
However, this is indeed a small step.
We think this would be a mistake.
It is time to take stock, Mr Aznar.
What happened to that?
The fight against terrorism was one of your priorities.
You prefer decrees to dialogue.
Enlargement was one of your priorities.
Mr Chirac!
Both shamelessly exploit human misery for financial gain.
I think I recall that there already was one.
None of these proposals were adopted.
It is above all a moral imperative.
Progress has been made in European security policy.
This is the title which we warmly recommend.
Joint EU-Russian border control could be a first step.
The EU could act as the facilitator in this.
There is no mention of Parliament.
These statements are completely unacceptable.
I have one last question.
You expressed your condolences on that occasion.
Do not call me to order, Mr President.
Firstly, legality.
Immigration in our countries must be based on legality.
That is our objective, to achieve full employment.
(Applause)
My third consideration relates to enlargement.
The Nice timetable expires at the end of 2002.
(Applause)
(Applause)
I will now briefly answer specific questions.
(Applause)
The next item is the vote.
Simplified procedure:
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Before the vote:
.
We believe that the common position is better.
This is something which the amendments do not allow.
We have missed the opportunity to do this today.
Was I dreaming, Mr President?
.
That is why I voted for the motion.
.
.
Why did I mention Martini?
.
That is why I voted for the motion.
.
So whodunnit?
Maybe Mr Fatuzzo!
Why is that?
.
(PT) This report commits three cardinal sins.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
The ECB fully shares this view.
Our monthly press conferences are key in this respect.
Thank you, Mr Duisenberg.
We support the two-pillar strategy.
Pierre Werner was a man of great vision.
(Applause from the right)
That is the way it should be!
That is certainly attributable to Parliament's efforts.
The European Central Bank bears a great responsibility.
This is a pragmatic institution.
This is a claim that we must verify.
Our single currency has become the dollar's equal.
Virtual stock market gains have transformed into real losses.
Wide-ranging reforms of international finance are therefore essential.
The ECB cannot shirk its responsibility.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, I shall make this brief.
That is all I have to say this afternoon.
They will be supported by the entire Governing Council.
There are risks, both upward and downward.
I trust that I have answered the main questions.
Thank you again.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The proposal is totally impracticable.
The traceability system makes such labelling possible.
One has to exercise excessive caution.
The second priority must be a health guarantee.
Lastly, ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
They become more resistant.
Far fewer herbicides and insecticides are needed.
There is less environmental pollution.
That is guaranteed through comprehensive testing.
We know that.
That goes without saying.
So why label it?
It smacks of selling out.
That would of course be a disastrous solution.
I think we are facing one such tragedy.
Our group does not want to label processing aids.
We would like to see the reverse assumption prevailing.
Only expressly licensed products should be marketed.
Unintentional contamination will always occur.
This is obviously what is happening here this evening.
How will we explain this deviation to the public?
Mr President, I welcome the Commission proposal.
We have to continue to ask questions.
Is this really giving the public what they want?
I do not believe this proposal does that.
We have to think again.
Secondly, the consumer should have freedom of choice.
Why?
Let me explain.
This is bizarre.
Many people are concerned.
We have reason to take these concerns seriously.
We as politicians must take our responsibility.
Labelling and traceability do not automatically guarantee safety.
It is therefore unacceptable.
There must be labelling and transparency.
There must be guidelines regarding ingredients.
Providing full information means that consumers have choice.
Certain Member States also would much prefer this solution.
This is fine by me.
Consumers are entitled to choose GMO-free at affordable prices.
A second point concerns the position of third countries.
However, third countries can always call upon equivalence.
I consider this unacceptable.
It is next to lamentable.
I fully support my colleague Mr Trakatellis's approach.
Please do not send us down that road again.
They are particularly concerned.
Crop trials are presently being conducted in Scotland.
There is no getting away from this issue.
Currently, fears about GM foods run high.
How do we reassure people over this issue?
Labels and traceability are one answer.
Traceability puts the burden of proof on the producer.
This has to rest on quality information.
The jury is out.
A GM-free label has been talked about.
These products should not become a costly niche market.
Mrs Scheele's comment on the subject is welcome.
This debate will continue.
Allow me to mention three main points.
Commissioner, I very much welcome your comments.
They are very wise, as so often.
I would like to ask the Commissioner three questions:
Is the Dublin Institute involved in this multi-stakeholder forum?
It has been a voluntary activity.
Mr President, I wish to answer two questions.
Enterprises, though, consist of employers and employees.
How big is it?
How often will it meet?
Where will it meet?
How much will it cost?
Who is going to pay for it?
Can you fill out the detail?
Mr President, just a follow-up question.
Do you already have a ballpark figure?
The debate is closed.
The sitting will be suspended for two minutes.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I
Subject: Measures to ensure legal certainty
Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
Citizens must be aware of their rights.
Subject: Concentrations in the foodstuffs sector
Everything depends on first making a correct analysis.
Basle II concerns the capital base of banks.
Subject: The euro and bank charges
That is no longer possible.
I thank the Commissioner for his response.
That is the second way of obtaining redress.
In French this is a mÃ©diateur bancaire.
I hope this answer satisfies Mr Crowley.
I do not know his telephone number.
Mrs Korhola made a point of insisting on that.
Part I
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
Subject: Steel tariffs and jobs in Europe
Many ordinary citizens wonder about the future consequences.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
The difference is therefore considerable.
Subject: The TRIPS Agreement and access to medicines
That is our position.
The pharmaceutical industry is probably behind this.
We would like to have certainty in this area.
We favour Article 31 over Article 30.
The written notification to the Commission is under way.
None of them?
And never has.
Subject: Tritium measured off the Welsh coast
Thank you for your answer Commissioner.
Subject: 'PescaÃ­to Frito'
I respectfully repeat our invitation, Mr Fischler.
But back to the subject in hand.
We take exactly the same view here.
Subject: Introduction of new fishing capacity through Irish fleet
At which point we instituted proceedings.
We have no legal authority to do so.
Perhaps I should do so straight away.
Which is why these proceedings have not been withdrawn.
I have a very simple question for the Commission.
If so, how much money?
We have to abide by national laws here.
I think that is the easiest thing to do.
I am rather late in asking my supplementary question.
That is my question.
Subject: Tobacco cultivation
How many young farmers are engaged in this activity?
There are around 100 000 tobacco farms.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Priority is given to human and animal health.
Now I would just be repeating myself.
However, consumer freedom of choice is paramount.
One per cent?
It might still have something in it.
Why not 0.01%?
And what is the poor consumer supposed to do?
What does the consumer care about that?
The whole thing is a farce!
I have every confidence in you.
As such, the Commission cannot accept these amendments.
There are further amendments regarding the traceability requirements.
This would lead to unnecessary extra burdens on operators.
This is now a practically unavoidable fact.
This summary will accompany the Verbatim Report of Proceedings.
The first is the scope of the proposal.
The Commission therefore firmly rejects amendments to that effect.
Safety is not the issue here.
This is dealt with in the authorisation process.
There is a good reason for this.
The message to our consumers would be unacceptable.
That is what the Commission is doing.
That has been the objective from the beginning.
That is what Parliament has already voted for.
We have to live in the real world.
That is not correct.
They are two different situations.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The first one concerns the budget.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
This proposal is the product of in-depth scientific analysis.
And each time an enormous tragedy has ensued.
Authorities were only aware to a very limited extent.
This applies particularly to ammonium nitrate and pyrotechnic substances.
Secondly, the duty to inform must be improved.
This is all too ridiculous.
That does not mean simply making documents available.
That was obviously not the case in Toulouse.
Article 9 is the backbone of this directive.
Thank you, Madam President.
I will give you some examples.
So we have taken a very positive approach.
The Commission therefore rejects Amendment No 49.
There are other amendments that the Commission cannot accept.
I shall give you a couple of examples.
Thank you for the debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Moreover, there is reason for concern.
I will give you another example.
Quite the reverse, in fact.
However, we must develop a 3-track policy.
The first track is open sexual education and information.
That is the job of the Member States.
The PPE-DE is also firmly against legalising abortion.
That contradicts our understanding of the word democracy.
So exactly what is this report about?
Very bizarre.
She is right to call for effective measures.
Statistics clearly bear this out.
In those countries, health risks have fallen.
What did those two conferences say?
That has nothing to do with rights.
That is called habeas corpus.
No one wants an abortion.
No one would wish an abortion on anyone.
It has nothing to do with contraception.
It concerns an issue which urgently requires clear policy.
Mrs Van Lancker mentioned this a moment ago.
However, women will go where they can.
The numbers increase every year.
Why?
The answer is quite logical.
It just creates confusion and distrust among our citizens.
Unfortunately, the opposite is the case.
This report is the result of a curious process.
They will dictate to us on ethical issues'.
That concerns me greatly.
Quite a lot of other matters have been raised.
I do not consider it an abortifacient.
It is emergency contraception.
Let us stick to the facts.
We have no competence in this Parliament.
I regret that.
European integration must give priority to these values.
Thank you, Mr President.
Allow me to give you a fundamental reason.
The rapporteur makes numerous recommendations regarding prevention.
Let me give you an example.
It is entirely unsatisfactory.
Why is that?
It cannot be authorised in hospitals.
Yet schools operate for 150 days out of 365.
Shall we take other legislation as our basis?
Thank you, Mrs Hermange.
Now Portuguese women travel to Spain.
Is this right?
Is it sensible or fair?
Better prevention and education will lead to fewer abortions.
This is about them but without them.
Acceptance of the report jeopardises the enlargement process.
Mrs Doyle has already stated this.
The paragraphs bear this out.
In addition, the report is inherently flawed.
It is a political move lacking in strategy.
This is clear from the Treaty.
Let me be clear.
This is the responsibility of Member States.
This applies also to sexual and reproductive health.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
So what was important for us?
The Commission agreed to this suggestion.
It is also important to fund European added value.
This has now been successfully introduced.
Joint liability, but within certain limits.
That is out of the question.
We cannot release our Executive from its responsibility.
Why?
My thanks also to the rapporteur.
But it will not be easy.
This causes problems especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Thank you again to all concerned.
This third element is not the least important one.
We have every cause to be happy about this.
Thank you Commissioner.
She is to be doubly congratulated.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I declare the session closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
The rest of the amendment remains as before.
(The Minutes were approved)
I have two questions for you, Mr President.
That is a useful suggestion.
I know that the European Parliament shares this desire.
We have a new budget to pass.
Here today I will concentrate on the main themes.
The main headings of the programme are:
Fourthly: Safe food.
Fifthly: The EU's global responsibility.
I welcome these decisions.
(Applause)
We want to focus on four areas in particular:
Further, the Danish Presidency will focus on food.
We want to work to secure safe food.
(Applause)
This is an extensive and difficult task.
From Copenhagen to Copenhagen.
(Applause)
New tasks will then be pressing.
(Applause)
Firstly, there is the question of funding.
Some Member States consider the proposal too expensive.
The Danish Presidency will stick to this ambitious timetable.
The second central problem is the issue of Cyprus.
A good starting point has been created.
The time for speech-making has passed.
(Applause)
One Europe of freedom, peace and prosperity.
Thank you, Mr President.
The Irish will be voting on this in October.
The Commission has also been moving in this direction.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Then we will debate them.
We need openness; we need transparency.
All our good wishes for the Danish Presidency!
(Applause)
That would be good for everybody.
We have had the political courage to debate it.
That is the challenge facing you.
(Applause)
Mr President, a brief reference to global responsibility.
You are right to raise global security.
Thank you very much and good luck.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Re-uniting Europe is rightly your number one concern.
(Applause)
You can be prosecuted for saying that in Denmark.
Europe is not yet 'one'.
There is every possibility that this can succeed.
The candidate countries have undergone a fundamental restructuring.
This, I feel, is very sensible.
It sounds very good.
The first question concerns openness in the Council.
My second question concerns accession.
Difference should be respected.
Mr President, President-in-Office and Prime Minister.
I am proud both of Denmark and of you.
Enlargement overshadows all else.
Enlargement will give Europe's new citizens rights.
I am convinced that it will succeed.
You are European champions at manipulating referendum results.
My first question is two-fold.
Now he is a Liberal.
What is really going on here?
Incidentally there is a consensus that they will.
Of course this is allowed.
Danes are, after all, a humble people.
I do not know what this clear message is.
Your priority is enlargement.
What do you intend to do about this situation?
Are you absolutely sure of that, Mr President-in-Office?
A good political decision - well done!
Your country, Mr President-in-Office, has opted out.
My question concerns the recent American initiative.
Is it really possible to enlarge Europe without Poland?
I must say that I am concerned about developments.
Liberalism is what the people of Europe long for.
We can never fight negative forces with negative measures.
You are completing the work of Mr Uffe Elleman-Jensen.
These relate to the huge challenges we face.
Why do I say that?
Only the USA now stands out against it.
The Commission has played its part.
It is in the acquis communautaire.
It has been an interesting addition.
.
I do not intend to go into that either.
(Applause)
Then Mr Poettering raised the matter of better legislation.
We will give this the very highest priority.
Mr Poettering mentions the matter of Turkey.
(Applause)
(Applause)
I would like to correct a misunderstanding.
Then several speakers have raised the matter of Cyprus.
It is a decision taken in 1999 in Helsinki.
(Applause and laughter)
(Applause)
Thank you for your multicoloured contribution, President-in-Office.
Farming incomes have already fallen.
Now is the time to deliver upon our promises.
We support you on your three issues.
We will work with you on that.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This gives rise to at least two points.
I should like to make three observations.
One need only follow the political debate in Poland.
I believe you are clutching at straws.
Why be afraid of the Irish referendum?
Let me cite three examples.
Only a vague reference was made to Africa.
But no funds have ever been committed.
We must step up a gear.
What initiatives do you think the Union should take?
But what Europe, President-in-Office?
Such a wide discrepancy is unacceptable.
Secondly, Cyprus.
We can leave it to the United States?.
That is not so.
I would not dream of doing so.
We can deal with that disagreement in Denmark.
I quote in English from the Berlingske Tidende:
(Applause)
Nevertheless, we cannot have immigration at any price.
(Applause)
I live as close to Denmark as is possible.
I can see Denmark from my window.
Therefore, I am incredibly disappointed in Denmark.
That should give pause for thought.
You could call that a positive attitude.
We now come to the vote.
It will be dealt with by the Environment Council.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Laughter and applause)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That concludes the vote.
The licensing procedure will now be for one year.
That is why I voted against the report.
But how could it be otherwise?
.
This is disproportionate, unenforceable and open to fraud.
I am in favour of the 1% rule.
This too would be unenforceable.
.
.
The rules must be clear and straightforward.
But below that it cannot be guaranteed GM free.
This is how democracy works in Brussels.
That is the only blemish in this report.
.
We will now lead many consumers astray.
That is why I voted for it.
.
This problem too still needs solving.
.
Several snags, however, quickly came to light.
Manipulation all the way.
.
She is to be congratulated for standing her ground.
Access to abortion for Irish women is a concern.
I wish this were discussed more in this Parliament.
I am a UN Goodwill Ambassador for Reproductive Health.
There is no legislation for abortion in Ireland.
Rights at whose expense?
Human life cannot be subject to voting.
Surely this is unacceptable!
Mrs Van Lancker's report is a veritable nightmare.
.
We also point out that:
For the Left, the Right does not exist.
I have voted against this report.
Hunger is a problem relating to poverty.
There are different versions of this.
Zimbabwe is one such case.
On this her birthday another 24,000 will die.
You were right, but you were excessively polite.
That is how much they cared.
Where was the passion?
It cost millions.
And what a declaration!
What a message of hope for the hungry.
What a cop-out.
Think nothing, see nothing, do nothing.
We must take the subsidised cow by the horns.
In principle, there is food for everyone.
There is no shortage of objectives and good intentions.
Both, Mr President.
The developed states are hypocritical.
Hungry people have lost their appetite for them.
(GUE/NGL).
That is why we need practical action and projects.
We cannot hold summit after summit without results.
We anxiously await that communication.
These practices kill.
This fight requires a holistic approach.
Worse still, our actions contradict what we say.
What actions were expected of us?
They all have to be fed.
Things could be different.
This is still the reality.
It is true that subsidies are a big problem.
The figures are overwhelming.
We hope to move forward on this.
I agree.
It is coming.
This is not the case.
We are not moving forward empty-handed.
But the next step is Johannesburg.
The price tag is high.
Some things do work.
I have tried to clarify this issue.
It is a man-made and political issue.
That has to be kept in mind.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Parliamentarians have spoken and written about it.
That is a policy we wish to continue.
This is very much welcomed.
But on one thing we stand firm.
Thank you, Commissioner.
We are excited about the establishment of this Court.
It is outrageous.
Perhaps this is an opportunity for Europe.
Strict agreements?
Discipline?
Meanwhile, the questions are mounting.
Is this also how the German Government views this?
Only the imperialist mind thinks in this way.
The United States does not want partners.
It will only accept acolytes.
It is, quite simply, an empire.
And they will perhaps criticise Israel.
There are other problems.
The United States is playing with fire.
This should also apply to Americans worldwide.
However, two things should be prevented by Europe.
This immediately brings me to my last point.
However, this is only one piece of legislation.
What is the problem, then?
Seventy-six states have now ratified the statute.
What does the US have to hide?
What criminals is it trying to protect?
We view the matter very seriously.
Thank you, Commissioner.
In the end there were some sixty amendments.
The current Directive is a minimal directive.
Therefore, the road before us is not easy.
Parliament's report is a compromise report.
You have no chance of redress.
Yes, this is a true story.
This report is timely.
But let me sound a note of caution.
Some problems, nevertheless, persist.
This has not, unfortunately, been common practice.
It has all been too little, too late.
Our quarrel is not with them.
I take the timeshare issue very seriously.
Therefore, more needs to be done.
I attach great importance to your resolution.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
Subject: Draft law on the media in Turkey
Mr President, thank you for your friendly welcome.
That is the way it is sometimes.
Thank you very much.
You gave a very clear, excellent reply.
I have nothing further to add.
For better I hope of course.
I am pleased that we are agreed on this.
Subject: Revocation of Nice decisions on European military force
Mr President-in-Office, what you said was perfectly clear.
Is there any news since Seville?
Is this perhaps something we should be looking at?
Subject: Georgia
It is a genuinely tragic situation.
Conflict resolution must therefore be our first priority.
We look forward to progress in this area.
We believe we are doing what we can.
My question also relates to Georgia.
They are neighbouring countries, Mr Posselt.
We must not underestimate this problem.
Nor are we doing so.
So I agree with Mr Posselt in a way.
President-in-Office, would you clarify the position?
Subject: WTO and imports from world's poorest countries
This is a world first.
It is the only credible and sustainable way forward.
That is a central feature of the internal market.
Has Mr Bolkestein perhaps misread the situation?
To put the question again?
Very good.
We thank Mrs Paulsen for this decision.
Welcome, President-in-Office.
It is a pleasure to see you.
Subject: UN special session on children
The section reads as follows in English:
It will not happen again.
Subject: Democratic opposition leaders on trial in Equatorial Guinea
Subject: Arrest of opposition leaders in Equatorial Guinea
Hence, our demand that the cases be re-examined.
Subject: Cutting back on greenhouse gas emissions
Thank you for your answer to my question.
Subject: Loya Jirga and Afghanistan's future
Nor were they able to undermine its legitimacy.
Hopefully, this situation will now change!
Nor have I heard the European media say that.
Subject: The PKK and the 'anti-terrorist list'
Subject: The European Union, the PKK and Turkey
This action has not been taken by accident.
Consideration has been given to it.
The matter has been carefully investigated.
There is nothing to suggest that it will.
Unfortunately, my questions about KADEK were not answered.
Mr Haarder has not said a word about this.
Surely terrorists are at work here too?
Or let's take the case of Leyla Zana.
Anything I said would be subjective.
Matters must proceed properly.
Matters must proceed on an objective basis.
I shall make a point of reading it.
Hence, these criteria and this list.
Subject: Attempt to criminalise political beliefs in Slovakia
The discussions on the individual definitions have been outstanding.
He has struggled with it as a lawyer.
This type of machinery operates very satisfactorily.
I have seen these installations.
They are engineered to very high standards of safety.
This is still not fully satisfactory.
That should read "0.15 metres per second".
I lay no blame on the Commission.
They are still being discussed in the Council.
We do not want to let them down.
Please get this resolved as quickly as possible.
One of these has already been mentioned.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
It is also a very topical and timely report.
The rapporteur has looked very closely at the possibilities.
It is very timely legislation.
This is not the case today.
They are afraid to go out.
They feel threatened.
This is totally unacceptable.
It is a question of balance.
This is unacceptable.
This is the example to follow.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The European countries also have national anti-racism legislation.
Let me briefly explain why.
The key word is the Internet.
There is far less focus on deeds.
That is something we cannot support.
What does the report do?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We cannot agree with these objections.
We therefore support it wholeheartedly.
This too is in the interest of legal certainty.
Enormous investments are involved.
Companies are entitled to prompt and simplified procedures.
I would like to mention a few particular points.
This is not currently the case.
Secondly, acquisition control must become more predictable.
Thirdly, the Rule of Law could be strengthened.
Mr President, we need stronger companies in Europe.
We need more competition.
At the same time, procedures must be improved.
We want competition on the basis of common rules.
Commissioner, we naturally have wishes as well.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I want to be very clear on this point.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
So far only Namibia has ratified the convention.
They are extremely slow growing.
That should already be cause for grave concern.
Details of this are contained in my report.
The administrative procedures need to be improved.
What does the Commission mean by real interest?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The first is to do with delay.
The second relates to content.
Some reports were incomplete or illegible.
This, Mr President, is a crucial point.
I will now continue in my own words.
I commend them for their worthwhile and committed efforts.
That was how it put it.
These changes are hugely disappointing and hugely worrying.
Let us be clear about this.
The Commission welcomes this.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
Gender equality programme (2001-2005)
We need to go further, however.
This report calls for a solution to be found.
My second question pertains to paragraph 5.
Only 23% of entrepreneurs are women.
I have been asked if I agree with it.
Of course I think we need this Institute.
The rest expressed no opinion whatsoever.
So it works at two levels.
I have one political comment.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The BÃ¼rkert works in Ingelfingen were saved by this.
We shall hold the Commission to that promise.
I think this would serve people the most.
Parliament sees local employment markets as having priority.
Integration is being promoted.
Dialogue is taking place between the social partners.
This is already the case in certain sectors.
This is where the local dimension comes in.
I myself come into contact with this.
We must achieve such a balance in the future.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
So, what does this strategy involve?
Are we going to leave it at that?
The second guideline action concerns development policies.
Let us take just one example.
Some people believe that social issues are still abusive.
Where are they abusive?
When are they abusive?
This is an important point.
It is not work.
Thirdly, core labour standards are universal.
Europe has to be part of making that happen.
It is positive that this is being done.
This anonymity leads to discomfort and unrest.
I am grateful for this.
We must therefore put the pressure on.
My group tabled amendments to this end.
Rich world states should search their own conscience.
We hope that Johannesburg is a turning point.
Economic processes have an impact worldwide.
My first question is about Europe itself.
People are still being abused in our own countries.
Just think of child labour or domestic slavery.
These practices contravene fundamental labour standards.
To what extent are you involved in these issues?
These matters should also be followed up.
The role of the International Labour Organisation.
I would like to stress the following fact.
We will be voting against both amendments.
Regarding Amendment No 14:
The former is correct.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
The correction will, of course, be made.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
.
The European Machinery Directive has two quite divergent objectives.
We would hereby like to clarify our position.
1.
2.
We are mounting resistance.
Undoubtedly, racism is a dangerous and unacceptable phenomenon.
1.
2.
.
But this is not the spirit of Nice.
.
.
.
It was looking back instead of forward.
In short, it was a large-scale pass-the-buck operation.
.
.
.
.
.
However, every well-meaning person must be wondering:
1.
2.
3.
4.
I am sure others have too.
The latest scam is basically establishing so-called holiday clubs.
.
.
.
Large, profitable companies can buy up other companies.
This applies to all aspects of the CFP.
The proposals in their current shape simply cannot survive.
.
.
.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
The problems are immense, as the Commissioner said.
That is the main objective.
Some progress has been observed in this direction.
However, these are only expressed hopes.
The Transitional Government?
Thank you, Mr President.
The role of the neighbouring countries is also crucial.
This is something that I very much doubt.
I hope that they will be proven right.
I do not propose to go over them again.
This is something we must avoid.
I have no faith in these.
We think that other means should be employed.
Thank you, Mr President.
I call for open-ended negotiations.
It is also our duty to understand their history.
That is what they need now.
It was par excellence a least-developed country.
We have over 100 aid agencies working in Somalia.
Women are abused.
They have little, if any, educational opportunities.
Nearly 100% female circumcision is practised.
We must support the transitional government.
That is their choice.
They have elected governments.
It shows that Somalia is a complex region.
There are some areas of despair and desolation.
There are also areas of regeneration and stability.
I have received five motions for resolutions
on Angola.
This aid must be provided effectively and quickly.
.
We must attach priority to the issue of Angola.
We must take action to strengthen factors for trust.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
on Zimbabwe.
We should put pressure on them too.
Thank you, Mr President.
No longer is there either prevention or treatment.
Poverty makes these people's misery even worse.
And this with the winter harvest on the fields ?
Cows simply need to be milked.
Nobody should stand by and allow this to happen.
That must not continue.
It is high time that strong sanctions were imposed.
I have no hesitation in saying that.
Zimbabwe was once the bread basket of Africa.
The humanitarian crisis has taken on huge proportions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Sentencing of Grigory Pasko (Russia)
Persecution of homosexuals (Egypt)
Freedom of the press (Belarus)
What did Grigory Pasko do?
We saw this at the NATO summit in Rome.
We see it in the OSCE.
This has nothing to do with reality.
He protested at the commission of a crime.
The Association Agreement needed renewing.
Europeans and women were spared from the charges.
Even so, these men risk harsh punishment.
A second trial contravenes all legal principles.
What do we ask?
Look at me.
I am human.
I bleed.
I laugh.
I cry.
Thank you, Mr President.
This is a bad advertisement for that country.
This problem has still not been solved.
Old times persist in Belarus.
This is on top of our own experiences.
This is indicative of the climate in that country.
Two recent examples illustrate this recent development.
Despite everything, it is a European state.
A new strategy is required.
We must support democracy but without splitting the country.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
I think it is difficult to recommend doctrinaire solutions.
The situation in Argentina is certainly awkward and sensitive.
We must help others to help themselves.
We utterly reject the joint resolution.
Now there is a need for reforms.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Resumption of the session
The following change has been proposed:
Wednesday:
There are no disagreements about this.
Thank you very much.
(The agenda was adopted)
I really do hope that you will do this.
I am gravely concerned about this.
I will check that.
But everybody stays silent.
It is absolutely repugnant.
That is how repugnant it is.
What he has said puts me in danger.
That concludes this item.
We are sorting and collecting our waste.
There are now recycling installations all over Europe.
This is demanding and labour-intensive work.
Secondly, the environmental yield is not always obvious.
We discussed the Commission's proposal against this background.
One effect is at any rate clear.
My third point concerns recycling.
Excessive national targets no longer distort the market.
My next point concerns re-use.
Re-use also generates most internal market problems.
A final point concerns heavy metals.
Producer responsibility is not only of a financial nature.
How is that to be achieved?
We must be flexible.
It is absolutely necessary to revise the packaging directive.
Material-specific recycling targets should be closer to one another.
Consumers must participate in prevention.
Look at the attitude towards recovery.
Radical changes in these areas are absolutely crucial.
The progress made is clear to see.
Let us see if we can improve them.
We need to think very carefully about this directive.
My colleague has already mentioned this.
97% of our waste is landfilled.
I hope that we all take our responsibilities seriously.
That is fine by me.
It has had an incredible effect.
I understand the United Kingdom is looking at it.
One fairly prosaic example is the toilet paper tube.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I hope that Parliament will approve my proposal unanimously.
Much more needs to be done.
I will just focus on two main issues here.
Since then, things have only got worse.
But the trend is not satisfactory, Commissioner.
TRIPS must be implemented fairly.
The issue of compulsory licensing must be resolved.
What works in one country does not in another.
That is my conclusion in general.
These amendments pertain to the following points.
This is how it has always been.
We will therefore need to make the necessary adjustments.
I have just come from Johannesburg.
Lastly, new funding must be found urgently.
Who is he trying to kid?
We must listen to them.
This is a significant starting point.
That is what sustainable development is about.
The first signal should be that of credibility.
Only then can we really talk about sustainable development.
This hypocrisy must stop.
It is a matter of power relations.
It is therefore first and foremost our problem.
That is not what this European Parliament wants.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
It is understandable why Members are concerned.
Much of it is genetically modified.
This would be disastrous.
It merits closer examination.
Furthermore, our degree of self-sufficiency would scarcely change.
We will be discussing these proposals in the autumn.
This does not make sense.
This situation must be reviewed.
I sincerely thank Mr Stevenson.
This failure is both serious and regrettable.
I agree with the conclusions and the diagnosis.
This would offer welcome assistance in their current plight.
This is also a significant environmental issue.
Quite simply, this is unacceptable.
Mr President of the Commission, we now want ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
I congratulate Mr Stevenson on his magnificent work.
Why can we not provide solutions?
Why is that?
Second comes the issue of GMOs.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(Applause)
Announcement by the President
This cooperation is essential.
Thirdly, penalties.
We should not be dogmatic in this respect.
Another point concerns the service providers.
We have made a step forward.
It is an ambitious proposal.
Other shortcomings can also have major consequences.
Harmonising all of this with national interests.
Let me make that clearer by giving some examples.
That is a great step forward for Europe.
Things still need to be done in that area.
That would be harmful.
We need the creation of functional blocks of airspace.
Safety must be the highest priority.
I shall try to explain what I mean.
The current system is far from perfect.
In addition, it is already cross-border in nature.
There is also a problem regarding method.
This conciliation process must reach an effective agreement.
We cannot continue to accept this situation.
That is one way to do it.
That is against international rules.
This needs looking into.
There is broad consensus on these goals.
But we are not there yet.
The aviation dossier is a case in point.
However, this issue is not about controlling airspace.
A unified system through Eurocontrol already exists.
That is the real agenda.
Finally, let us not forget consumer rights.
One in three flights in Europe is delayed.
Business is disrupted and delayed.
I hope that this proposal will be widely supported.
We have done ours.
Now it is up to the Council.
They regard flying in Europe as safe.
Quite clearly, something is out of proportion here.
More delays are occurring.
There is still much to be done.
An amendment has been tabled to this effect.
We must now wait for the next developments.
The services involved in providing control cannot be disassociated.
And that is not all.
I also welcome the public service character of Eurocontrol.
This should be seen as just one exercise.
The result of the current practice is delays.
That is better than using European air traffic services.
This is also a very expensive system.
It is always the poor.
It is also vulnerable.
This is absurd!
The Vice-President then set up the high-level working party.
These three factors are of quite major importance.
We do not know.
Eurocontrol.
Privatisation.
I am rather tired of repeating the same thing.
There is no privatisation here.
Civil-military.
There is, however, more room for flexibility.
.
Allow me to make a brief comment on this.
Day and night times vary.
Let us therefore introduce it.
This measure has only been partially implemented so far.
There is a real need for harmonisation.
Thus far, the Directive makes sense.
Why is this so?
I ask the whole House to support these amendments.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
This balanced approach must be retained.
I should like to underline the key challenges.
This principle is also the internal market's keystone.
The initial response was to reject the report.
The proposed text originally contained more than 300 amendments.
I hope those will be taken on board.
Finally, a very brief point on mutual recognition.
I personally believe that mutual recognition already works.
I would like to stress a few points.
Several national laws forbid this type of underhand behaviour.
The consumer will actually suffer on two counts.
Thank you very much.
The debate is adjourned.
Mr President, on a point of order.
We started this debate at 11.30 a.m..
(Loud applause)
They are so safe because they no longer work.
That way, nothing can go wrong.'
The sessional services should get themselves better organised.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament approved the request)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
Mr President, I will be brief.
.
Why, then, should there be a reservation?
Mr President, I need a technician.
We know that we have no faulty Members.
It must be the machine.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
Colleagues, thank you for your cooperation.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
I fully support the need for efficient databases.
Simplification is the key: not complication.
.
I therefore share the rapporteur's conclusions.
I hope that more will be done in future.
.
.
.
So packaging can serve some purpose!
.
This is a naÃ¯ve and dangerous assumption.
.
We should think globally about the intermodality of transport.
.
Geographical fragmentation will make way for economic fragmentation.
.
The British rail service has clearly shown this.
What is needed is quite the opposite.
That is why we have voted against them.
.
The neo-liberal ideology will then triumph over safety.
This approach gets no support from me.
.
All well and good.
.
.
.
The rapporteur's work is not evident.
.
These agreements must be urgently revised or circumvented.
.
We see nothing wrong or unnatural about that.
On the contrary.
We cannot therefore support Mr Stevenson's report.
.
We must not sell this agricultural sector short.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Both Member States and candidate countries have been affected.
Many millions of people are affected.
Some have lost relatives, and many their homes.
We must all do our utmost to help.
Allow me to give just one example.
It has a purpose.
Many people are still missing.
I attached great importance to this.
(Applause)
I believe that this is an important political lesson.
This also applies to the stability pact.
I believe we must be very firm about this.
The financial losses were colossal.
The floods caused fatalities, injuries and distress.
That could also easily happen this time.
France's President Chirac is right, of course.
He deserves great praise for his speech in Johannesburg.
Three things are needed.
To do so is an expression of European solidarity.
Secondly, the legal circumstances need to be created.
That is the question.
Something has happened to the climate.
I believe that that is the case.
Disasters have more than a merely national dimension.
Aid must be visible.
Man-made climate change has arrived.
Commissioner Barnier repeatedly emphasised the need for preventive measures.
We simply have to rebuild in a sustainable way.
The time has come to demonstrate this.
Emergency help is urgently needed.
It was unprecedented.
Three hours later, the shop no longer existed.
Mrs Fiebiger has quoted the figures.
Because make no mistake.
Additional funds cannot be provided in the short term.
Many agencies have been overwhelmed with offers of help.
We have our work cut out for us.
Help is needed.
And urgent help is needed.
But its job is not yet done.
Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
What can we learn from this situation?
Our future is at stake.
It is important to act speedily.
Thank you Minister.
The first measure decided was to use set-aside areas.
This measure is up and running.
This measure is also up and running.
Applications are already being received from the Austrian authorities.
This is the quickest method.
I think this too is highly significant.
But we can also offer greater flexibility.
We need to set this fund up first.
Thank you for your support.
I was there on Thursday.
It is in this spirit that we are working.
We do, however, have a responsibility.
That is the commitment I am giving.
Thank you Commissioner.
I thank those who have contributed to the debate.
This will involve additional administrative expenditure.
The flexibility instrument must not be used.
Particular care was taken
Thank you, Minister.
The Council cut this back slightly.
We welcome that.
I think this reduction should also be reversed.
Preparations need to start now and that takes staff.
Thank you for your attention.
He knows he is always welcome in this House.
But let me reiterate why we did so.
So any criticism can only apply to next year.
I say that because the deal was quite unique.
The President-in-Office mentioned it in his speech.
Let us be clear on our position.
I will leave the rest to the rapporteurs.
Mr Wynn touched upon this.
That is why Parliament repeatedly increases the payments.
New concerns for 2002 included the Global Health Fund.
That is unsustainable in the long term.
We must respect the ceiling for category 5.
Thank you very much, Mr Stenmarck.
The debate is closed.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I
Subject: Specific immigration strand for the MEDA programme
Do any concrete projects exist in this respect?
Are there any projects devoted to women immigrants?
Our approach to migration is comprehensive.
I have no doubt about that.
We must help them deal with that problem.
So there are two blocks.
The first is the question of meat-and-bone meal.
Subject: Crohn's Disease
The Community contribution is EUR 1 639 151.
The project duration is 36 months.
The project continues until October 2003.
Results will be made available at regular intervals.
More information can be found on the website.
This may be the most simple and effective method.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
There is a very well established relationship here.
Part two
Questions to Mr Bolkestein
What might the Commission be able to do?
But the project needs to run until 2035.
Could you perhaps comment on that?
There is nothing wrong with that.
President.
Mr RÃ¼big has asked one.
We are not.
Thank you.
Fine.
Thank you, Mr President.
The jurisprudence is consistent and clear.
Does the Commission have plans for any initiatives here?
That is a good thing.
The jurisprudence is completely clear and consistent.
If necessary, the Commission will initiate proceedings.
Yes, and lack of time.
Questions to Mr Verheugen
Accession negotiations with Cyprus are proceeding as planned.
I should like to put two questions to you.
I agree that I have said nothing new.
Which is something we both regret.
Subject: Cyprus and accession negotiations
You said that Cyprus has made substantial progress.
That is my question.
Subject: Enlargement, women and fundamentalism
I would be grateful if this could be verified.
Subject: Future accession treaties for new Member States
There must be a practical solution.
Mr Schmid, once again please read my lips.
It is perfectly straightforward.
First Mr Crowley and then Mr SeppÃ¤nen.
Mr President, on a point of order.
This issue relates to the Irish referendum.
On this occasion it is crucial.
This is not a debate on the Irish referendum.
I know that he asked to put a question.
Mr Crowley has the floor.
A yes or no answer will do.
How democratic is that?
Questions to Commissioner Vitorino
Subject: Measures to restrict illegal immigration into the Canaries
I have taken note of his observations.
Subject: TEAM experts
They are organised in national groups.
Subject: Visa exemption for Macedonia
.
These criteria are not immutable.
Hence my question to you.
I understand Mr Posselt's concerns perfectly.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
This better complementarity will strengthen the basic political messages.
The Barcelona Council tabled the same demand.
It is not simply better timing.
That is a fundamental flaw in the whole procedure.
I should nonetheless like to address two more matters.
That we do not focus exclusively on employment.
And for my second question.
We all talk about growth and employment.
We have the stability and growth pact.
We have the internal market.
We have the Lisbon process.
I should first like to say something about continuity.
The communication from the Commission takes account of this.
I have a question on the timetable.
Can the Commissioner comment on this?
It is either five or one.
Therefore, this type of incoherence should not arise.
The Stability Pact is part of Community legislation.
This Communication says nothing about this issue.
Secondly, this proposal is just one step.
Thank you Commissioner Diamantopoulou and Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
What is the point of this clause?
Absolutely no-one!
There was not one dissenting voice within the group.
Thank you for listening.
I am afraid I must leave now.
Another brief point: the issue of inflation.
That story is repeated across the European Union.
That world has gone!
This is a crucial measure.
The regulation broaches a number of extremely important issues.
I have two questions for the Commissioner.
Are we to expect anything more?
If so, what?
What else does the Commission have up its sleeve?
Consumers are treated like ignorant, uninformed children.
The Commission finds the compromise acceptable.
Thank you Commissioner Bolkenstein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Not at all.
The draft regulation does not relate to these measures.
That is also reflected in the report.
The same may also be true of other committees.
State aid based on those Articles 87 and 88.
Perhaps we now need to go a step further.
Outsiders find European regulations a great and impenetrable mystery.
Citizens and companies are lost without expert help.
We need both, one presupposes the other.
This is known as sheltered or supported employment.
There are two reasons for this coherence.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
We must have common indicators and a common database.
This is a taboo subject in the twilight zone.
There is a lack of unequivocal data.
This is stated in item 12 of the resolution.
Everyone is in agreement.
Why?
This parent becomes over-protective and exerts too much discipline.
Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea expressed it very well.
It also provides advocacy and public education and research.
It is not going to be rooted out overnight.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
We hope the Commission will support us in this.
The period from 2003 to 2005 is also important.
We look forward to receiving your individual comments.
But it was an important advance.
It seems to me to be short-sighted.
Even for the centre right it makes sense.
I feel there are inadequacies in the scoreboard itself.
Not all the progress has yet been measured.
I usually put forward Mrs Smet's view.
Employment is the European Union's number one priority.
In 2000, the employment rate reached 63.2%.
The committed involvement of the social partners is crucial.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
.
.
Hence my vote in favour of this report.
Iraq
So far, these efforts have been fruitless.
Malnutrition is generally more severe.
The latest contact took place yesterday.
That is something quite specific.
The situation appears to be evolving day by day.
It is not an unreasonable question to ask.
Is there anybody in Parliament who disagrees with that?
Good!
We have a consensus.
We have contributed over EUR 270 million.
In 2002 we shall provide around EUR 13 million.
That is obviously the best way to proceed.
(Applause)
(Applause)
He invaded Kuwait.
There can be only one European approach.
The third question is what the consequences are.
We need to step up our dialogue with America.
(Applause from the right)
These questions are very important for this debate.
You mentioned long-term sanctions.
These are counterproductive.
We believe this is the best way forward.
He drew a line in the sand.
The Union's position is as clear as mud.
That is your job.
There is also another point of view.
Quite remarkable!
That is the key issue for my group.
That is far more important.
That is unsatisfactory as far as I am concerned.
But where is it?
(Applause from the right)
This threat is the culmination of two worrying trends.
This particularly applies to banned weapons of mass destruction.
Yesterday's friends are tomorrow's enemies.
How long is this to continue?
These are today's friends.
Are they also tomorrow's enemies, however?
It has come at an opportune time.
We have to recognise that before we begin.
There must be no unilateral approach.
This proof must be clear and public.
What Commissioner Patten said here this morning is crucial.
Europe is playing a pivotal role.
I would ask for your support in this.
I should like to underline three points.
This is truly what our group unanimously believes.
My second point is one of concern.
The EU voice must be heard.
We have stood silent.
We have first-hand evidence of that.
We have been overflying the south since 1994.
We have that evidence available.
What can we do?
(Applause from the centre and the right)
This is a signal of solidarity.
We need to send the right message.
We almost made a mistake then.
There is no such thing as a clean war.
There are two questions being raised here.
The first concerns the assessment of the threat.
It is very important that we have this evidence.
Secondly, we must have a chance of winning.
That is a genuine question.
We cannot enforce international law by breaking international law.
Let us also be morally consistent.
I suppose that is better than nothing.
The second question was about the broad coalition.
Mr President, Saddam Hussein is evil.
His regime is evil.
His deeds are evil.
He is totally defying the international community.
Even the Pentagon has reservations about a possible attack.
What discussions have been taking place in the Council?
What forward planning has there been?
I do not mean military planning.
This is the reality of the situation.
This military action is about weapons of mass destruction.
For me it chiefly means solidarity within Europe.
We know nothing.
Which position must they adopt?
We want peace in the Middle East.
We want a Palestinian State.
That goes without saying.
That needs to be made crystal clear.
That is a prerequisite.
This also has fundamental implications for future transatlantic relations.
These words have been almost completely disregarded.
What game are we playing?
After that only one alternative: war.
The condemnation of the dictator Saddam Hussein appears unanimous.
This is a major problem.
Secondly, how far does this unanimity extend?
Do we think that these should be unconditional?
Do we think we should set an ultimatum?
Should this ultimatum be set by the UN?
Are we getting any nearer to a solution?
Is the aim to bring down Saddam Hussein?
How many subscribe to Mr SchrÃ¶der's opinion?
A unilateral attack on Iraq would be moral madness.
Nobody but a fantasist would suggest such a thing.
Another bombing of Iraq would be mass murder.
Imperialism equates to war.
In our book, war is banned.
We are brushing all that aside today .
We are completely brushing aside international law.
This is an enormous breach of the law.
(Applause from the Non-attached Members)
The EU supports the UN's efforts.
Those would be very good replies.
Do we simply shrug our shoulders?
What do we do then?
Do we simply wring our hands?
What do we do?
Can you turn that into an acceptable principle?
Does it depend entirely on context?
Does it depend on the nature of the regime?
All those are questions which we cannot duck.
I would like to finish with this thought.
Mr President, on a point of order.
It was a lapsus due to the Convention.
I hope that Commissioner Patten will not be offended.
The debate is closed.
There continues to be inadequate security in the country.
Afghan women played a striking role.
Afghan ownership is another code word.
I am sure we will not.
This brings me to my second point.
Let me turn briefly to the Bonn Agreement.
A further 116 000 have returned from Iran.
I can speak for the European Commission.
Another important selection criterion is dependence on poppy production.
Let me give you a few examples.
We are co-financing a massive mine-clearance operation.
Preparations for implementation of this programme are well advanced.
Commissioner Patten and Mr Haarder talked about the murders.
Lastly, I mentioned the humanitarian situation.
Afghanistan is a very difficult country to help.
He made this very point.
Water.
It has hit many hundreds of thousands of people.
The south-west of Afghanistan is not particularly heavily mined.
They can grow opium poppies in this drought.
Unfortunately, poppies grow extremely well in drought.
Of course it is not being contained.
Water ought to be one of the topmost priorities.
Then, of course, women's rights.
So it is not easy.
Building a democratic society is a long-term commitment.
In Afghanistan, the excuse is not plausible.
Open your eyes, ladies and gentlemen.
I think that we have done the wrong thing.
We will now interrupt the debate for the vote.
Thank you Dr Tannock.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
The rapporteur has asked for the floor.
(Parliament rejected the request for referral to committee)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
I believe Mrs Villiers is in agreement.
.
.
.
That is why I will be voting against it.
Transparency and rules at European level are also important.
.
The report says that unemployment is too high.
Hence our vote against this report.
.
.
This is partly justified.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
There have indeed been changes.
There is now a degree of security in Afghanistan.
This is madness.
There is much to be done in Afghanistan.
We call for respect for international conventions.
I would stress: whoever the accused person is.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Only humanitarian aid has been seen so far.
(Applause on the right)
I agree entirely.
It is a difficult, thankless and dangerous task.
Many had to lose their lives.
Those tributes are wholly justified.
I want to make three other points.
Not all is perfect by any means in Afghanistan.
The next item is the joint debate on:
The number of meetings has also increased.
Mr President, today's debate is extremely timely.
The report is excellent.
There are three basic components to our approach.
I should like to conclude by mentioning three points.
This is no longer acceptable.
We are now a year on.
They are both interdependent.
Across the world?
This is the only way I can describe it.
His words inspire confidence.
Democratic rule of law is central in Asia too.
Thank you very much, Mr Maaten.
The third is the problem of migration.
That is something that Parliament has long desired.
On that you have our support.
With these reservations, we support the report.
Asia is not only huge in terms of area.
This has been achieved, however.
I shall just highlight a couple of points here.
Let us consider Tibet.
Tibet has its own history and culture.
Tibet was occupied by China in the 1950s.
No longer is autonomy even mentioned.
Nuclear war has been threatened.
Attempts to resolve the conflict have been unsuccessful.
I should like to raise two points.
I will start on a critical note.
This problem cannot be addressed here.
All this seems to me to be completely incredible.
The WHO is a community of independent states.
It cannot get up off the ground unaided.
We must not forget this country.
I have some experience of environmental issues.
I should now like to turn to dialogue-related issues.
We managed to agree on a joint communiquÃ©.
We managed to agree on all three.
Global warming is the most important question.
More cooperation is needed in this area.
Our political ties need to be strengthened and broadened.
This is a positive point.
I really do consider that important.
It is an excellent document.
I would strongly question that.
I have visited these refugee camps.
Mr Pannella has tabled an amendment to this effect.
It therefore works.
One final word.
We need both of them!
Let me pick out a number of proposals.
That is an achievement in itself.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
The debate is closed.
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
The Charter is of a different character.
It is aimed at the implementation of Union law.
That is something I should like to emphasise.
The reports are there to be found and read.
Subject: Southern Africa and serious food shortages
It was published in November of last year.
An evaluation report is to be presented in 2004.
Subject: Seville European Council agreements
Subject: Separation of powers
Should executive and legislative powers be separate?
If not, why not?
Would he have the same influence and capacity?
It will not be affected by any shadow.
Subject: Discrimination against Greeks in Albania
The committee has not completed its work.
The constitution envisages that a solution will be found.
The situation will be monitored continuously and closely.
Perhaps he thinks his questioners are stupid.
How dare he reply like that.
What does he take us for?
I repeat: this must not set a precedent.
Subject: Free movement of persons in the Schengen zone
We must protect democratic gatherings.
That is something we owe to democracy.
That is good, of course.
That also applies to pre-accession programmes.
What number were you working with in your forecasts?
I cannot.
Otherwise, we cannot carry out any advance planning.
We are not going to start a debate now.
We do not have the classification by gender.
I very much regret that.
Subject: Future accession treaties for new Member States
Several Members have asked to speak.
Mr Crowley has the floor for a supplementary question.
My question follows that one.
Subject: Better regulation
I should like to have given a clear answer.
It is precisely that which is to be discussed.
Subject: Measures to restrict illegal immigration into the Canaries
This also falls under conclusion No 30.
Of course, this will have to be discussed.
What is the current situation concerning the MNEPR?
I hope this answers Mrs Astrid Thors's question.
Subject: Tackling Drugs
This is Question No 15 by Mr Fitzsimons.
No, sorry, just a moment.
The question was from Mr Crowley.
Question No 16 has been withdrawn.
I can say no more.
Thank you, Mr President.
Progress has also been made in clearing mines.
Can we delegate to the local and national authorities?
How shall we proceed in the future?
That is the message from the Committee on Budgets.
That has not even started to happen in Kosovo!
The agency is doing a good and essential job.
All this must be borne in mind.
The agency is indeed a success story.
That is certainly our approach.
In the report you emphasise the need for coordination.
We share this view.
Our preliminary thoughts are as follows.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Second: the lack of information.
Fourth: diplomatic and consular protection.
Fifth: protection of the citizens.
First, the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Much, then, lies ahead of us.
Mr Coelho adopts a fully justified tone of impatience.
Information documents must become more available.
We must improve this situation.
What can we say about the mobility of researchers?
The Convention must also not forget this.
I regard myself as a citizen of the world.
It seems to me that is a mistake.
All this is perfectly true.
However, this requires a clearer, simpler Treaty.
That is a distortion of the truth.
This political pickpocketing is at once antidemocratic and repressive.
I fully agree.
In the general approach alone there are already differences.
Moreover, that alone is not enough.
Here are some of them.
Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez also raised a very important matter.
The Commission therefore fully supports Amendment No 15.
I turn now to access to justice.
This is dealt with under the common position.
The Commission therefore cannot accept those amendments.
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m.)
Recent serious problems concerning food safety in the EU
The impact has been particularly severe in the Netherlands.
Where were the checks and the monitoring?
How often is a blind eye turned to wrongdoing?
I have faith in our new food safety measures.
(Applause from the right)
Why should that be?
Because of our agricultural policy, of course.
He is quite right.
So what can we change about the system?
Yes, we need tough legislation on feed hygiene.
What is the situation with legislation on waste?
Yes, there is indeed proper waste legislation.
Are there proper controls in the Member States?
Is that too much to ask?
No, it is not too much to ask!
I am grateful for that.
We need to have other controls on animal protein.
What kind of inspections does it carry out precisely?
How often are they carried out?
Is there room for improvement?
Would the Commission be able to comment on this?
Another issue is production in Europe itself.
This is referred to as 'integrated production'.
What exactly is integrated production in a European context?
Then we would be able to trace everything promptly.
We are talking here about antibiotics and cocciodiostatic drugs.
They want it all.
I do not know.
It is down to the farmers.
Who monitors this?
What about product liability legislation?
Just looking certainly is not enough.
It will not help at all.
You cannot just turn your back on this problem.
I shall say something about that.
Mr Bowis made reference to growth promoters.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made a number of relevant points.
They are all associated with the feed issue.
Mr Mulder referred to the Food and Veterinary Office.
Mr Mulder mentioned a quality mark.
This may be valuable but it has its limitations.
Clearly, they failed to respect this requirement.
The problems have occurred at the national level.
Thank you Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
I shall outline them here very quickly.
Informal learning is precisely what this is all about.
We could incorporate the latter by recognising informal learning.
And this is exactly what we need to avoid.
My second point is funding.
My third point concerns the European area.
We try to coordinate but do little else.
Education budgets are being cut at the moment.
We should prioritise the most important items of expenditure.
Instead, long training programmes are required.
That is something we can learn from .
You spoke, Commissioner, of the digital divide.
This digital divide applies mainly to women.
This description is also true in a negative sense.
This receives my warm support.
I still have two minor observations to make.
This should be of particular concern.
I subscribe to the need for lifelong learning.
Something would need to change there too.
So we can learn from each other.
We should extend education centres.
The rapporteur has proposed individual learning accounts.
That needs to be developed.
This is what we must concentrate on.
One consideration is training and another is teaching.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Certain shortcomings must, nevertheless, be mentioned.
My second point is about the Lisbon objectives.
Perhaps we could use that in future.
Thank you, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Why is it necessary to produce this report?
There is a certain contradiction in Europe.
What are we asking for in the report?
They must be helped.
I would like to focus on sport.
Administratively, many stumbling blocks could be removed.
Ladies and gentlemen, universities are not grocery stores.
Madam President, I very much welcome this initiative.
Providing an optional language is very important.
This is also the case with the European Union.
I do not think it is.
These are all excellent initiatives.
European civilisation has created diversity in all areas.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
We wish her a very enjoyable stay.
.
.
This was never successful.
These people are now second-class citizens.
We have had governance, an unidentified political subject.
Your artificial citizenship has no substance whatsoever.
The report therefore has no purpose.
.
.
.
The other reason is economic interest.
Such decisions must not be taken without consultation.
This development is, of course, welcome.
In Asia, 250 people have died this year.
First of all, solidarity can have no borders.
.
This is no coincidence.
This is necessary but unsatisfactory.
.
.
(NL) Afghanistan is a sort of Switzerland.
This has mainly resulted in death and destruction.
The resolution falls between two stools.
However, I am genuinely concerned about this issue.
This country has experienced a huge refugee problem.
.
.
Not only in Kosovo but also in Serbia.
This has now been proposed, and rightly so.
The EU is playing with fire.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Human rights are universal and transcend all borders.
This sentence therefore undermines the cooperation treaty.
He should be released immediately.
There should be a fair appeal process.
We are friends of Egypt.
We must encourage dialogue.
When dialogue fails, we must bring forward sanctions.
The damage has been done.
We are not talking today about tough regimes.
We are in close touch with the family.
We can only agree with that.
Thank you very much indeed, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
There are many people who recognise no god whatsoever.
Europe is opposed to the death penalty.
Human rights organisations are bravely fighting in Nigeria.
We must support their demands.
Nigeria is a very fragile and unstable democracy.
It is simply a fundamentalist interpretation.
That is the only honourable way to proceed.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This is a travesty.
That is the reality.
Nevertheless, he still finds sympathy in black Africa.
The European Union must therefore play its own role.
That really takes the biscuit!
That is the real background to this.
Quite the opposite.
Was Europe really silent on this?
What should we be doing?
We should do what we have decided to do.
It is an appalling litany of crimes against humanity.
Further financial and targeted sanctions must be vigorously imposed.
Mr President, just a few words.
That was the official reasoning.
I know Zimbabwe reasonably well.
That is no exaggeration of the position.
The Commission deplores this.
The report itself makes extremely disturbing reading.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
I declare this sitting of the European Parliament closed.
(The sitting was closed at 4.25 p.m.)
This infringes academic freedom and the principle of subsidiarity.
Resumption of the session
He is in Ireland on personal business.
The following change has been proposed:
Wednesday:
I note your point about the resolution of April.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Applause from the right)
I have checked his information with the Commission.
Therefore Mr Heaton-Harris got his facts wrong.
(Applause from the left)
Europe and its citizens are a much-debated topic.
There is nobody on standby in the Netherlands.
What sustains them is grass-roots support.
Mr President, on a point of order.
That is surely something we should be doing.
I would like to share with you my astonishment.
I hope so.
That is the lesson of the 20th Century!
(Applause from the right)
With or without the blessing of the UN.
There is no resistance from Parliament.
That concludes this item.
That is not enough.
That is urgently needed.
Indeed, this is enshrined in the Irish Constitution.
I am sure we can find one.
We already have an independent judicial training network.
This particular initiative has been overtaken.
We should draw some lessons from that.
This is deplorable.
All this is lacking at European level
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.
It is really two reports in one.
We welcome the open coordination method.
We want high standards.
We want best practice to be followed.
Our group has other reasons for rejecting the report.
Of course, we want Community procedures for asylum.
How, then, do matters look in reality?
The message is clear.
That is something with which I agree.
Pressure on the asylum system is indeed considerable.
Many asylum seekers are knocking on Europe's doors.
That strikes me as a futile exercise.
Is this desirable for the European Union?
Moreover, it would not solve anything.
There is no easy solution to this problem.
This is a true paradox.
Expelling them would therefore uproot them once again.
Let me make some comments on specific points.
We addressed them in separate documents.
For once you cannot blame the Commission.
The open coordination method does not go against legislation.
That would go against the principle of subsidiarity.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.
A number of different funding possibilities exist.
That is the opinion of the Parliamentary committee.
What is sought by many victim-support organisations is harmonisation.
All this is covered by this Green Paper.
In 1999, 250 million people did so.
It is a very good report.
However, we have done ourselves some damage.
This is particularly about cross-border disputes.
However, I should introduce one correction.
I congratulate both rapporteurs on these excellent reports.
Many thanks!
Let me start with victim support.
The debate is closed.
These 37 Members have since withdrawn their opposition.
The Commission's proposal was a good one.
Such fat is particularly nauseating.
It has been both enjoyable and inspiring.
It is important that this work now be concluded.
In the UK catering waste is banned.
In the UK this was a thriving cottage industry.
That meant it went down the drain.
This is all to the good.
The second area is the question of cooking oil.
This is a pretty repulsive habit.
We also recommend approval of the joint draft.
Enterprises need guarantees in order to plan ahead.
Food traceability has been improved.
Lastly, we are preventing cross-contamination.
We must speed up the process.
What becomes of it then?
The outcome is a respectable one.
Rules are therefore laid down on destruction.
But not if it is sterilised.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
and
The European Union must fulfil its international obligations.
The proposal consists of the following main parts.
The actual exporter shall always be responsible for notification.
This topic has been discussed among the Christian-Democrats.
These are unnecessary restrictions, in my view.
We have to focus on that.
I consider this to be an excellent guiding principle.
Mr SjÃ¶stedt's report therefore receives my warm support.
I am, of course, being ironic.
Which procedure should be chosen to authorise these products?
Why is it such a problem?
Those are the goodies.
This is the wrong way to view the situation.
This must be included in the Protocol.
We all stand for an environmentally responsible market economy.
The consumer must therefore be informed of GMOs.
Cheese and olive oil are prime examples of this.
I should like to ask the Commission a question.
Would this increase the EU's deficit?
The precautionary principle must be the guiding principle.
There is no other way.
That is something we must not go and lose.
We can never have too much safety.
I support this report in its entirety.
It was absolutely beautiful!
The area was called Bagnoli.
Even we have our uses.
That is the situation that applies.
Regular negotiations are under way.
Other areas have been clarified.
We cannot adopt that amendment.
Of course we are not.
I want to begin with a general comment.
Amendment No 29 addresses more fundamental problems.
This part of the amendment cannot therefore be approved.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at noon today.
This ban had a definite deadline - 1998.
Nonetheless, what you are doing is illegal!
I could use old-fashioned language and call it daft!
You want to pass a measure with retroactive effect.
We are already at the end of September.
We will not let you have your precedent!
We are not good little lambs!
This resolution makes that very clear.
We call upon you not to implement this measure.
Tell them that we are serious about this.
Some of us are too.
We are an elected institution.
We have certain powers.
They have been extended.
But what happens in the meantime?
What happens if this conciliation fails?
We are talking of something quite different.
What has happened to the sixth revision?
That is what everyone is wondering.
I thank you for your support.
Of course we are considering the industry's interests.
How more accommodating can one be?
Yes, I am happy to wait a moment.
That is what you have heard today.
Thank you.
That is the aim of this postponement.
That is the background to the Commission proposal.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your additional intervention.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
When will this matter be finally cleared up?
On the contrary, such a thing is impossible.
Thank you, Mr President.
I share his relentless ambition to improve agricultural controls.
What is the essence of the Commission's proposal?
The proof will be in the pudding.
However, what exactly are good agricultural practices?
This is the essence.
We know that a great deal goes wrong.
Why?
Fear of public access?
So that cannot be the stumbling block.
I am afraid that this is the case.
Mr Mulder constantly hides behind this argument.
This problem will become more pressing following enlargement.
For this is desperately needed.
And the Commissioner thinks that this is satisfactory.
Why is this a State secret?
How much are they receiving?
For what purpose?
What aspect of this needs to remain secret?
This is what is happening to milk producers.
This makes no sense at all!
I cannot accept this, Commissioner!
Mr Casaca was right to express concerns about irregularities.
This is very important.
The first one concerns the legal basis.
I have three points to make.
That is why the Commission rejects this amendment.
Its arguments are well known.
It is about all these things.
Let us get back to our cattle.
We will bring this issue up again.
These are key areas.
But the most important issue here today is transparency.
We need to crack this open.
That is what we are asking for.
This is a fact.
There are innumerable examples quoted here.
We concluded an agreement in this respect.
Surely that is impossible.
common agricultural policy.
This is definitely one of the important elements.
Thank you, Mr Swoboda for your kind words.
Thank you, Mr van Hulten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the vote.
The rapporteur is Mr Mulder.
It is certainly not technical!
There is still much to do, though.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Applause from the left)
That is a disappointment for this House.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
(Applause from the left)
I do not want to start a debate.
.
Water transport is the poor transport relation.
The European fleet has shrunk.
Fewer people want to become seafarers.
The EU has lost 40% of its sailors.
By 2006 the EU will need 36,000 sailors.
Sea transport is operating below capacity.
It can offer a real alternative to land transport.
.
Hence our vote against the report.
I would support his analysis as a whole.
.
.
It should remain this way.
.
It is also extremely detailed.
Why is that?
Four: the public must be fully informed.
.
This is a serious matter.
The same goes for its responsibility.
The resolution continued in the same vein.
Why has this happened?
.
I have spent all my money.
What a beautiful lady Mrs Roth-Behrendt is!
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Together we will win the battle against terrorism.
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr MacCormick has the floor.
Are there any other comments, ladies and gentlemen?
(The Minutes were approved thus amended)
Is that true?
What amounts do we need?
That is a temporary solution.
We need much more flexibility.
Only 15 months remain until the beginning of 2004.
Enlargement has the highest priority.
That is what we call frontloading.
Allow me to mention just two.
These will be areas of major concern in 2003.
A new instrument has now been created for this.
My group welcomes this new procedure.
These include the implementation of the early retirement scheme.
All this will need proper preparation.
This must also show itself in the budget.
Thirdly, there is the issue of work creation.
This continent still has too many people unemployed.
We have submitted amendments on that subject.
Thank you for your attention.
Our group supports preparations for enlargement to the east.
In exchange it obtained provisional budgetary unity.
It got a very good deal.
The programme was agreed upon without any formal settlement.
It would be regrettable if this were the case.
Allow me to make one final point.
Thank you, Mr President.
From now on, we all share the responsibility.
Thank you, Mr President and Mr Pedersen.
Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner Barnier.
Will it have done so by 2003?
What are the deadlines for this work?
Thank you, Mr President.
They need the money that is kept in Brussels.
Both, then, are to blame.
This is a good example, though.
Secondly, I should like to mention B3-4314.
We are looking to renew this line once again.
My final point concerns B3-4106.
This is one reason.
We should also mention the new payment system.
The ball is in the European Parliament's court.
Last night, the Council held a trialogue meeting.
I would like to convince you of their importance.
Thank you, Commissioner Barnier.
I am very glad that the Commission accepts this.
However, we are not succeeding.
That is a very small sum indeed.
No change is required this year, then.
Why is this, Commissioner?
We want to improve control at external borders.
That is how it should be too.
Firstly, security and enlargement.
Great changes and challenges are ahead of us.
We are all open to that criticism.
That brings me back to cultural policy.
Bureaucracy in this area is simply unmanageable.
It is far too weak.
Is there to be a multi-annual plan?
The 5 million was not proposed again this year.
No one can question the priority given to Afghanistan.
That is why we proposed a new approach.
No one can.
In my view, this evidence cannot be contested.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
We have two problems here.
In this context, standardisation is essential and fundamental.
So let's do our homework here first.
AIDS is a global problem.
Secondly, the quality of aid.
I look forward to hearing his response.
Secondly, we want more transparency.
The second issue is nuclear safety.
These are our priorities.
He will make a statement on this issue shortly.
Remarks were made about staffing and security in delegations.
The Committee on Budgets needs to know a figure.
That would not be efficient.
We do not have a figure right now.
(Applause from the left)
Take Vietnam, for example.
There are other countries in a similar situation.
For this more money is needed right away.
Another good example is the Northern Dimension.
A third example is nuclear safety.
For that we are proposing EUR 25 million.
We all understand why.
I have a question for the Commission.
I then have a question for the Council.
That weakens the credibility of our foreign policy.
Can you give us your opinion on this?
What is your solution?
This is a high proportion.
Now to the issue of TACIS.
We are changing this gradually.
I could not agree more.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The first aspect concerns the Prince programme.
The other aspect concerns the Internet.
Nonetheless, this framework is still quite important.
I think this situation is open to severe criticism.
There is much frustration among active Europeans.
I ask for your support.
Employment is an important issue.
Unemployment is on the increase in the EU.
We would like to extend this list.
What does this mean in practice?
This is an untenable situation, in my view.
Why are we continuing along this absurd path?
My proposal is, therefore, as follows.
The President-in-Office is already aware of my request.
I find this very disappointing.
However, there are two issues that concern us.
What a daft idea!
Why?
Budget heading A-3021 bears ample witness to this.
It lists some organisations but not others.
That is a tragedy.
The Commission has put forward a different proposal here.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
That is an urgent requirement.
The financial perspective must be amended.
We would therefore like to support this.
The name has been changed.
You are familiar with the issues.
This is the EUR 27 million.
This would have an impact on the 2003 budget.
It would require the Treaties to be amended accordingly.
Neither of these proposals can be right today.
It would send out the wrong signal.
This is after all unquestionably a proposal for debate.
I should also like to mention this once more.
This too is a very important question.
Two events are particularly important.
The second is the draft mid-term review.
An absolute distinction must be drawn between these events.
Nor is that the aim.
It should be rejected for this reason alone...
This has negative consequences also for urban areas.
We must not aim for the wrong target.
The Committee on Fisheries insists on this being done.
Secondly, we are facing far-reaching decisions.
That should be enough!
The first is tobacco subsidies.
My next question concerns the Food Safety Authority.
(The President cut the speaker off)
What are the costs of those options?
The same, incidentally, applies to sugar.
Research has to be addressed within the research budget.
I am very pleased with this result.
Thank you for your attention.
We have never done anything like this before.
In the main it has been successful.
I should also like to thank the President-in-Office.
It has never been done before.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Written declaration (Rule 120)
A few words on each of them.
Firstly, this programme must strike a proper balance.
I would commend the report to the House.
I am a civil engineer by background.
We must ensure that this scheme is properly monitored.
That is where much improvement can take place.
I applaud everyone involved in this very forward-thinking scheme.
Here, less is more!
Not only alternative modes of transport deserve incentives.
I hope that our governments will follow suit.
The objective is positive.
Does anyone here understand this language?
Why must we do that?
Firstly, because we must tackle pollution.
Secondly, we must tackle congestion.
40 per cent of freight already goes by sea.
Marco Polo will make a difference there.
Mr President, I welcome Mr Bradbourn's report.
I therefore value this line of approach.
This is extremely important.
We must therefore focus more on transport prevention.
Marco Polo is a very important project to us.
Therein lies the problem.
These measures will be of significant help to SMEs.
Mr President, I welcome this excellent initiative.
Let us not get carried away here.
Can you detect any improvements yet, Commissioner?
For I cannot.
Europe will make an utter fool of itself.
More funding would be a more reasonable suggestion.
The Council may propose a lowering of the amount.
The Commission rejects these amendments or parts of them.
Let me briefly explain the position.
We need fewer but larger projects with real impact.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
It must become much more effective.
This pattern must be broken.
My answer is clear and unambiguous.
That is an incredibly important issue.
New jobs and more employment must be created.
I wonder what happened to the social process.
The method is still in its infancy.
What will their scope be?
Last year there were 13 million.
We must not become accustomed to these high figures.
What does this involve?
Gender-specific discrimination must therefore be combated energetically.
Progress has definitely been made in the Member States.
Let me give you an example.
Agreed!
That would be wrong.
He has been very constructive.
Big improvements have taken place.
Unemployment is still too high.
There are also big regional differences within Europe.
All these factors must be improved in the future.
That must not happen.
It is also important to involve other actors.
What ought therefore to happen?
It is the correct path to go down.
That is not something we can support.
Allow me to give a few pertinent examples.
Thousands of Vivendi group employees are anxious.
I should like to make a few critical observations.
I will mention two.
This is an underdeveloped area.
I think this is urgently required.
This means balancing things out, in my view.
No-one has yet mentioned that people create jobs.
What does it really mean?
The fourth point concerns competitiveness.
Firstly, we need to narrow down the guidelines.
Amongst these weaknesses I would highlight:
the low level of training,
the significant effects of long-term and extremely long-term unemployment,
a sectoral and entrepreneurial structure with serious shortcomings,
low productivity,
considerable regional inequalities.
We also want the guidelines actually to be implemented.
For once this too needs to be clearly stated.
Entrepreneurship and adaptability are still judged to be deficient.
Commissioner, my group stands by your side.
Is it a matter of subsidiarity?
And then there are women.
The househusband is viewed with suspicion.
I would like to focus on three points.
The employment situation is deteriorating.
It is a combination of competitiveness and cohesion.
Important and serious proposals and approaches have been voiced.
The third point is involvement.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I shall now turn to the report.
Women are underrepresented in these.
I maintain that they are not representative.
Hence the report.
It is therefore essential to set up a database.
Hence our theory.
So what can we do at European level?
Thank you very much, Mrs Bastos.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.48 p.m.)
.
The Commission proposal warrants our vote.
.
This is why I voted against the report.
This budget is simultaneously delightful, detrimental and disastrous.
Delightful because of the amount: EUR 100 billion.
Detrimental with regard to agriculture.
Outcome of World Summit on Sustainable Development
The next item is the joint debate on:
We faced a great challenge.
The private sector will be more involved.
These words must be turned into deeds.
I will mention five.
This means delegations must reach consensus.
Not everybody gets everything.
Let me address trade issues in more detail.
I have noted some concerns here.
The negotiations were indeed difficult.
Doha dealt with trade in November 2001.
Monterrey dealt with financing in March 2002.
This helped Johannesburg succeed.
The multilateral agenda was better organised for Johannesburg.
There are plenty of things to report here:
The relevant Doha provisions are quoted throughout the text.
That is not a bad result.
That is what I will do.
There was no deviation from established practice in Johannesburg.
I think I should repeat this.
There was no deviation from established practice in Johannesburg.
The Commission did its best to support the parliamentarians.
Now a few words on follow-up.
We are not starting from scratch.
The EU must continue to take the lead.
The EU clearly came with the longest wish list.
NGOs and the press focus on these shortcomings.
So be it.
In this connection, I will naturally emphasise aid.
There are few who actually come up to it.
Transport remains the biggest problem.
Less embarrassing are the local examples.
I would put it on the negative side.
One of these fingers is our agricultural policy.
Has any progress been made in this ambitious area?
Have old objectives been confirmed?
Will we go into action worldwide?
It is high time we did!
It could have been worse.
These too are all firmly on the agenda.
We also welcome the commitment concerning gender mainstreaming.
This is beyond me.
A true world player.
A trend setter.
The EU set the agenda time and again.
We also have some criticism.
I shall not go into any more detail.
(The President cut the speaker off)
And, basically, considerably more was needed.
Firstly, monitoring is not sufficient.
Secondly, we must stop export subsidies on agriculture.
Do global summits still have a role?
Yes and no.
Kyoto was at least able to formulate an objective.
On a point of order, Mr President.
Now it is the turn of the MEPs!
I am quite aware of that.
Mr President, we are totally in your hands.
We can do this in whatever way you want.
Mr President, three preliminary matters.
USD 50 billion of state aid is not much.
There are already more than 1 200!
How much do we stand to gain?
Investing in sustainable energy is costly, but rewarding.
Thirdly, a flagship is what is needed.
Something along the lines of the Airbus project.
Rarely enough are there real political decisions.
That is Johannesburg's appeal to the world.
Johannesburg was unerring in recognising that.
Fish stocks are to recover by 2015.
Now we have to get a move on.
How?
How will progress from Johannesburg onwards be achieved?
It is not clear.
Similarly the regional and local level are important.
We must continue to resist it.
Mr President, the previous speaker referred to Voltaire.
What we arrived at in Johannesburg is not sufficient.
Most of this is carbon technology.
Unfortunately we do not have the instruments.
None of us is satisfied with the results.
Will Parliament receive reports on development?
Now for the actual question.
I should also like to thank the Danish Presidency.
We must create a wider support.
This balance was not struck.
That is a fact.
And why not?
Why was there a preventive approach?
What does this bode for the future?
Why were the United States so insistent?
Instead, nothing was done.
Why?
Which is the very essence of governance.
Governance means no more and no less.
I suggest and request that we think hard.
Mr President, let us not mince our words.
Johannesburg was not a success.
We must, however, search our own conscience.
We can start with this in Europe.
Volkswagen is already doing this.
Another example is deforestation.
This is hardly a balance, therefore.
When will this happen?
I have two points to make in this regard.
So there is something included in that.
I have noted it.
So things are making progress.
Certain deadlines were set.
Now it is a matter of follow-up.
The Commission is looking forward to this.
All this is quite positive.
We are moving into new terrain.
We are firmly in the realm of intergovernmental work.
Everybody talks about the international society.
That is where we are.
That is the raw material that creates results.
This is not how it is in reality.
It is extremely important to move closer to reality.
We could neither add nor subtract anything.
All that is now part of the Doha track.
That would have strengthened cooperation.
Mrs Evans stressed the importance of enforcing monitoring.
We ended up with something acceptable.
This was an unwelcome drama.
I have covered some of the aspects.
I will now speak Swedish for a little while.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
I have received a motion for a resolution
.
The collective failure amounts to a loss of credibility.
Species are disappearing and habitats are being lost forever.
You are all very welcome to attend.
The next item is the vote.
(The President declared the common position approved)
(The President declared the common position approved)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
I am sure the House will agree to that.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Report Smet (A5-0279/2002)
Rights are, and shall remain, individual.
This is up to them and their members.
.
The interests of female employees must not be ignored.
Tax is a matter for Member States.
.
The most important points are:
.
This whole directive was really about cross-border legal aid.
Unfortunately we do not.
The world has changed since 1950.
This is the pressing issue we now face.
.
Three years ago, this ambition was officially abandoned.
Parliament does not have co-decision in the open coordination.
As a Swedish Christian Democrat I cannot support this.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
We welcome both Mr MÃ¸ller and Mr Yiannitsis.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
As mentioned, I will start with Afghanistan.
Unfortunately, Afghanistan still faces very difficult challenges.
A number of concrete steps have already been taken.
This logically leads me on to Iraq.
The country must comply with these obligations immediately.
The EU has fully supported this demand.
The Arab countries gave the proposal a positive reception.
Now we have had these serious setbacks.
We will face new challenges in connection with enlargement.
We all know that.
Unfortunately, this proposal has still not been developed.
The picture today has changed dramatically.
Afghanistan is an issue I remain seriously concerned about.
Then there were the despicable suicide bombings.
The pressure for elections must be maintained.
This is a very positive sign of parliamentary life.
We must address its causes.
How much longer must this go on?
Thank you very much!
It is one of the great European political successes.
(Applause)
(Applause from the left)
This particularly applies with regard to Iraq.
I cannot comprehend this!
Today, you unfortunately fell far short of them.
(Applause from the left)
This is its first argument.
Once again suicide bombers attacked in Israel.
Palestinian children were targeted in their schoolyard in Hebron.
The siege of the Palestinian Presidency compound is counterproductive.
Their ability to survive is constantly undermined.
They are stalked by poverty.
Attack and counter-attack are leading nowhere.
The parties must move forward.
The conflict must end.
This must be our resolve.
It also ties in with military capabilities.
That is what makes the Convention so very important.
(Applause from the right)
We welcome that.
He has once again used disproportionate force.
Did Mr Sharon make the slightest political gesture?
(Applause from the left)
We must be clear in our demands and values.
My group also fully supports Mr Titley's report.
Yes, when will it end?
What we are witnessing here is a colonial war.
(Applause from the left)
This is in contravention of the Code of Conduct.
(The President cut the speaker off)
How much credibility can Europe claim, though?
Europe's voice often cannot be heard.
You have proposed absolutely nothing!
Once again, this method is showing its limitations.
The USA is unilaterally prioritising military security policy.
It is our strength to move into this field.
I have read them in detail.
There is not a shred of evidence.
Why is that?
This represents a serious misconception and analytical error.
I urge you to excel yourself for once.
The choice is yours.
That must be our objective!
We should have acted earlier.
Some Members of this House have a reflex anti-Americanism.
The Brok report reveals a different set of motives.
I disagree with this.
Does that mean we have no profile?
However, they all have one thing in common.
So what does that prove?
What are these general principles?
First, respect for the European political culture.
Secondly, respect for international law.
Parliament is right about this.
I really do not think so.
It cannot end in any other way.
That is the message we constantly convey.
He will not achieve his objectives in that way.
This has been said quite clearly.
It is about complying with the Security Council.
Thank you.
Stop this massacre!
You have the power to do so.
Rather, they are continuing.
The European Union fully supports the Court.
We note a particular gap among Asian States.
We disagree with the United States about the Court.
So be it.
There is an obvious challenge in doing that.
That is precisely our group's position.
The principle behind this Treaty is plain and simple.
We must get our own house in order.
I entirely agree with him.
The Council is working on a compromise.
This is where my group draws the line.
It will rather antagonise them.
The Criminal Court would rather benefit from depoliticisation.
Temporary compromises should therefore not be ruled out.
This follows on from the criteria of Copenhagen.
The resolution is sufficiently clear.
This is less so for Europeans.
This should be sufficient guarantee for the US too.
I have my doubts.
I believe that both of these approaches are wrong.
This is wrong!
There is a principle of subsidiarity.
That is of course the principle.
That is of course the crucial point.
That will not happen.
The answer is yes.
The question we are asking has three parts.
What are the Mercosur countries saying about this?
It would be foolish to do otherwise.
Let me make one final brief point.
I do not wish to repeat it all.
We should discuss this openly.
The problem is cultural and serious.
Mercosur has everything it needs.
The report proposes a two-stage approach.
Mention is also made of vapour pressure.
These are very technical matters.
That examination would take place in 2005.
Sulphur-free fuel is absolutely vital for this purpose.
This seriously harms the competitiveness of those mixtures.
We now talk about 10 ppm sulphur-free.
This is therefore regrettable.
No exemption is required for so-called sulphur-free diesel.
I will support those higher standards.
That is what I oppose.
What do the people say?
Why do we not use common sense?
That is what I support.
I will certainly be voting against this recommendation tomorrow.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I hope it will consider that issue very carefully.
There are broadly two categories of amendments.
Again it would be a barrier to trade.
It is completely self-defeating to impose unachievable limits.
Nowhere else is the exchange of pollutants so great.
The technology, Mr Callanan, is available.
This matter is important for us Finns.
There are technical aspects.
The same logic should apply to boats as well.
Why is that?
The new technology is in place.
We suggest that Member States consider this.
Unfortunately this is not true.
There are more than 182 000 lakes in Finland.
There are 647 rivers.
It has to be anchored in reality.
There is therefore sufficient room for manoeuvre here.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
To date, there have been no such developments.
That is my answer to the question.
However, I grasped the main points.
That is one of the reasons.
That is why we asked these questions.
There is of course nothing wrong with the Internet.
We promote it.
This cannot be the intention of trademark law either.
I also thank the Commissioner for his reply.
I shall tell him what has changed.
What has that done?
So why should this be any different?
I have to disagree with my colleague Mrs Fourtou.
It is a circular argument.
That market is confined to the European Union.
That is obvious.
However, they are not the only ones involved.
I accept Mr Mayer's apologies.
He said the studies are of insufficient quality.
I do not accept that.
She has cited the United States and Japan.
The Commission agrees with her view.
We do not have all the answers yet.
We shall wait for them to come in.
We shall analyse them.
Only those who have no ideas never change them.
It is always willing to reconsider.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.35 p.m.)
Three of these call for special mention.
This was included as Article 41 of the Charter.
I thank you.
He deserves his retirement!
And there are very specific reasons why not.
Parliament examines three reports every year.
Obviously these problems will increase with enlargement.
I should like to mention some of them.
Not all the institutions have acted in that way.
It will be circulated shortly.
It is impossible to defend that before the citizens.
The time for that is certainly getting very close.
I know that is the case.
Let us recall the delayed payments.
We have a lot to do in this area.
There is a window of opportunity this autumn.
What is the way out?
That needs very serious consideration in future.
The present system does not provide legal protection.
.
It is difficult to sustain optimism, however.
Her name is Marta Andreasen.
There is a long way to go.
This week has found us observing its fiftieth anniversary.
I welcome that.
The concept of supranational law is a Roman achievement.
It cannot be restored.
I will end on a very personal note.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Fine.
Let us now consider the organisation of the negotiations.
Public services are essential factors in the social model ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is particularly important.
We have to proceed with caution and with flexibility.
We want to see CAP reform being discussed.
The Commission is wrong there.
These countries have weak and vulnerable economies.
Two years after Cotonou, this would be welcome.
Maintaining them would be suicidal.
What are these barriers?
Instead of developing, these countries have become poorer.
First, capacity.
Agricultural produce is a large element of ACP exports.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
(Applause)
Minimum regulations are a better instrument for promoting development.
.
.
.
We got rid of a wall in Europe.
Numerous conferences have taken place since then.
.
.
.
Well, that is not the case.
How far is Europe prepared to go?
.
In the name of what is it doing so?
.
That is why we have voted against this resolution.
.
We should take a further look at these investments.
.
Hence our vote against.
.
What a paradox!
We say no to war.
We want peace, de-escalation and disarmament.
.
.
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
But I wanted to say something quite different.
That is a parliamentary right and it is non-negotiable.
This afternoon we have just one more debate.
(The Minutes were approved)
How can we achieve this objective?
That is the point of this resolution.
We have mentioned a single standard.
We have consistently avoided the word simple.
We do not want to jump the gun.
We need more clear political signals here.
This common voluntary procedure needs clear signals from us.
I do not think it will come to that.
We need to meet each other half way.
I think that is the answer expected of us.
This question was developed entirely within their committee.
That is far from the reality.
That is not realistic.
They are critical.
We are not there to do that.
Each of those has a different interface.
What were the two core elements?
I therefore emphatically support what Mrs Hieronymi has said.
We really do need a deadline.
Thank you for your friendly show of agreement.
I do not qualify as an average person.
(Applause)
As Mr Posselt said and as Mrs Echerer said.
(Applause)
We shall now proceed to the vote.
I wanted to say it publicly.
That is too much!
Nonetheless, Mr Posselt is right.
We need to discuss Thursday afternoon's agenda.
Otherwise we might as well spare ourselves the effort.
(Applause)
It simply is not necessary with the new Rules.
(Protests from Mr Posselt)
And just what has been decided?
Today would have been a perfect opportunity.
They can spend hours in their constituencies.
(Applause)
We have saved time.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Tribute
I ask you to observe one minute's silence.
(Applause)
However, further efforts are needed.
Their achievements are extraordinary.
This proves that the markets have confidence.
This programme is starting to bear fruit.
And to economic growth.
Enlargement is not just about economics, however.
It is important primarily for political and ethical reasons.
This is the task of the Convention.
Let me explain this in a little more detail.
(Applause)
It is their own decision.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Why did you do this without us?'
(Applause)
This is a gratifying development that must be maintained.
(Applause)
(Applause from the right)
We must never forget this!
Without Poland, this would not have been possible.
Is there discrimination here?
(Applause)
(Applause)
Today is an historic occasion.
Enlargement is first and foremost a security issue.
Some say enlargement is too costly.
But politics is not like that.
We do not sit around waiting for perfection.
We have a window of opportunity to enlarge.
Enlargement and reform go side-by-side.
Today is not the end of a process.
We must scrutinise the path forward very closely.
Thank you Elvis!
One thing is clear, however.
This is in itself good news.
And there is the rub.
Quite the opposite.
I think that this is a mistake.
You achieve a signature now and ill feeling later.
That is not the solution.
We need to talk about this.
This is the problem of funding for enlargement.
How can that work?
Let us come now to enlargement.
Clearly, they need to reform.
Let us call a spade a spade.
That is why we are unable to progress.
That is the lesson to be learned.
Lastly, this should have been clearly stated.
Total social harmonisation.
Is that our dream?
(Applause)
We would welcome that.
(Applause)
Of course not.
Enlargement will continue.
This outcome was negotiated on the spot in Nice.
My group has different attitudes to enlargement.
Transposing Community law into national law is not enough.
This is a reason to rejoice.
Quite the reverse.
Moreover, there are still flaws in the system.
We should not arouse false expectations.
The principle is there.
Europe means talking to each other!
I am disappointed by the Commission's stance.
I have spoken of rifts.
Enlargement is the political expression of reconciliation in Europe.
That is our great opportunity.
This enthusiasm is still among us in copious amounts.
This is transgressing the rules of decency.
This article applies to us all.
Since the phrase 'Bene?
The Commission's proposals are a starting point.
What does the Commission's proposal mean?
Credit where credit is due.
He has conducted campaigns against all the treaties.
He was opposed to Danish membership of the EC.
My apologies.
This satisfaction is, however, tinged with regret.
Welcome to a disciplinary Europe!
I emphasised that the EU's position is clear.
So much has been said.
That seems to me to be a welcome advance.
What are Saddam Hussein's genocidal acts?
That is genocide.
His goal was to change the regime in Baghdad.
He had put forward a theory of pre-emptive war.
Nobody is fooled.
They are ready to start work again immediately.
This much is clear.
Then let us make a start!
How are we to prevent this?
The second question concerns the UN Security Council.
What would be your answers to these questions?
That dossier makes for some interesting reading.
Superimposed on this was a footprint of Buckingham Palace.
This must not be unilateral action.
It is not enough to threaten.
We must keep the pressure on Saddam Hussein.
It is not too late to prevent this war.
Mr President, two minutes, six points.
He clearly intends to continue.
We are not considering what this could lead to.
Mr President, Europe already has a Military Staff.
We are preparing a rapid-reaction force.
We are not pacifists.
The Iraqi Government agreed to this.
He maintains this condition.
Beware!
It would encourage a surge in Islamic fundamentalism.
President Bush cannot, of course, admit this.
I also want to talk about the United Nations.
I agree it is a step towards legitimacy.
We must keep the compass firmly at north.
This battle is still taking place here in Europe.
Al Qaida sleeper networks still remain in 52 countries.
Europe has always backed the United Nations Security Council.
And just what does that mean?
They too must take their share of the blame.
Is this the legal system the conservatives stand for?
The justice of the powerful and international lawlessness?
What would happen then?
Obviously, this also applies to Israel.
He has other priorities.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
The resolution was most valuable to the Council.
The third point concerns the governance of the process.
I should also like to mention two horizontal issues.
Last year 4 600 employment regulations were introduced.
That is one every 26 minutes.
That is hardly the way ahead.
Thirdly, prospects for financial instruments.
They are therefore a key political priority.
These need to be eliminated.
We must look at the figures.
This needs to be investigated.
I hope Parliament will support the report.
Will this produce any extra benefits?
This is my second question.
We often do much better than we think.
I also share the view as regards focus.
These issues are important.
We must have proper democratic control.
All of this is important.
I therefore welcome this proposal.
I should, however, like a clarification.
That is a practical question.
We are discussing the revision of the employment strategy.
How can we sum this up?
Here are a few considerations.
I have two observations to make in this connection.
My final point concerns Mr Bushill-Matthews' report.
Finally, a few words on higher education.
We need to go further, however.
People must get off passive welfare and into work.
That is, and remains, the main task.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is a joint debate on:
?
On this, I ask for your support!
Algeria also needs Europe.
The second point concerns the free movement of persons.
This is a reasonable request on the Algerian side.
That is the most important thing.
The country also has a terrorism problem.
The Liberal Group would vote against the resolution.
The association agreement is important for Algeria.
Europe therefore has a responsibility.
Consequently, it is what it is.
This has to be said!
Paramilitary groups.
This has to be written!
The case brought by Mr Nezzar was thrown out.
How can we accept this?
It must also be a political association.
(The President cut the speaker off)
What does this mean?
All your amendments are misguided.
Most of them have already been withdrawn?
Well then, withdraw the rest!
We will all be happy!'
Why?
They have the right to participate in European discussions.
That is not our role.
Algeria has a single party tradition.
Let us adopt this resolution.
This work must have support.
Hostility towards foreigners is also becoming increasingly widespread.
This was very much an internal power struggle.
There is always a vying between these two groups.
They discussed the situation in the CÃ´te d'Ivoire.
Written into that new agreement was a peer review.
We are also surprised by it too, however.
France has the courage to do this.
This is the core of the problem.
Thank you, Commissioner.
They claimed numerous lives and inflicted massive physical damage.
I think we should proceed as swiftly as possible.
We have therefore put the emphasis on three things.
This needs to be remedied.
Our group is in favour of establishing the fund.
This is unmistakeably and tangibly symbolic of European solidarity.
In summer 2002, however, everything changed.
We are building a Europe of solidarity.
How are we to avoid wasting it?
I invite you to reflect on the matter.
We should not be deceiving ourselves.
Mr Savary mentioned this earlier.
I do not accept these compliments for myself alone.
I certainly hope so.
We will then assess what needs to be done.
Perhaps we should discuss this issue further.
It is sometimes regional.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
I congratulate him again on reaching a useful conclusion.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Where does that get us?
That is surely a credibility issue!
The prevention of fraud is nothing new.
I think it right to be sceptical about that.
Is that the big picture?
Is that not the method that promises success?
It seems to have learned nothing from it.
This is something to which the Commission must respond.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
These nets should be banned.
We cannot allow such unsustainable practices to continue unchecked.
So I hope that Parliament will endorse these measures.
The ELDR has tabled three amendments of its own.
I am therefore unwilling to accept it.
I can agree to Amendment No 10.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.42 p.m.)
Greenhouse gas emission allowance trading
Thank you, Mrs Hautala.
This should be taken care of.
Three aspects were paramount in our group.
Thirdly, the scheme must be effective.
We as Socialists take employment seriously.
Let us do so, therefore, with conviction.
I commend the Commission for its draft directive.
We have a lot to learn.
It will not be easy.
We appreciate this very much.
After all, this is a very complicated subject.
We in this Parliament have embraced Kyoto.
Only four MEPs voted against.
My group is in favour of an auction system.
Is emissions trading therefore pie in the sky?
I do not think so.
Quite the reverse.
This complicates the directive unnecessarily.
Emissions trading can be a means to this end.
The initial allocation must definitely be free of charge.
In other words the total allowance will be small.
These emission allowances must lapse.
It is my conviction that everyone should take part.
This is why we need an effective scheme.
With this instrument a market is to be created.
The Kyoto principle is simple.
My first comment is that this system is ingenious.
We have three commitments to take into account.
We must ensure that climate change is reduced.
The system must obviously be mandatory.
We cannot invent something new.
We all agree about what our aim should be.
The Kyoto commitments must be fulfilled.
Thousands of jobs in industry are involved.
I will return to this subject in a moment.
They are measures that still need to be addressed.
Every journey begins with a first step.
So much for my introductory remarks.
In Kyoto, the Member States committed themselves.
The Kyoto Protocol commits the Member States.
You want to impose obligations on businesses.
The Kyoto Protocol is effective from 2008 to 2012.
Your mandatory emissions trading begins as early as 2005.
That is a massive amount.
I want to make the following points.
That is why it makes sense.
I would rather that they did not.
My Amendment No 37 is particularly important.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The latter the committee fortunately accepted in my proposal.
We govern, after all, by consent.
It must be flexible and market based.
I hope the Commission can accept both those amendments.
The trade in emissions rights is one such instrument.
It is necessary to remember this.
The debate is closed.
You are very welcome.
I will therefore confirm our position.
It would introduce harmonised rules throughout the Community.
It should in fact be the other way round.
We cannot wait any longer.
We must push this report through.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
The next item is the vote.
Is that correct?
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a special case.
.
I really regret this decision.
Unfortunately, not all of them were accepted.
Hence our abstention from the vote.
Let things stay that way.
.
It is unnecessary to prepare more communications.
Why not use this directive?
Why not use the existing legislation?
Why, therefore, has nothing happened?
How can that be the case?
The Commission owes us a very good explanation.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
Resumption of the session
Tuesday
That starts the week on a good note.
Do we have a speaker against this request?
We therefore suggest postponing this debate until Thursday afternoon.
What I have to say is simple.
What were we meant to do in the circumstances?
(Applause)
New and better rules are not enough, however.
(Applause)
I want to make this point even clearer.
(Applause)
It is a success for us all!
Today is one of them.
(Applause)
This is the current situation.
It is as follows.
France must therefore face an early warning.
Let us be clear.
(Applause from the left)
Let us stop being so hypocritical!
We could have laughed about it together.
Let us continue!
(Applause)
Economic development and social progress are not their concern.
Unambiguous sanctions are also required.
Mr President, one of the following is true.
Demolish it, and you imperil monetary union.
We have one - the Commission!
How long the Commission has taken to admit this!
I await your replies.
How is growth achieved?
That is a view that I share.
They are wrong!
Wrong!
This should not be what the discussion is about.
What should it be about?
No, indeed not.
This is no surprise.
Economic boom periods do not last forever.
Booms are followed by recession.
That is the problem we are facing.
Parliament has made its suggestions.
Such an elegant provocation ...
(Interruption)
(Applause)
I am sure you will agree with me.
I am sure that we all agree on this.
Let us change the Stability and Growth Pact.
A currency is as strong as its economy.
This must be changed.
(Applause)
This is a clever move in the short term.
This is unacceptable.
Time is pressing.
I still have no reply.
She was the winner of the Miss Denmark contest.
rapporteur.
I commend the report to Parliament.
No human work is perfect.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
So let us incorporate it.
The question is knowing how to incorporate it.
I shall end with two brief comments.
The vision is clear enough.
The Charter is important.
I support the Charter.
I have always thought it was a good Charter.
Any such attempt must meet with resistance from us.
Unfortunately, however, this is not true.
This is something we should condemn.
This is not the case.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This, however, cannot be believed.
Sterling work was done at the time.
This is the first point I wanted to make.
They must also become binding.
I shall content myself with making two points.
We cannot forget this.
I heartily congratulate both of them!
Recital V shows that this is already happening.
Paragraph 2 also concerns me.
This is another indication of the potential for confusion.
The Charter carries great authority and legitimacy.
What it lacks is clarity and legal certainty.
The debate is closed.
Statement in writing (Rule 120)
That is a familiar argument in this House.
Thank you, Mr President.
Why?
Let me turn now to the report.
That, though, is quite nonsensical.
Your proposals have a damaging effect on European integration.
That was the point of departure.
I have one point of criticism.
I will therefore not be endorsing these proposals.
That is not all, however.
How many refugees, by the way?
We do not know.
The text gives no evaluation.
What will be the financial burden for the taxpayer?
It is a mystery.
We do not know.
No evaluation is proposed for this either.
This is not a responsible course of action.
What are these differences?
We want the Geneva Convention retained.
We want the nuclear family.
This is essential.
This, at least, is our view.
It is a situation that needs a sympathetic response.
We will support this report.
We should be compassionate in our reports.
Let us be quite clear about this.
This is known as 'streamlining procedures'.
This is an issue which I believe is relevant.
This is true.
The debate is closed.
We are concerned here with cross-border crime.
The Commission's proposal is a good one.
We are also concerned here with intent.
I think that this is a proper approach.
The current system causes democratic rights to be neglected.
Human rights lie outside the jurisdiction of the Court.
Viruses can have unforeseen consequences for those using computers.
People want to protect their privacy from intruders.
The debate is closed.
That was the first thing that they said.
Member States must also make an effort to cooperate.
Next, the lack of statistics.
It takes a great deal of time.
This is certainly one of our great concerns.
I would like to speak briefly about fiscal issues.
Another aspect is training.
Cultural cooperation is an element of enlargement.
I very much support that.
It lives!
Europe must help where it can.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your observations.
(The President cut the speaker off)
You do not have any time left.
Patronage and sponsorship are important.
That is why we should do more about this.
It was a misunderstanding.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.50 p.m.)
Medicinal products
Commissioner Liikanen has the floor.
.
Let me start with the objectives of the proposals.
There are three.
Why?
The mutual recognition procedure has shown its limits.
Let us take the example of biotechnology.
Experience has not brought any major problems to light.
Why is this so important?
How then are these needs to be balanced?
How will this happen?
This will provide a harmonised solution for Europe.
The Commission believes that this is a balanced proposal.
It is a prudent proposal.
We cannot change this situation by our legislation.
This is a challenging piece of legislation.
The procedure must be transparent.
A medicinal product is a product unlike any other.
Some Members wanted to question the principle.
You will choose between either health or the market.
We all know that innovation comes at a price.
They illustrate the success of our European health systems.
This unmitigated rejection poses a problem, however.
I am referring to package leaflets.
This is a very positive point.
I want to draw attention to just three points.
One is the authorisation procedure.
This applies particularly to veterinary medicines.
That is almost beyond our control.
I hope that Parliament will look at it sensibly.
.
I would like to raise three issues.
Mrs Read briefly covered one.
I hope this House will consider supporting it.
The real worry is not particularly with food-chain animals.
Therefore, it is important that we have flexibility.
I hope the Commission will also follow my opinion.
This is a hard balance to strike.
This is not what we want for European citizens.
We could certainly have gone a little further.
This report highlights some considerable challenges.
This measure can only motivate European research and innovation.
This is surely a lesson for the Commission.
Finally, I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs.
I therefore commend Amendment No 43 to the House.
That is a safety precaution we should retain.
I see this as important.
Does a medicine have value-added?
The pharmaceutical industry is decidedly against this.
Many medicines are toxic substances.
Is that because the Directorate-General of Industry is responsible?
I should also like to comment on pricing policy.
We should put a stop to this.
Finally, I am not in favour of advertising.
Spending on medicines is increasing in most Member States.
The development of medicines is not going well either.
This is unacceptable.
Why is this?
(Applause from the right)
These brief comments are not unnecessary.
I regard homeopathic medicines in the same way.
We must get the balance right.
They have been a great help to many patients.
Much has happened since then.
This is an excessively bureaucratic burden.
Medicinal products need to be used appropriately and correctly.
The same applies to Irish cattle.
We must be consistent here.
We have made mistakes here before.
Please be careful.
We need rules that are appropriate for SMEs.
Think about that.
Have I really voted to provide better health protection?
A number of interesting issues have been raised.
I will comment on six groups of amendments.
Mrs GrossetÃªte put the whole case very well.
That is a very sensitive issue.
I would be happy to discuss that in depth.
We are not proposing that.
It is clearly better for the consumer.
It is extremely important that we stick to that.
I just do not believe it.
The balance is not always easy.
We have done this after very careful consideration.
To keep the balance, we cannot support it.
This could increase the availability of over-the-counter medicines.
That is why we cannot support Amendment No 40.
The third issue concerns improving information for patients.
A pilot project does not mean direct advertising.
That is not what we are proposing.
The fourth issue concerns relative effectiveness.
Some amendments relate to relative effectiveness.
The fifth group of amendments concerns legal status.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
First, the legal base.
Secondly, trade.
We have therefore tabled amendments deleting the maximum number.
Thirdly, identification.
This would help combat trafficking in pet animals.
The fourth point relates to young animals.
The fifth point concerns the involvement of Parliament.
Finally, the OIE International Animal Health Code.
This has been a subject of some debate.
I will begin with the nine technical amendments.
Let me now turn to the seven institutional amendments.
I cannot therefore accept Amendment No 12.
Nor can I accept the other four amendments.
I cannot accept those arguments.
I do not believe this is a persuasive argument.
I have provided you with the witness report.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Codecision procedures are underway.
We are awaiting the Council's response.
Thank you for coming to visit Parliament.
President.
Voting time is now suspended.
It will be resumed after the formal sitting.
The Fiori Report has not received my support.
I have abstained for two reasons.
It is, after all, a petroleum product.
The positive effects flowing from this are self-evident.
It makes you wonder ...
The suspense is excruciating.
Immigration is an asset.
.
The deadlines set under various articles are too short.
.
Hence our vote against the report.
I therefore support the proposal to postpone this section.
.
What did I see in this play?
.
.
That has nothing to do with this House.
.
That concludes voting time.
Section III - Commission
Section I - European Parliament
Section II - Council
Section IV - Court of Justice
Section V - Court of Auditors
Section VI - Economic and Social Committee
Section VII - Committee of the Regions
Section VIII (A) - European Ombudsman
Section VIII (B) - European Data Protection Supervisor
Despite these improvements I am still not satisfied.
This is becoming a serious problem.
This is completely preposterous.
Heading 2: the Structural Funds.
I have already mentioned the problem with implementation.
It will be a 'memorandum item'.
Here information is a necessary lubricant.
Here we have taken a more restrictive line.
The Council and the Commission propose major new initiatives.
This has concerned the Balkans and Serbia.
I think this is absurd.
The budget ceiling is simply too low.
We have resolved them in broad agreement.
The main and obvious priority was enlargement.
The second priority was implementing necessary reforms.
We will now postpone this by one year.
This is an excellent feeling.
It is a joint undertaking.
But that requires staff too, of course.
So thank you for your support.
I would like to express a personal view.
These are questions which all our group supports.
That is a request that we have made.
0.3% for Germany!
We try to ensure that balances are maintained.
These are long-term tasks.
Money needs to be earmarked for that.
It is hard to do all this.
These are objectives our group wholeheartedly supports.
The undoubted focus of the budget is enlargement.
This particularly concerns the Structural Funds and external actions.
Well done, Sweden!
The Swedish rapporteurs have done an excellent job.
Take agricultural policy, for example.
Which is right, of course.
We are a political forum, after all.
I hope that Parliament will support me in this.
It concerns the funding for Kedo.
We touched upon this briefly last night.
One such example is enlargement.
The financial plan should therefore be adjusted accordingly.
The situation in category four has also changed.
What programmes will we be offering then?
This worked out well.
That too is a fine thing!
This strikes us as highly improbable.
This could be the thin end of the wedge.
Active financial support is undesirable and superfluous.
My third and final comment concerns fisheries.
This has caused unfair competition for many years.
Europe needs new impetus.
I voted for them and campaigned for them.
You are the Community's executive.
I am one of those who voted for it.
They have respected Parliament and Parliament's will.
The Danish presidency has been good to work with.
This is part of our tradition.
I will focus on just two technical aspects.
I would add something further.
I will mention one more issue: culture.
More work therefore needs to be done on them.
How much will enlargement cost?
That is the question.
We have now met both.
The Community is called on to act here.
Madam President, I will do what I can.
First point.
But only for institutional posts.
This situation must change.
For example, the bargain or British cheque.
This budget is not only catastrophic, however.
It is also nostalgic.
I would therefore like to focus on two points.
I have being fighting this fight for many years.
Rigour is the watchword.
On average each company employs five people.
However, we want to do even more.
What are my general comments on the budget?
We should thus remain committed to the financial perspectives.
This is particularly the case in category 4.
However, a number of things are already clear.
My committee was mainly concerned with four areas.
The first was OLAF, Europe's anti-fraud office.
This is crucial for enlargement too.
Employment depends on it.
These appropriations cannot be refused year upon year.
This is, I believe, a historic act.
I see a further problem.
We are losing revenue.
I believe that is of tremendous importance.
We should do something about this.
This is the way it is.
Unfortunately, my news is not good news.
They concern firstly cooperation with third countries on migration.
Secondly, they concern the European Refugee Fund.
The third point is the Celex budget.
These forecasts were dismissed.
These amendments, Commissioner, pertained to three areas.
I welcome this and thank the Committee on Budgets.
This is the first area that has been adopted.
A second area is about women and decision-making.
The standards are very high at the moment.
Thank you for this contribution.
This work has clearly produced results this time.
The debate is closed.
Subject: Food crisis in the Tindouf refugee camps
This is the good news.
There is some donor fatigue.
This is the background.
I agree with the question in this respect.
I have just one supplementary remark.
That makes the dialogue with Parliament meaningful and useful.
These are most serious allegations.
They have been carefully examined by the Commission.
This constitutes 10% of their overall budget.
I hope some Members will reflect on that sentence.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner the following questions:
Who would not be?
What on earth does he think I will say?
Who will expect us to do that?
Subject: Russian Federation - expulsion of Catholic priests
So this is an issue of general concern.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Schreyer
What is the number of licences currently in use?
How are those licences actually used?
If not, why not?
Pre-accession aid is also managed using this system.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Questions to Commissioner Vitorino
What steps can be taken to prevent it?
Subject: Combating paedophilia
The DAPHNE programme also specifically refers to paedophilia.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your explanation.
Subject: Designation of terrorists as 'political prisoners'
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Questions to Commissioner Byrne
Subject: Livestock markets
Subject: Food safety
This project is nearly finished.
Subject: Diabetes
Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle disease.
I have high hopes for that programme.
I just want to clarify that.
Subject: Salmonella and meat preparations
Subject: Salmonella in marinated meat
Chicken products were the worst offenders.
That is the main problem.
This issue will be discussed on that occasion.
That is the overriding consideration.
I have two answers to that question.
That is fundamental as far as I am concerned.
Unemployment did not increase as a result.
There was a shift in other directions.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Enlargement symbolises for me the day ahead of us.
(Applause)
Why uncharted territory?
Of course this paper is not perfect.
What is all this about?
We certainly need to be a little wary here.
We liberals always push for maximum transparency.
Naturally, certain documents cannot be made public.
Such documents must be kept confidential.
We also realise this.
The Commissioners must be accountable to the public.
That is the sad fact.
Only those parliaments can hold ministers to account.
This also has wider implications.
Thank you for your comment, Mrs Hautala.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The task in hand is clear indeed.
(Interjection by Mr Bourlanges)
Perhaps Mr Bourlanges will hear it as well.
It is currently a political event.
The procedure should not be too complicated.
Each member should be able to understand it.
Commission.
A good and clear result has finally been achieved.
End of quotation from Article 146.
This deferment procedure also involves three other difficulties.
We were at an impasse.
Mr Martin, I wish you good luck.
That is what started the whole process.
That means that there are now three options.
That is a slightly different interpretation.
That is what has happened in the past.
That is why this system is much better.
Parliament cannot therefore grant discharge without justification.
This is a good thing.
One problem is refusal to grant discharge.
The rapporteur and I also had some good discussions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
First, the lack of an action plan.
Today, that number is down to around 24.
The main points in this communication are as follows.
We have launched the first stage of consultation.
Again, we can be more definite.
The analysis is under way.
Finally, I shall comment on simplification and codification.
I support the report.
A genuine joint action.
I hope that we can make progress.
We need an action plan covering the working environment.
Take the example of the vibrations directive.
This brings the European Union into disrepute.
The text is very clear.
This is in fact a dispute.
The cutbacks have to be made somewhere.
Health and safety cost money.
That is the reality of the situation.
Increased expert assistance might be considered.
I particularly endorse Mr Hughes' report.
I very much agree with all of that.
I agree.
I agree with that too.
This is nonsense.
We will hope together for progress.
We do not need more directives.
In actual fact, they are in decline.
There is the problem and there is the challenge.
This started way back with the industrial revolution.
And it is not over yet.
The Commission has it very nearly right.
Mr Hughes' report goes far too far.
Attention has been drawn to the human resources cutbacks.
But we have the Bilbao Agency.
So there is very close cooperation.
Now some specific comments.
It is not just legislation.
Reference was made to quality.
Then we have to work on concrete indicators.
Benchmarking has been referred to.
I spoke about that earlier.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
All workers deserve protection.
That is something we need to address.
I know the Commission has difficulty with that.
They will be predominantly self-employed.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez.
Thank you for this sound report.
The topic is labour relations.
The Commission has opted for a recommendation.
This inspection is often inadequate, however.
That is clearly ridiculous.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The Commission favours such a tightening-up of the procedures.
The Commission will take this on board as well.
I am not going to go into that.
Why do I lay such emphasis on this?
My sincerest thanks go to him accordingly.
The system has to be clear and transparent.
We have proposed an amendment in this vein.
This explains our second amendment.
We will simply have to wait and see.
Applications from outside will not be possible.
The draft has nothing to say about this.
It was far more a matter of culture.
I ask you!
That, Commissioner, is just not acceptable!
Perhaps you are putting the cart before the horse.
Commission.
Let me first put something straight.
This separation of the functions is important.
It does not prevent posts being externally advertised.
Why is that the case?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Let me start with the latter.
I now wish to say a little about enlargement.
The Commission submitted its communication on 18 September.
This is not something we are accustomed to.
I congratulate the Irish people on their decision.
It demonstrates their openness and sense of responsibility.
The forthcoming European Council in Brussels is therefore crucial.
The agenda will include the issue of Kaliningrad too.
It will work for the future Member States too.
There is nothing negative in that.
It is now time to address the remaining problems.
These last remaining issues are nonetheless highly significant.
On this I ask for your support.
The remainder is neither for nor against.
This is a very important point.
The Schengen criteria must also be adhered to.
There are other problems with borders.
That is very important.
This is also an extremely important signal.
The decisions that remain will not be easy.
I believe that more should have been done.
This is unacceptable.
Naturally, the candidate countries also have a choice.
Why is this so?
That is not the solidarity that the EU needs.
Let me say something about agricultural policy.
President Prodi referred to a lack of public approval.
And why is that so?
I support what Mr Poettering said.
That would be a recipe for disaster.
Ireland is the most EU-friendly country there is.
It voted 'no'.
This was presented at a closed meeting last Thursday.
Vote 'yes' or disappear.
The EU state comes before the voters.
No, thank you, Mr President.
They are emerging from the nightmare of Communism.
Let us add solidarity to this list.
We must not, however, confuse the matter.
President Chirac is mistaken.
Comparing the two policies is a serious mistake.
This is, frankly speaking, go-it-alone irresponsibility.
Why do they do nothing?
This does not make pleasant reading.
Anything else would have been unreasonable.
First, Kaliningrad.
Secondly, the widely discussed issue of the budget.
I now have a question for Mr Haarder.
The Netherlands has always been a pro-European country.
This removed a serious obstacle to enlargement.
I sense that the remaining problems are clear.
No new conditions for enlargement should be imposed.
I think that they are entitled to an answer.
Will horizontal enlargement not obstruct vertical enlargement?
Will this be intergovernmentalism's final victory?
Allow me a final comment.
This would appear to be a great achievement.
This really has now come to nought.
Last Monday I was in Bratislava, in Slovakia.
Other countries have also been named.
The historical and moral reunification of Europe is irrevocable.
The EU honours its agreements.
We stand our ground.
Are there such plans in the pipeline?
Your point is worth emphasising.
The information campaign is not only about public relations.
It must have political conviction behind it.
There is still room for improvement in this respect.
This is one problem.
They should not be allowed to overshadow the opportunities.
It is a question of a better environment.
All of this is our responsibility.
A brief word about Kaliningrad.
Time must be found for that later on.
All this also applies to Slovakia.
I am, however, concerned about another matter.
The people must also be involved.
Cyprus is another issue altogether.
I am indebted to him for this.
My final comment is about Turkey.
No new conditions for enlargement should be imposed.
No new conditions.
This is something that must be solved in stages.
It is not an insurmountable obstacle, however.
The Irish referendum taught us one important lesson.
Now we are almost there.
We are approaching our destination.
We are getting there.
Difficulties and problems will arise.
Mr President, being Dutch sometimes has its drawbacks.
Finally, a word on Turkey.
These problems cannot simply be brushed aside.
This was echoed by Mr Lund and Mr Andersson.
For that I thank the Irish voters.
That is not asking much.
In that case, we can forget it.
(Applause)
Let me end with a brief comment on Kaliningrad.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner.
The sitting is now suspended until voting time.
(Mixed reactions)
(Laughter and applause)
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
The Bureau tabled a proposal for decision to plenary.
It is indicated in today's voting list.
(Parliament adopted the decision)
(Parliament adopted the decision)
Before the vote:
We are therefore abstaining on this report.
.
.
.
.
The British Conservatives support this.
The British Conservatives are therefore against this report.
This proposal has our full support.
.
.
.
Their information deficit would increase.
.
.
.
.
(NL) Medicines are commodities that earn money.
Patients require reliable information from an independent source.
Flexibility must therefore be maintained.
Mr President, I welcome Mr Duff's report.
Our fears are being confirmed.
.
Examples of this are:
.
.
Which will take precedence?
I cannot, therefore, support the draft.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
We shall not be moved on this.
The EU did not stop at words.
The list of results makes impressive reading.
Where do we draw the line?
I believe that we have struck the right balance.
And I say 'must' advisedly.
Nor are the poor more wicked than anyone else.
Our action in Afghanistan is a case in point.
We face a different problem today.
We have a real paradox here.
This does not happen under Rule 37.
Rest assured, this is something I regret.
You said that the authors come first.
The authors are the two appointed by the committees.
That is the normal procedure with amendments.
Both the authors are sitting here.
Perhaps a mistake has been made!
This is what I propose, ladies and gentlemen.
Where have we failed?
I sincerely doubt it.
I am going to highlight three fundamental aspects.
Thank you, Mr President.
There can be no tolerance of the intolerant.
I have also re-read the debate on Galileo.
This is not enough.
In addition, the resolution causes confusion.
Who could be opposed to this?
I am really waiting for a reply.
They are all equally despicable.
Our grassroots support needs this.
Are we really managing to drive back terrorist networks?
This role is crucial.
Terrorism is not a new phenomenon in itself.
Democracy is the best antidote to terrorism.
This is essentially what the far-right trades on.
Anybody at all.
Let us not dwell on that, however.
This goes to show that nothing is simple.
This is true in this report too.
The causes of terrorism are often sought in poverty.
I do not actually believe that this is so.
This is also the case here.
A considerable leap is required to resort to violence.
We were all shocked by the attacks on Bali.
All are very necessary.
What more can one add?
We must stand firm on this.
But this is not the case!
Does this unilateralism spell the demise of the alliance?
Madam President, terrorism is unacceptable.
We are all agreed on that.
This applies to smaller states in particular.
Undermining the UN can only end in disaster.
Our internal strategy has in any case been successful.
What we need now is a successful external strategy.
How has the EU reacted to this tragic event?
Mr President, nothing justifies the use of terrorism.
This aspect is not well understood.
Now we have IRA terrorists in government.
The message of recent years is that terrorism works.
That is a fatal message.
Deterrence does not necessarily work.
This is what is required.
We do not need a general opinion.
They are fully integrated into our common legal framework.
We also need to mobilise military and other resources.
We need exchanges of intelligence at European level.
It requires extra efforts.
Secondly, multilateral action.
The United Nations is the first stage.
Thank you, Commissioner.
My approach will be a different one.
The world changed.
Full security will never be achievable.
Security has therefore become a major policy concern.
Let me turn now to data protection.
Action to improve the situation is ongoing.
But enhanced cooperation is also needed globally.
Mrs Flesch, your comment will be noted.
The work was also widely praised.
You said that you had adopted a decision.
That was clear from what you said.
I urge you to act on them!
We also proposed specific measures.
Who actually protects our citizens against the authorities?
People still do not feel adequately protected.
Since then, we have not expressed an opinion.
Allow me to make a preliminary remark.
There were two reactions to this.
Both reactions are wrong!
The Commission is doing too little here.
This is to be welcomed.
There are 70 measures.
That means I would have 20 seconds for each.
This applies to both paragraphs 27 and 28.
Paragraph 29 concerns research work on encryption technology.
We have just given instructions to our committees.
Open-source encryption software is a higher priority in FP6.
It was a great success.
I have one comment to make on open-source.
Paragraph 31 concerns standardisation.
You said that nothing has been done.
You are wrong.
The sensitivity of the data called for special solutions.
That will be a major priority.
We are working in an extremely difficult field.
Thank you, Commissioner.
My question is what is the Commission itself doing?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall hear questions to the Council.
Mr President, this is a point of order.
In my opinion this is absolutely disgraceful.
This kind of behaviour should not take place.
Mr Galeote Quecedo, you have the floor.
There has been talk of first- and second-class citizens.
More than that I am unable to say.
The rules of procedure are quite clear.
I most definitely cannot blame them for doing so.
That code is not binding.
Subject: International Criminal Court
For this reason he rejects the Council's attitude.
Subject: International Criminal Court
It was a position supported by the candidate countries.
No way.
The EU cannot monitor the whole world.
How would you define it?
I heard the minister refer to a common position.
Subject: New opportunities as regards relations with Libya
The Council has not discussed Colonel Gadaffi's speeches.
What would be the likely timetable for action?
Subject: Neighbouring country status for Ukraine
What does this status entail in practical terms?
The EU recognises Ukraine's European aspirations.
Subject: The EU and Macedonia
It is a delicate issue, I admit.
Subject: Human rights
That is something quite different.
That is an expression I should like to repudiate.
The first is the definitions.
The second point concerns tour operators.
They dominate our working lives.
No frills should not mean no concern.
Every day further horrors come to light.
Virtually all the European airlines were party to it.
The economic argument is even more persuasive.
My objections are based on the following reasons.
They could probably then cover themselves against flight cancellations.
This applies to both denied boarding and cancellation.
What company is still customer-friendly in such circumstances?
The proposal has a clear two-pronged approach.
It is as simple as that.
It is completely irrelevant how much the ticket cost.
Their confidence has been damaged, and more besides.
I therefore believe that our proposal is quite sensible.
We fear that this wording is very vague.
This is unacceptable!
There is no future in that.
Often it is even very unpleasant.
Passengers will thank us for it.
Thank you very much, Madam Vice-President.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
.
The EU is the largest donor in the world.
There must be a lesson here.
They do not want our fish.
I hope that the House will accept this report.
Technically that cannot be called dumping.
These positive efforts should be recognised.
That certainly is a call to action.
They often have great potential in this area.
We should set honest prices.
Why?
I constantly ask myself what Europe is doing wrong.
That will help our forthcoming discussions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (Rule 120)
These criteria also include the precautionary principle.
This is the case now.
I am talking specifically about African elephants.
That will not help any elephant.
Destruction goes against every notion of sustained use.
Five countries in southern Africa have presented alternative plans.
We ought to take their arguments seriously at least.
I would also like to speak about the elephants.
That would be very wrong.
This has proved disastrous.
The Commission must abandon its cowardly, half-hearted position.
She said that they loved their elephants.
The Community is a contracting party to this Convention.
Opinions are divided.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The decision on ratification hardly needs further elaboration.
.
The report concentrates mainly on the following three points:
I am referring particularly to pesticides and biocides.
This means codecision for the European Parliament.
The talks on this area were most satisfactory.
The voting slip comprises 4 blocks.
Block 1 covers the compromise amendments with the Council.
We need this measure without delay.
I am extremely pleased with the proposal, therefore.
It is about protecting human health and the environment.
Most relate to the draft implementing regulation.
The Commission can therefore accept Amendments 11 and 18.
The Commission can accept all these amendments.
I now turn to the draft ratification decision.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The programme has much to offer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Welcome
Mr Speaker, we welcome you!
Further meetings are scheduled for today.
(Applause)
At first reading, Parliament adopted 77 amendments.
This is clearly a success for Parliament.
Many financial analysts have been both judge and accused.
The sums in question sometimes defy belief.
This is a very complex and sensitive issue.
The directive aims to do just that.
The directive does not do that.
The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments 6 and 7.
Congratulations, Mr Mann!
Warm congratulations to both Members!
(Applause)
This makes clear rules and confidence-building measures necessary.
We have come to agree on important matters.
Commissioner, on that you have my forthright support.
I would like to congratulate him.
The controversial question is different.
That is not what the directive says.
Our whole economic system is based on trust.
CESR does not have the expertise to regulate journalists.
It is vital that we respect those constitutional issues.
This is a test case.
The integrity of European markets has to be safeguarded.
Free speech is one of the cornerstones of democracy.
This would be impractical, unnecessary and disproportionate.
This is especially important for small retail investors.
I see it as being founded on seven points.
A lot has happened in the meantime.
That is the basis of our political work.
(Applause)
This situation, though, is rather different.
I am in favour of these interests being disclosed.
(Applause)
Financial journalists are free to write whatever they wish.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Their concerns are also our concerns.
In certain circumstances they serve as excellent local solutions.
This report is about infrastructure, not energy production.
The network and production must be kept separate.
And he has succeeded admirably.
So thank you for involving us from the outset.
They make money!
There is no academic evidence for this.
Firstly, we must reduce market dominance.
We have enormous potential for this.
This should not be a Christmas gift shop.
Natural gas is also growing in importance.
They are in Russia.
These amendments supplement or clarify the Commission's text.
The next item is the vote.
It is only EUR 2.6 million.
That is just a little warning.
Then there are some technical corrections.
We also have a technical adjustment in heading 5.
We have new parameters for salaries in 2003.
I will quickly read the figures for the record.
We also have some technical corrections on agencies.
There is no enlargement cost in that case.
It should be replaced by the European Inter-University Centre.
We are above the ceiling of EUR 72 million.
I just wanted to warn everybody about this.
The second part of the vote concerns the nomenclature.
Thank you for those clarifications.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That will obviously ease the problems in 2003.
I shall make three other very brief points.
Once again, it has failed to do so.
.
We believe that the agricultural subsidies must be reduced.
That applies in particular to the tobacco subsidies.
.
.
.
This is indeed extremely gratifying.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
The ELDR Group supported the Lisi report.
.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work.
.
Hence our vote against the report.
.
(FR) Terrorism sows and inspires horror.
.
.
Lies, I suppose.
.
I want to ask three things.
Firstly, how important is the New Delhi Conference?
The Commissioner would say that it is very important.
We have heard conflicting rumours.
That is to establish the state of play.
Such events often trigger this kind of reaction.
You cannot afford to be lax in that area.
Political leadership on this issue is incredibly important.
What, then, will happen after 2012?
What shall we do?
What are the objectives?
I do not mean you.
What is the Commission's current view on this?
The European Union ratified the Protocol six months ago.
We have to clean up our own act.
That is all I have to say.
The parliaments rubberstamp them, they have no choice.
And so we should.
I have no wish to contradict that.
This is a fact and we must face it.
We should be thinking more along these lines.
How do the Commissioners feel about this?
How does the Commission feel about this idea?
It is difficult to talk to the Russians.
What about a WTO initiative?
Maybe that is a good idea.
What happens in the second commitment period?
So first things first.
There was one question on air traffic.
Finally, what about equal rights per world citizen?
Remember that.
We need to reduce emissions as a result.
Our main objective is to protect the environment.
I hope you understand my argument.
Perhaps this is something which requires further debate.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
We achieved this.
This is where the figures start to get confusing.
For some crops, the increase was particularly large.
That is some 0.03% of the worldwide area.
Closing our market completely is not a viable option.
Secondly, thresholds must be workable and enforceable.
That is correct.
She said that Parliament will be informed.
This too has been promised.
Mr President, this is a recurring institutional debate.
Should the codecision procedure or comitology be used?
So much for the procedure.
Now for a brief material comment.
The Commissioner said as much.
This is the cut-off point.
And another thing.
There are such things as natural events.
There will always be GMOs.
That is precisely what the Council is currently negotiating.
You said just now that contamination is unavoidable.
That is as incorrect as it is unacceptable!
That I quite understand.
That needs to be made perfectly clear here.
I say that for the benefit of the Greens.
But the opponents do not want proof.
They condone obstruction and destruction of these trials.
On thousands of jobs in the food processing industry?
Perhaps there is a connection.
All these factors along the production chain are involved.
This debate will certainly continue.
Thank you Commissioner.
That is specifically ruled out.
It is there, in print.
I should like to have clarification of this matter.
The debate is closed.
So why are we applying this double standard?
I find that totally unacceptable.
Any hand extended by Iran is therefore welcome.
Because internal pressure is increasing, so is repression.
People have been sentenced to be stoned to death.
Barbaric punishments are still being carried out.
Does Commissioner Kinnock agree with me on this?
The European Union cannot afford to isolate Iran.
The younger generation wants change and offers hope.
But there is no substitute for openness and democratisation.
How can they speak about progress!
All of these developments are important and very welcome.
The latest reports are frightening.
The death penalty is frequently applied.
A whole world turns in abhorrence upon Iran.
Let us think for a moment.
Not a moment before, however.
Communication and dialogue will help here.
We will continue to act upon those fundamentals.
Mr President, Commissioner, just one supplementary question.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The destructive work of the Maoist guerrillas continues unabated.
One passer-by was killed and nine others were injured.
The position of the PPE-DE is perfectly clear.
The Council should appoint a special representative for Nepal.
I hope the Commission shares this position.
This contravenes the European code of conduct itself.
Yesterday, another 25 were killed in various clashes.
It rightly presses for mediation and political consultation.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed immediately to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Resumption of the session
Twelve people lost their lives in this tragic accident.
This matter could be dealt with under this heading.
This is a disgrace to Europe.
What is our intention through these proposals?
Firstly, control is required of all countries.
Independent control authorities already exist.
I congratulate Finland on the speed of its action.
Thank you Commissioner.
We have many requests from the floor.
I congratulate you on the honesty of your statement.
What will the agreement in question look like?
I would like to make two points.
Thank you, Mr President.
These proposals are a response to that.
We are proposing the opposite.
That is the situation of the candidate countries.
That is the problem we have to resolve.
This measure would make EUR 2 000 million available.
This is a very complicated problem.
I have explained what our approach is.
This debate cannot therefore ignore public opinion.
However, Article 31 relates to radiation protection.
I have spoken with these experts.
I have two questions.
My second question has to do with the timetable.
How have the candidate countries received this proposal?
Legal basis: Article 31.
Why is the problem of safety being raised?
Precisely in order to prevent ionisation and radioactive contamination.
In other words, for reasons of radioprotection.
We must, however, keep a cool head.
Yet this is completely untrue.
But there are objective and unquestionable facts.
That is the objective reality.
All the rest is interpretation.
I am telling you that that is my intention.
You have mentioned renewable energy.
Then I presented a proposal on biofuels.
Quite the opposite.
I have thrown myself into it from the outset.
Third question: Le Monde.
(Applause)
The twentieth century was a catastrophe for Europe.
Two terrible world wars tore our Continent apart.
Enlargement is the key to the future of Europe.
We made a number of crucial decisions.
They will not be faced with a fait accompli.
The Presidency had three objectives for the Brussels Summit:
The EU's policy is clear.
Obviously, enlargement was the main topic in Brussels.
We also sent a clear signal to Turkey.
(Applause)
However, we succeeded in obtaining a result.
We made three crucial decisions.
Thirdly, the issue of budgetary compensation was settled.
What lies ahead of us in the coming weeks?
The answer is: hard work.
Hard work and enduring intense negotiations.
We are already in full swing.
(Applause)
There is no time to waste.
The reality of enlargement is taking form.
I am thinking of the Balkans.
Thank you.
This is an absurd situation.
(Applause)
(Interruptions)
I wish you much success in this.
(Applause)
Finally, it has been won.
Listen to what we are saying.
Try to resolve the problem by listening to us.
I believe it is fair to point this out.
We cannot.
What are elections for?
What are Parliaments for?
Why?
There are now ten.
Will he be out of a job?
Will he abandon the proposal?
Are we going to continue working?
The candidate countries are full participants in the Convention.
We are talking about our future.
And that must be respected and defended.
(Applause)
Secondly, the safety clauses.
Have they really been properly thought through?
Agricultural policy needs to be substantially reformed.
We must not underestimate the difficulties of this work.
The candidate countries must subsequently hold their referendums.
Enlargement has therefore come at a good time.
My party warmly welcomes this.
We could have encouraged greater pluralism.
This is pitiful, under any circumstances.
Particularly in terms of agriculture.
Unfortunately, many have already forgotten this.
Finally, a word on Chechnya.
In third place comes the issue of Turkey.
That was defeated at the summit.
I think that this is a good sign.
This is wonderful!
We shall take note of what has been achieved.
I have three further points to make.
Let us be vigilant towards Turkey therefore.
This Union must be an open and tolerant Union.
I ask the Commissioner, how will modulation work?
No doubt there are reasons for this.
What a credible policy!
That cannot be for real!
Fourthly, I ask you to consider the following.
I know that.
Yes, you in particular!
(Applause)
(Laughter, interruptions)
(Applause)
No, they do not.
An opportunity for early reform has been lost.
What signal does this send to our American allies?
Thank you, Mr President.
Turkey is a candidate country.
The issue of the safeguard clauses was also raised.
In fact, we have always had safeguard clauses.
I do not want to spend time on this.
We are giving priority to enlargement of the EU.
It is that simple.
The Danish Presidency will keep a watch on this.
This kind of consensus really is extremely rare.
We based our report on practical criteria.
We are pushing for urgent resolution of this matter.
That is clear.
The case is very similar to that of Ireland.
Could you confirm this for me?
I will comment on the objective.
It is precisely here that there are difficulties.
On both sides, innocent people are still dying.
(Applause)
(Applause)
That was more than twenty years ago!
We need to kick-start this issue.
That is right and it is true.
Both these things are true.
The Palestinians fear occupation by the Israeli army.
The two things are very closely related.
And then in Iraq, the truth is straightforward.
The same applies to Russia and Chechnya.
The risk should also be calculable.
Our joint effort must be tied up with this.
Given our position, this is wrong.
Terrorists follow no political agenda.
We have nothing to gain from this barbaric action.
The first European social summit begins tomorrow in Florence.
Mr President, the world must avoid war.
Not so much with words as with deeds.
The air attacks are unrelenting.
A massive raid was mounted against military interventions.
The war has already begun.
Unemployment is increasing.
What is it that we want?
Or pessimistic.
We do not need to make grand declarations.
We have already done that.
Their efforts must continue.
This is, therefore, an absolutely crucial element.
Secondly, payments must be made.
What did we want to see?
Three things.
These three things have been achieved.
And they will be returning.
Thank you very much, Mr Solana.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate
Mr Daul has the floor.
The debate was extremely comprehensive.
The objective of this resolution is threefold.
The Council now also shares this concern.
I am counting on your support in this!
Thank you very much, President-in-Office of the Council.
This is what I propose.
I wish my views to be recorded.
Of course.
Nothing has been fixed here.
A few words now on the mid-term review.
It is hugely important that these reforms should work.
A few words now about Parliament's resolution.
That is completely impossible.
Is that right?
This is the matter addressed in Parliament's resolution.
We should therefore provide for compensation.
Small farmers cannot take responsibility for everything.
I believe there are four particularly important principles.
The first is price protection.
The third principle is stability.
I am certainly not leaving for reasons of pleasure.
I can do no more about it than you.
There are four reasons for this:
Thank you, Mr President.
Any reform should be centred on farmers and consumers.
Before 2008 or not?
The European Parliament wants codecision here.
We want codecision for both agricultural policy and finance.
But decoupling direct payments can also have its disadvantages.
However, I cannot imagine either working in practice.
We welcome and support its objectives.
Nonetheless, some very worrying elements remain.
(The president cut the speaker off)
Aid is welcome, but it is simply aid.
It states that partially decoupled aid is essential.
I simply want to make that criticism clear.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We need to think long and hard about this.
I congratulate Mr Daul heartily.
The mountains do not want to be a problem.
We must decide to call them by their name.
That is all very well and good.
So we and the Commission have time to reflect.
In conclusion, I would like to ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
How will the policy eventually look?
How long will the reforms take?
Thank you very much, President-in-Office of the Council.
That is quite extraordinary for the Council.
And why?
The floor is yours, Commissioner.
The so-called 1994 framework agreement was one of them.
This is the approach we should adopt.
What lies behind this declaration?
How should we behave towards North Korea now?
The EU has little influence on North Korea.
This was not the case.
We have proved to have been horribly right.
It has blown up a South Korean civilian airliner.
Pursuant to Rule 37(2)
The Commission will participate as an observer.
This document is due to be adopted in Seoul.
The conclusions could become altogether meaningless.
The debate is closed.
They are old friends.
In particular, they are concerned with safety standards.
These requirements also have an impact on safety.
The rapporteurs have done splendid work.
Two of the amendments deserve special mention.
That is therefore what will happen.
That is the essence of the fundamental amendment tabled.
The report was adopted unanimously in the parliamentary committee.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
.
The school books are nothing to write home about.
They are continuing to repeat the old patterns.
These were extreme nationalism and ethnic hatred.
Industry has been decimated or allowed to decay.
More of the same is no longer enough.
It should have a long-term view.
We cannot confuse the different types of funds.
The report highlights these problems clearly.
This part of Europe is a multi-speed region.
Joost has already listed the deficits.
I am referring to the Dayton Agreement.
They have many problems in common.
That is the litmus test for our credibility.
It is also its most severe test.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
In any case, that is short-term thinking.
I would like a roll-call vote on this tomorrow.
There are two things on which we can agree.
This will have to be taken into account.
Environmental conditions have to be mainstreamed.
We must ensure our policies do provide for cohesion.
The same applies to Community initiatives.
And how will action on cities move forward?
And rural areas?
What is the backdrop to the debate?
The first point concerns the current programming period.
So what do we conclude from all this?
Measures to achieve economic balance have been inadequate.
My region is an Objective 2 region.
We must prevent any increase in differences.
That is another issue to be studied.
We in this House want to help you.
The new regional policy must also be simpler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Completing the internal market
I suggest we begin with the Commission.
We shall now hear Mr Bolkestein.
Cross-border banking fees were astronomical.
Consumers simply got a bad deal.
We need to open up further the network industries.
We need to deal with the pension time bomb.
We need better and simpler rules.
Rules need to be transposed on time and correctly.
We have our work cut out.
I know that none of this is easy.
I expect the report to be ambitious and hard-hitting.
I am sorry that I was a little late.
The EU is currently facing great challenges.
The forthcoming enlargement is vital.
We must find a solution to this.
The Presidency accords high priority to the matter.
These statements are very important and very timely.
You do not need to wait for the Commission.
So, please, Council, take the initiative.
What is in it for them?
How does the market work for them?
The same applies for certain social conditions and constraints.
Thank you, Mr President.
Directives need to be transposed with greater speed.
I am the rapporteur for these directives.
The associations and societies must be given due importance.
I have noted the views expressed today.
It is an extremely important matter.
This is perfectly true.
Mr Harbour commented on services.
This point has also been mentioned by others.
The Commission is favour of liberalisation.
Privatisation is not the concern of the Commission.
However, liberalisation is indeed our concern.
Economic clout is necessary for political clout.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
We are grateful to you for this analysis.
The debate is closed.
I will come back to them shortly.
Thank you, Lord Stockton.
I hope that this clarifies the issue.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
Thank you, Mr Perry.
Please allow me to make a personal comment.
Thank you for your observation.
His case is very simple.
He was given no reasons for his dismissal.
It is quite right to underline those references.
These quasi-forms of independence and self-employment are spreading.
I would like to make two points.
The first one concerns the definition of employees.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Thank you Mr Ford.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The remainder is deleted.
I hope this will prove to be acceptable.
This threat is unacceptable.
The Council should actually do something about it.
.
We must congratulate ourselves on this.
First of all, greater transparency.
Secondly, a matter of rigidity.
This is too rigid.
.
.
.
We shall see this more clearly tomorrow.
In fact, the problems remain.
The Brussels European Council confirmed our worst predictions.
.
.
.
Who will end up paying for this?
The winners will be the large agro-industrial companies.
.
.
Otherwise, we believe the report to be sound.
That is why I shall support Amendment No 10.
.
.
.
I also regard the candidate countries with concern.
.
That concludes voting time.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Monday:
But I take note of your request.
Tomorrow is absolutely impossible.
The main rapporteur has suggested today or tomorrow.
I have just seen that the Commission is present.
Perhaps that could be a reasonable solution.
Wednesday:
(Parliament agreed to the request)
Thursday:
(Parliament agreed to the request)
(Parliament rejected the request)
No change.
I count on your cooperation.
We are hoping for immediate decisions from the Commission.
This directive refers to liability for environmental damage.
I consider this to be an extremely important issue.
That would be my personal preference.
Nothing has happened to date.
Local divers have already recovered over 200 bodies.
It is not a question of religious opposition.
These people deserve a dignified recovery.
Are we Europeans so powerful, then?
This is a scandalous state of affairs.
I take note of what you have said.
Mr President, on a point of order.
We all feel powerless.
I have tried to find it in the newspapers.
The emission of CO2 must be drastically reduced.
Fortunately, there is also some good news.
That concludes the item.
and
The reality was much more prosaic.
What are the principles which should underlie our approach?
Avoiding media concentration is also important to our economy.
Many things have happened over the past ten years.
Why has no progress been made?
It would be interesting to analyse the matter.
Is it because it is very complicated?
It is more than that.
It is for us to restore this balance.
The wide-ranging nature of concentrations merits particular attention.
Action is needed, O esteemed Commission!
We must not let it become one.
Mr Segni therefore has the floor for two minutes.
That was something on which we did not yield.
That is twenty-first century dictatorship.
The situation can worsen as a result of concentration.
Neither will free commerce necessarily ensure diversity.
The European Convention must also discuss this.
Take Italy, for example.
This is the case almost throughout Europe.
We must reflect on all this.
The name to mention here is Berlusconi.
It has already had the worst of the fight.
How is it going to be defined?
Those issues are already there.
Do not ignore them.
I agree with what Mrs Hieronymi said.
That is the question.
I say yes, we do.
We must not poach on the territory of others.
That is not the case!
All the speakers present in Parliament have now spoken.
I have received six motions for resolutions
Far from it.
We have to live in the real world.
We have to recognise the legal constraints.
A final thought for now.
This proposal has been very carefully constructed.
We simply cannot afford to let that happen.
Rules on radio broadcasts across borders are also acceptable.
Yes, of course it is.
Hardly anyone takes up smoking because they like it.
They do so for other reasons.
This is why people take up smoking.
Image has everything to do with it.
I should like to make two final observations.
They obscure the proposal's legal basis.
This is an example of extreme inconsistency.
This is nothing to do with the precautionary principle.
We will not be satisfied with half measures.
It is all a pretence.
We will see what happens tomorrow.
In short, the law has rights too.
Is this wise?
This argument also puts the case for European legislation.
This is as the current legislation stands.
The second point is the ban on Internet advertising.
As Mr Tsatsos pointed out, tobacco kills.
May I add a few examples?
This is unnecessary and would affect our political credibility.
Let us therefore approve the proposal as it stands.
It derogates those powers to Member States.
This is a real test of that.
That is what we are saying in this case.
All the others, the Commission rejects.
Indeed there are different views in Member States.
We have done that.
That is why the legislation was annulled.
I brought the judgment back to Brussels.
The Court has spoken clearly on the subject.
We have followed that carefully in our drafting.
This is also my answer to Mr Harbour.
But do not just take my word for it.
Of course, it is.
Let us not leave it there.
Follow the advice of the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Financial conglomerates are important players in European financial markets.
The business and financial markets are global markets.
The Council has now arrived at a common position.
The debate is closed.
Initiatives in this area must be recognised and encouraged.
Allow me to outline some of them.
We agree that specific situations require specific measures.
I would like to congratulate Mr Souchet on this.
I believe that the Commission is hearing this message.
Truly impressive.
This cannot be completely justified.
Should they be thrown overboard or taken somewhere?
It will therefore be very difficult to sell this.
In any event, they are still necessary.
This simply cannot be allowed to happen.
The Irish Sea is a biologically very sensitive area.
They call for more technical and human resources.
They want more money for research.
Predatory fishing becomes the norm.
Reform is not the solution.
The CFP cannot be reformed.
It has proved to be incapable of reform.
Sometimes over-fishing is discussed but these issues are not.
It is a tragic reality for many species.
Today, this is all but impossible.
This is a fact!
That is why they are now absolutely necessary.
What shall we do, therefore?
That I will not do.
Am I a puppet; are we marionettes?
Granted, we all want to be re-elected.
We must keep our heads.
Why should this be so?
Is a workable EU fisheries policy achievable?
The common fisheries policy goes too far.
It does not make sense.
We have a common agricultural policy.
It makes no sense.
That should also apply to fish.
It would make a lot more sense.
Madam President, the CFP has totally failed.
Fish do not swim separately in the sea.
The 6- and 12-mile limits must be confirmed permanently.
In the North Sea cod is disappearing.
It is not a coincidence.
We must do something about it.
Again, is this a coincidence?
I would agree here with Mr McCartin.
What an indictment of the common fisheries policy!
It beggars belief.
Nobody is disputing that.
That has certainly been the case in Canada.
Let me return to a number of specific points.
It therefore demands a specific approach.
That is what we have put forward.
Access to waters and resources involves two issues.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
and
It is based on a dual principle.
This needs to be ratified.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.09 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
I refer to structural grants and agriculture.
(Applause)
Yesterday was also historic in a way, however.
It was, of course, an informal meeting.
Radical reforms have been carried out.
Democratic structures have been developed.
That is a gratifying development that must be maintained.
It will also be reflected in the forthcoming debate.
There is no mention of either 2005 or 2004.
That is something I want to make absolutely clear.
They are requirements that must be met.
There is no room here for small-mindedness.
The Commission takes the same view.
The same applies to the Commission.
(Applause)
- rapporteur.
This comes as no surprise.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Finally, we are not accountants.
Such arrangements are in no way a handicap.
Enlargement of the EU is where our future lies.
Malta also has a profoundly European heritage.
(Applause)
The implementation of policy costs time and money.
We are asking a great deal.
Slovakia has drawn a line under its Meciar past.
The European Socialists have always fought for enlargement.
Bulgaria has made great strides in recent years.
There are still major areas of poverty.
I commend Romania's progress to this House.
Things are different now.
I reject a line of reasoning of this kind.
This would be a mistake.
This serves a practical purpose.
This is also for Turkey's sake.
That has to be clarified.
These have to do with two very real problems.
The second issue has to do with Turkey.
Many difficult issues have been resolved during the autumn.
This is an alternative to membership.
What does this mean in practical terms?
The pace of reform is the main issue.
Another point is Turkey's candidature.
The countries in Europe should be vigilant about nationalism.
The same applies to the European Union.
The Helsinki Council made Turkey an official candidate country.
My thesis is threefold.
Thank God that was not the case.
It is about reversing the effects of Yalta.
It has never once been unified.
And it does not always get it.
It is absurd from every angle.
I mean what are we doing, penny pinching?
It is beyond me.
Bulgaria and Romania have the same right.
Finally, to Cyprus.
We must support these negotiations.
We must hope they turn out well.
In my view, these demands are quite legitimate.
This linguistic problem is a sign.
Thank you Mr CoÃ»teaux.
Secondly, we are also voicing a great hope.
We shall construct the new Europe together.
It is a real danger.
In actual fact, this is not enlargement.
They are just as European as we are.
That brings us to the subject of Turkey.
We Europeans have a duty to help this country.
But of course the criteria cannot be geographical.
This is a considerable step forward.
This must be welcomed.
Thank you.
Your comments have been noted.
However, the job is not finished.
'Realpolitik' is not necessarily synonymous with greed.
I do not agree with such points of view.
Mr President, these are without doubt important times.
I have two questions.
He is generally punctilious in attending our sessions.
For ever!
That is a violation of the acquis communautaire.
This is clearly at odds with the acquis communautaire.
The first protective coating is inadequate in any case.
I do not take this fundamental assessment for granted.
That also applies at regional and local levels.
That especially applies within agriculture and within infrastructure development.
These people are being badly informed.
What is required is simply unfeasible.
Europe is at a crossroads.
Together we will succeed.
That would be in the interests of us all.
They are of course focusing on the past again.
Since 11 September this has become even more important.
Unemployment has risen and wage differentials have increased.
What is the Commission's view on this?
This is a question for the Council.
I condemn this move.
I am thinking of Volkmar Gabert and Egon Klepsch.
We do not need a post-war order in Europe.
This is an historic day in Parliament.
I myself come from the Baltic region.
How welcome are we?
That is not acceptable nor is it wise.
Two chapters remain to be closed.
But we are not under any pressure to move.
Is that not pure opportunism?
Is it not beyond belief?
It is intolerably dishonest.
It is particularly dishonest to the Turkish people.
The road is still not an easy one.
We are making this offer even now.
We have been arguing about Turkey since yesterday.
That is the main problem.
I will be perfectly honest with you.
That is now history.
I will try to be brief.
Therefore I fully support the proposed target date.
I welcome the positive statements on Turkey.
We cannot be selective in the application of principles.
The current enlargement process is not yet completed.
We all hope that it will be a success.
Ten new countries are about to join.
May everything go according to plan!
Let us work together to make it possible.
The work of enlargement must proceed further, however.
The new Member States must be treated with respect.
Such friends are valuable at this time.
The timetable for 2004 is a tight one.
This means that the work cannot stop with Copenhagen.
I think that this sums up our situation perfectly.
They are not arriving in a ready-made world.
This is far from being the case.
Europe gives itself to those who support it.
That is the way things are.
Major progress has been made, however.
Otherwise, we shall have problems.
I think this debate has been very helpful.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 7.20 p.m.)
Commission annual legislative and work programme for 2003
Mr President, honourable Members.
But the results so far are very encouraging.
President,
Honourable Members,
So it is naturally our top priority for 2003.
The priorities identified by the Commission are:
Â· an enlarged EU,
Â· stability and security, and
Â· a sustainable and inclusive economy.
We spoke extensively of enlargement yesterday.
We must not see our borders as a wall.
Our neighbourhood policy needs to be spelled out.
This approach needs to be applied pragmatically and progressively.
Honourable Members,
In historical terms it is still in its infancy.
Thank you.
A final point on the economic and social priorities.
We prefer a framework directive.
This should be linked to the issue of immigration.
In any event, this is a constitutional issue.
Good governments make strategic choices.
They set political priorities.
This is reflected in the annexes.
That is simply not the way to proceed.
We feel this should be done independently.
I will believe that when I see it!
The Commission programme makes fortress Europe even more impenetrable.
The form, however, is still highly ambiguous.
It nonetheless raises an important matter of principle.
If it is there, it is well hidden.
Mrs GrossetÃªte mentioned our plans for the Mediterranean.
I fully agree with her.
I have no objection to this.
An agreement with Parliament is clearly necessary.
We are extremely concerned about this.
This is something which should concern us all.
This is the way we must approach the issue.
We now move on to the catch-the-eye procedure.
Have we any news on this?
For us, as socialists, stability is important.
In practice however this is still not happening.
When can we expect to see this specific regulation?
I think this sounds excellent.
I am referring to Europol and others.
I am less optimistic about immigration policy, however.
Mrs GrossetÃªte asked the Commission for more initiatives.
I would ask the Commission for fewer initiatives.
My final question relates to Natura 2000.
I find this extraordinary.
I do not find this acceptable.
This House and the spring summit have been ignored.
Mr President, I have two questions.
The first is about securing our external borders.
We will have common training programmes.
When do you think the system will be operating?
My second question is about migration.
My queries relate in particular to internal behaviour.
I regard them as being the naughty boys.
We talk about relations with Moldova, for example.
That concludes the catch-the-eye procedure.
Efficient legislative programming effectively means two things.
The first of these is the enlargement of Europe.
The Zagreb Summit is coming up.
Yes or no?
I think we can agree on this, Commissioner.
I will say something about that in a moment.
There is one thing that I find totally incomprehensible.
That really is not acceptable.
That has to be the right way forward.
The same goes for the Court.
I repeat, I share the Commission's objectives.
That is an incitement to separatism.
Then there is our role in the world.
I am therefore grateful for the work carried out.
We must continue along this road.
I believe that the possibilities for improvement are favourable.
An agreement has been reached on the minimum necessary.
These are not going to be weak or unclear.
This is an ongoing battle.
We are on track.
The Commission has invested a lot in this issue.
The final speaker is the President-in-Office of the Council.
Silence please!
I believe that we can reach agreement on that.
But this is all just a recommendation.
Thank you very much, Mr Haarder.
Mr Haarder is nodding in agreement.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the vote.
Before the vote:
Before the vote on paragraph 3:
I take note of your comments.
However, the date ought to be changed.
Before the vote on paragraph 9:
Before the vote on Amendment No 51:
I hope that the mover can accept this.
Before the vote on Amendment No 42:
These amendments are compatible.
That is why we vote.
We have the chance to register our views.
Before the vote on Amendment No 10:
Amendment No 6 now makes further changes.
Thank you for that early explanation of vote.
Before the vote on paragraph 71:
Before the vote on paragraph 102:
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
I can only lament this short-sightedness.
(Loud applause and heckling)
Thank you for that vital explanation.
(Laughter and loud applause)
(The President declared the common position approved)
This is a second reading.
The procedure came under paragraph 4, Mr Corbett.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Before the vote on Amendment No 32:
We will make the linguistic corrections after the vote.
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
There is a significant problem in Scotland.
.
I proposed an oral amendment to this resolution.
That lies upon their conscience.
I therefore voted for it.
We have therefore rejected this amendment.
A newly reunited Europe cannot legitimise collective expulsion.
.
Generosity will vary.
The report contains some very positive elements.
.
We also reject the positive assessment of NATO extension.
These changes have since been overshadowed by others.
.
1.
2.
.
.
.
It is in practice an additional consumer tax.
It therefore puts a strain on the poorest households.
We voted against this report.
.
How could it be otherwise?
.
.
.
This is the focus of the report.
.
.
I shall highlight the following examples:
.
.
.
This is a very sensitive area of policy.
We abstained from voting on this report.
.
.
clearer marking and identification of vessels,
dissuasive and uniform sanctions.
.
Make of that what you will.
.
Let us support the tobacco growers' efforts!
.
We must stop this hypocrisy.
Smoking kills.
This must stop!
A safeguard clause must therefore be included.
.
I find this intolerable.
.
.
The proposed new programme has four strands.
Energy is a major concern for the European Union.
There is a good reason for this.
Take the example of drugs money.
.
.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
.
I cannot, of course, accept this situation.
Furthermore, the report heaps scorn on international fisheries.
.
This will reduce the number of artisanal fishermen.
The rapporteur does not contemplate this in any way.
The report however offers no such protection.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
The outcome of the vote was as follows.
1.
2.
3.
4.
General reserves: this part was adopted.
The relevant services have therefore made the necessary change.
Very well, Mr Wynn.
This was a key point for both parties.
The summit condemned terrorism in all its forms.
The European Union will monitor developments closely.
Other important issues were discussed at the Summit.
The on-going conflict in Chechnya featured prominently among these.
This is also valid for Chechnya.
This negative view really needs to be aired here.
It concerns both Chechnya and Kaliningrad.
On the contrary, we need to stand firm.
Now let me turn to Kaliningrad.
This must not be allowed to happen.
Russia is a big partner for us.
We are thus a giant trading partner of Russia.
To their credit, they do not.
The first one is about Kaliningrad.
Secondly, Chechnya.
I believe this to be an aberration.
At the beginning of October my delegation visited Murmansk.
Prior to 11 September, the situation was simple.
What is currently at stake in Russia is democracy.
That would have been entirely possible.
Today we are moving in exactly the opposite direction.
Fortunately we can now talk of constructive cooperation.
Rightly so.
I think that we must make this a priority.
The borders with Russia and for example Latvia.
In fact nothing else needs to happen.
This is a very important commitment.
This is not the problem.
We will discuss this matter on another occasion.
Is Crown Resources a Russian company?
We need something stronger.
It is time for the stick.
They were deported by Stalin.
So how have we reacted?
So why did the Council then shift to Brussels?
What is the situation in Chechnya?
Let us not mince our words.
What is going on now in Chechnya is genocide.
It has certainly been a lively debate.
Mr Nielson has confirmed this today.
Everything has been done by the book.
Of course not.
So nothing was forgotten.
There was nothing that we should be ashamed of.
Everything was done by the book of democracy.
Stick at it.
That is a good clear description of the reality.
I have listened very carefully to all the contributions.
Unfortunately there has been no progress.
I would therefore advocate caution.
This is a very worrying situation.
Madam President, this is a long story.
Chechnya has been suffering for three years now.
This is an intolerable situation!
I was there two years ago.
My area of responsibility is not being neglected.
Thank you for that illuminating response.
Taken together, these factors gave cause for concern.
Negotiations are not yet complete.
This finally took place on 16 November.
How can you regard this as cooperation?
Did you actually read our report?
Yet never once did anyone challenge our ongoing assessment.
Who influenced you?
Who pressurised you?
This is precisely where our main concerns lie.
This was an historic moment.
These elections are a step in the right direction.
All parties in Pakistan welcomed these elections.
They have just elected a Speaker.
They are about to elect a prime minister.
Let us now look forward instead of looking back.
That meant that military governments repeatedly came to power.
That was bound to lead to tensions.
I say to the Council that I expected more.
I expected honesty and I expected the facts.
We all want to see democracy restored in Pakistan.
The general took over in a coup.
Unemployment, poverty and illiteracy are increasing.
I therefore support Mr Cushnahan's statement here today.
Thus a declaration by them is also entirely independent.
And both countries have nuclear weapons.
That is important.
I liked what Mrs Lynne said about the process.
We must avoid over-simplification.
We talk more about democratisation than democracy.
Let me make one comment about the cooperation agreement.
I believe that is our common hope.
I have received five motions for resolutions
This is where all the problems start, however.
We consider this a totally unacceptable situation.
In any event, everything requires full investigation.
Finally, I have one further question.
I just cannot understand that.
That is the problem we face.
It simply requires some further discussion.
These were a couple of issues.
Mr President, the Council was quite convincing.
The question is why the Commission proposed this.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on:
Let us remember what we are trying to do.
Inevitably this is a learning-by-doing process.
That is explicitly stated in the EFC's report.
It is not an interinstitutional group.
That is clear.
They cannot give their approval to a particular outcome.
In my view the report is very focused.
Indeed it is a monopoly of initiative.
I welcome this announcement.
I do not find this sensible.
This is precisely why this broader debate is needed.
Finally, a word about this Lamfalussy procedure.
Nor are we fundamentally opposed to extending it.
And we have not yet achieved that final result.
This is all about constructive mutual cooperation.
Temporary means temporary.
Accordingly, it must have a call-back power.
I appreciate the Commission's commitment on this issue.
It aims to introduce genuine coordination.
The goal is to achieve faster and better legislation.
In general terms, we endorse it.
We all agree that this issue requires democracy.
That is legal mumbo jumbo.
That is very important.
I wager it would not.
That is only to be expected.
It is not a case of unitary supervision.
I can well understand Parliament's various wishes.
I consider them entirely legitimate.
Parliament is able to exercise that influence.
Again I agree with her.
Mrs Villiers is very much against.
It does not commit you to anything.
He calls the Lamfalussy procedure the Lamfalussy-von Wogau process.
He said that it is a temporary solution.
I agree.
Mrs Randzio-Plath said that it is too early.
That is an argument that she has used before.
Let me repeat what I said earlier.
I agree with her.
That discussion was very fruitful.
I am certainly cautious in all I do.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
Where, then, are the points of difference?
This overhaul is both timely and welcome.
The new rules will be much simpler and clearer.
We will have a clear and transparent authorisation procedure.
Millions of chickens are imported from China and Thailand.
We must be consistent here.
This cannot be justified to consumers.
My second point relates to the duration of authorisation.
I ardently support the ban.
A certain period of transition is therefore required.
I enthusiastically support the rapporteur's proposal.
It puts right an unacceptable situation.
Further work over the years confirmed these findings.
I can broadly support the Commission's proposal.
The ban on their prophylactic use can be supported.
For us farmers, this is vitally important.
That proposal will take account of your concerns.
The Commission can accept these amendments.
I invite the rapporteur to speak again briefly.
Commissioner, I have a further question.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Let me start with the objectives.
What are the main objectives of this proposal?
There are three.
First, the scope of the new simplified procedure.
Such information exists for many traditional herbal medicines.
Secondly, the minimum period of use.
Finally, the new Scientific Committee.
A different situation applies to rational phytopharmaceuticals.
Their use goes back over millennia.
This directive allows the basic registration of traditional remedies.
This basic safety requirement is a modest proposal indeed.
What is in it?
What will it do for me?
What do they fear?
How many tests have been conducted on side-effects?
How many off-the-shelf shops offer expert advice?
Let us welcome it.
Mr President, any medicine can be dangerous.
My group will therefore support it.
Clearly, this is most certainly a good idea.
I believe that his amendment is sensible.
The first has on its label echinacea root.
However, the others simply are not good enough.
This lottery has to end.
These are just brief extracts from an 83-page report.
There is no justification for it.
I declare an interest.
I use herbal medicines every day of the year.
Many speakers have mentioned the minimum time of use.
However, there will be exceptions.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
It has taken nearly a year.
All this I can see in the proposed directive.
Their assault focuses in particular on three things.
Unfortunately, she has not listened to that advice.
There are problems in practice, however.
Reaching this outcome was a difficult task.
We should pursue that balance between flexibility and security.
This is a codecision dossier.
One is 'day one comparability'.
The second is the comparator.
Another area of concern is the temporary-to-permanent contract fee.
This directive possibly changes part of the regulation.
They cannot be working in a vacuum.
This is precisely what we are trying to change.
The necessary flexibility is further safeguarded through wage negotiations.
That is a fact.
This we must prevent.
This we cannot accept.
This is no way to negotiate.
We cannot deal with codecision this way.
This is intolerable!
More jobs can provide both.
That is absolutely right.
That is wishful thinking.
That is not so.
The Irish experience will demonstrate that is not so.
There is not adequate protection.
There is none.
Nor is this a one-size-fits-all directive.
There is scope here for various national choices.
I would very briefly like to make three comments.
That would make the directive an empty shell.
Such a definition without the concept of remuneration?
That takes the biscuit.
That would completely nullify the principle of equal treatment.
The aims of the proposal we are discussing are:
to guarantee the rights and safety of temporary workers;
and to increase flexibility in the labour market.
The employers did not want this, however.
That was the reason, Mr Crowley.
It is also a transboundary issue.
That is actually what it is all about.
As a Swedish Social Democrat, I disagree.
This information must come from incorrect sources.
This is a case of discrimination regarding pay.
The provisions should therefore apply from the first day.
It could even constitute gender discrimination.
All workers have a probationary period.
In Sweden, permanent employment is the rule.
There you are, Mr Andersson.
Europe needs more forms of employment, not fewer.
We are not at extremes in this area.
It is a balance which should be struck.
We want to find that balance.
Do we not want supply to meet demand?
Mr Crowley has a comment on procedure.
That is a good suggestion!
I would say they are completely unfounded.
There are two types of amendment.
We also accept the amendments that clarify the text.
The remaining amendments are rejected.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
rapporteur.
This represents a genuine sea change.
Biotechnologies are part of the technologies of the future.
Europe is lagging behind the United States.
This is broadly supported by Mrs DamiÃ£o's report.
However, the proposed strategy lags far behind expectations.
The report rejects this position.
The report says that it must end by 2003.
DNA tests are not services like any other.
There are many reasons for this.
What does this mean in practice?
This is not what is said here.
That is what it says here.
Let me clear up this misunderstanding from the outset.
There are two points I should like to make.
What does the Commissioner intend to do about it?
It also has incalculable effects on ecosystems.
Genetically modified foods and agricultural products are a flop.
The consumers do not want them.
Where is the market, in reality?
Biotech companies are complete flops on the stock exchange.
Let me come to my real point.
I also find what is happening here quite unacceptable.
The current report demands the very opposite.
I think this is farcical and quite unacceptable.
The Commission calls for this as well.
Biotechnology cannot be allowed to dominate over everything else.
We must be wary of the sorcerer's apprentice.
Research forms the basis of our future competitiveness.
In this context, biotechnology offers many opportunities.
We want sustainable agriculture in developing nations.
The debate is closed.

EIB Annual Report (2001)
I could not agree with you more.
First of all, capital increase.
My third point concerns labour market policy.
My final point concerns monitoring.
Thank you very much.
I would nevertheless like to make some observations.
The role of the EIB is important.
Finally, there is the question of monitoring.
It also generates money itself by issuing bonds.
Madam President, I warmly welcome this report.
Why should the EIB have special status?
That is something I absolutely cannot accept.
I shall briefly mention the other four priority axes.
In this regard, there is therefore no problem.
These activities, naturally, also need monitoring.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
New regulations and Community guidelines have been drawn up.
In 2001, the Commission issued five prohibition decisions.
The first point concerns the length of investigations.
We are in favour of establishing global rules.
You mentioned various alternatives.
I am delighted to hear it.
We have already discussed this with you at length.
A great deal of progress remains to be made.
They particularly advocate redeploying aid towards the horizontal objectives.
A re-examination of steel aid is essential.
Encouraging greater competition is an enormous task.
This is a most useful tool.
This is not always the case however.
Many significant events have taken place since then.
He has done good work.
Clearly, this is nothing new.
I am sure Mr Lipietz would agree with me.
I am therefore bound to agree with the rapporteur.
I refer to the three rulings.
On the contrary.
I am confident that this network would be effective.
Competition policy must champion the concept of equal opportunities.
This is with a view to protecting local employment.
Neither can they be rejected wholesale, however.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
Competition policy prohibits both State and private monopolies.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
This is his second visit to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
Transparency is not guaranteed.
I consider this to be an unacceptable situation.
(Loud applause)
I hope that you will receive a positive response.
I would ask the Quaestors to investigate the matter.
Thank you for your comment, Ms Thors.
Mr Pronk, do you have any objections?
It deals exclusively with the issue of human cloning.
The debate has already taken place.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That will be the first line.
It is the Greens.
.
.
I should like to illustrate this with three points.
The first one is the Interinstitutional Agreement's scope.
The second point concerns the threshold values.
I think it should be the other way around.
.
.
.
.
Smoking kills, the litany is becoming tiring.
.
.
Probably the latter, it would appear.
.
'Why ever not?', I asked her.
Integration cannot be legislated.
They pay very dearly for their status.
The social reality is intractable.
Are temporary workers just like any other worker?
No they are not!
.
This helps SMEs.
.
.
We cannot acknowledge these results.
.
However, the condemnation does not go far enough.
These elections were not democratic.
They were conducted like a commercial transaction.
We therefore abstained.
'We are already doing that,' I replied.
Maybe some pharmaceutical companies, or some hospitals.
.
This principle should not be lost through EU coordination.
We therefore abstained from voting on this report.
I do not support the cloning of human beings.
Neither, however, are completely watertight.
.
.
We all agree that tax evasion should be stopped.
Everyone should fulfil their duty to pay taxes.
There is a clear distinction between the two.
.
We would then be wasting Community funding on bureaucracy.
.
.
We hope that this case law will be confirmed.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
I cannot however become involved.
Nevertheless, your comments have been noted.
Why are we not facing the battle?
That is not an insignificant number.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Let me briefly address some shortcomings.
This is obviously a crucial question.
We certainly missed her in New Delhi.
Unfortunately, the opportunity was missed.
It consistently avoided references to deadlines and specific objectives.
We had in mind Russia in particular.
India is home to a thousand million people.
I found it fascinating, but also frustrating.
The draft declaration itself was rather weak and disappointing.
It was a fascinating exercise.
The debate is closed.
.
Sadly, the Commission has today been proved right.
Unfortunately the Council did not follow our advice.
There are lessons to be learnt from all this.
The first lesson is crystal clear.
The immediate action required is obvious.
Almost all of it is covered by Natura 2002.
They must be put into practice now.
The standards specified in existing provisions must be applied.
The European Maritime Safety Agency should start operations too.
Discussions with the COPE Fund ought to be pursued.
This is over and above standard compensation.
It complements the FIPOL Fund.
Heavy fuel oil is the most dangerous product.
Consequently, stricter safety measures are needed.
We need to go further.
These could almost be termed ports of convenience.
Clearly, the answer is no.
It has to send out a clear signal.
They must come into force.
The Commissioner referred to double hulls.
Perhaps others could offer more than my region.
The sea is Galicia's life.
These measures must be strictly implemented as from tomorrow.
We must insist that Member States do so.
We now call on them to respond in kind.
Any assistance offered to Galicia will be welcome.
More than 300 km of coastline have been polluted.
Information has failed too.
Nonetheless, further action is needed.
Community aid must retain its credibility, however.
The victims' interests must come first.
This was clearly not the case here.
I have a question concerning airports.
No provision has been made for this.
We should do this.
We therefore need to improve our rules.
Commissioner, do not hesitate: go right ahead.
We voted on two blocks of measures.
Many of them are good.
Inadequate for two reasons.
So what do we need to do next?
We obviously need a set of measures.
We need to help these people.
I do not think that anyone would question this.
Flags of convenience are a blight on the system.
Parliament will give it speedy consideration.
The stable door had clearly not been locked.
A true catastrophe is unfolding before our eyes.
Galicia's green coast is gradually turning black.
The indignation is growing by the hour.
There is something fundamentally wrong with our transport sector.
They are sharks that slip through the net.
So where is the problem?
I think that it was stated by Mr Varaut.
Until when?
You know the result!
That is enough!
It needs to be applied.
In 2000, six.
In 2001, two.
In 2002, twelve.
Those are the statistics.
That is what I am saying.
This is not a criticism of any particular port.
And I have asked for information.
But the problem is not with any particular port.
That is what I am talking about.
How many more?
Well, that is my point.
The problem is that the Governments are behaving incoherently.
And that is what the current problems stem from.
Aid, ladies and gentlemen.
We are working on this.
What we clearly have are the FIPOL funds.
The second issue.
Strictness in application.
We are talking about going further.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Civil war has been raging there for 19 years.
Human rights continue to be treated with contempt.
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
The spiral of ceaseless revenge has not been broken.
Members of Parliament are put in prison.
Several thousand people were arrested.
Leaders of unpopular NGOs were also arrested.
Many are being tortured.
Hundreds of injured detainees had to receive hospital treatment.
In the last month alone there were 25 deaths.
Thousands were arrested and held in incommunicado detention.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Naturally, it is important not to isolate Iran.
It is schizophrenic.
Mr President, I disagree with Mr Markov.
Iran is a complex society.
Mr President, this motion is about three points.
(Sustained applause)
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately after this debate.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
That is all, Mr President.
Before the vote on Amendment No 1:
This has set the standard for future plenary sittings!
Congratulations are always welcome!
I should like to know what was their decision.
.
That would only slow down the decisions.
.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 5.55 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
You can write to the President.
In other sectors developments have been less satisfactory.
The reform is progressing positively.
I thank you very much for your attention.
That too is untrue.
I will end with two questions.
The new Financial Regulation gives its Directorates-General decentralised responsibility.
So let me express my gratitude for that.
(Applause)
I should like to start on a positive note.
This is the good news.
One major point that is left is enlargement.
In my view, this is highly contradictory.
It is not a particularly attractive development.
You will be aware that I am that MEP.
It would then get rid of the management.
But not so in the EU.
I find the report very enlightening.
Is this really going to change this year?
We fear the worst.
That is the question that is essentially being raised.
We look forward to your forthcoming decision.
But what did you write?
We would really like that answer.
Was it the Chief Accountant at the time?
Was it the Director-General of Budgets?
Was it you?
Was it some secretary?
What is going on within your systems?
We want reform.
It is over-complicated and is badly presented.
I think this is an unacceptable degree of complacency.
Thank you very much.
Why do we not give the error rate?
If only!
That is the reason.
What for?
Mr Dell'Alba said that he is worried.
I believe we should all be worried.
A Commission in which I see daily changes.
It is true, they cannot.
And do you know why?
Because this is not simply a face-lift.
The Commission is undergoing a profound change.
He failed to give me an answer to this.
That is all.
Let me start with the latter.
The final and decisive negotiations are now taking place.
Enlargement does not end in Copenhagen, however.
The institutional questions are pressing.
This was also the case with previous enlargements.
I personally sympathise with this view.
We cannot in decency do otherwise.
I am looking forward to our debate.
This dialogue is very important.
What is on the agenda at Copenhagen?
Basically three points.
I will expand on these three points today.
We, however, do not share their view.
That plan has our full backing.
Lastly, a word about Turkey.
It also noted the remaining difficulties.
The new Turkish Government's legislative programme confirms this.
The European Union must encourage this process.
Above all it has given them hope.
Do you think I do not know that?
We have often spoken of a window of opportunity.
That must stand centre-stage.
And now for Turkey.
The law matters to us.
We are becoming susceptible to extortion!
I still maintain that criticism.
I will briefly respond to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
I should not now enter the debate.
First, the praise.
I hope for a 'yes' vote.
What are the deadlines?
How are they to be met?
We must reach an interinstitutional agreement.
That is the most important thing.
We cannot decide on Turkey's accession plan now.
How about that?
This is how we could move things forward.
The Council is wrong, the Commission is wrong.
Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam.
We always have to repeat the same thing.
This is unfair, as Mr Haarder also said.
Today, things have changed.
What has all this got to do with Copenhagen?
A great deal!
This story is paradoxical.
We must fight for freedom and for Europe.
One last comment on the subject of the IGC.
We should be clear on that.
For once, I disagree with Commissioner Verheugen.
This is the opportunity we have to seize.
This is not a constantly elastic process.
At some point we must say no.
Berlin and Brussels cannot be breached.
What did you actually do?'
Are we really going to say that?
Because it is going to sound very lame.
Let us not lose sight of that.
Why is this?
That is sending the wrong signal.
Everything should therefore balance out in the end.
What brings us together?
Where must our borders end?
I know that Poland has a pain threshold.
They are meant to be fully involved.
All of us here are talking about EU unification.
Is this the EU as a peace project?
This must be investigated in Copenhagen.
I would like to see this question investigated.
Is this reasonable?
Is this the EU as a peace project?
But how can this be done?
That is a sine qua non.
That would allow us to go forward more speedily.
So what is the problem?
Let me make another, additional comment.
I should like to make one brief comment.
Evidently we also need to talk to each other.
We have learnt that these are political decisions.
I fully agree with Mr Titley.
It must succeed.
Concerning Turkey, the basis is clear.
Turkey is a candidate.
The ten countries will take centre stage there.
That is precisely the problem.
We are not like that at all.
Now a brief word on the subject of Turkey.
Mr Nassauer spoke to me about it in person.
I should just like to make two small points.
That is why the decision was necessary.
That is the full background.
That concludes the debate.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
Turkey cannot demand a date in Copenhagen.
and
We are all equal here.
It is high time.
I believe everything about this plan is well balanced.
Everything else is virtually identical in content.
Let me remind you.
What happened?
But it is not the subject of this resolution.
That does not however apply to taxation arrangements.
The ball lies in Parliament's court.
Mr President, sincere thanks for your work.
We have made progress.
That was a long time ago.
Of course those questions need to be settled.
I am quite familiar with the legal problems.
There is a time for everything.
Omnia tempus habent.
It will be virtually impossible afterwards.
'With pomp and ridiculous display,
The Politician's corpse was borne away,
While those around him carped and slanged,
I wept: I would have seen him hanged.'
All our actions must take this objective into consideration.
Obviously we find this unacceptable.
Let us be honest therefore.
Tomorrow everyone can decide which side they are on.
It consists of three parts.
I wonder what the public would make of it.
We are special.
What do we have on the table today?
Confused?
I certainly am.
So, what are we discussing here?
But, help is at hand!
That paragraph is tabled individually as an amendment.
That is one problem.
The answer is yes.
I said that quite clearly.
The Council will not submit a detailed proposal.
That is an answer for Mr Lehne.
The ball is in Parliament's court.
The Council has of course given clear signals.
That concludes the joint debate.
Please let this be Europe's last oil disaster.
The Council must now take decisive action.
'Nunca mais' - never again.
Thank you very much.
and
The Commission has therefore set up a task force.
The scientists have also pointed this out.
I can only quote them.
Those are only some of the catches of course.
What does this all mean for our fishermen?
Secondly, we propose a new fleet policy.
Thirdly, we propose closer surveillance of fisheries.
Now to the Structural Funds.
This policy involves three specific measures.
I do not think so.
We propose setting up a scrapping fund.
That is an emergency measure.
There are two main elements to this.
I will not comment on other Commission aspects.
Our heart is with them at this time.
I want to speak about the cod crisis.
We cannot continue fishing in this way, however.
What are we really doing there?
What are our plans for sustainability?
We have fished ourselves into a catastrophe.
Help us, help the Galicians.
Which European region is most vulnerable to maritime accidents?
Which region has suffered the most accidents?
Which region is most dependent on these resources?
Europe owes Galicia a debt.
Let us now talk about fisheries reform.
Let us stop being hypocritical.
Are you forgetting the agricultural surplus?
We must analyse the matter.
Thank you all very much.
Now it is your turn, Mr Fischler.
That is all I have to say.
We need to go further.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Fishermen share common interests.
This plunder must stop.
These waters must be protected.
I agree with his analysis.
I agree with his criticism.
I will be supporting his reports.
Quite the opposite.
It therefore has a crucial role.
I have one last comment to make.
For whose benefit?
How can we avoid this pernicious effect?
We would like answers to all these questions.
That reminds me of a joke.
Oh well, be that as it may ?
Harsh words, but I stand by them.
Hardly the real reform everyone supposedly wanted.
That is just plain stupid.
Sad, but true!
So we are formally in support of the resolution.
They could thus defend their interests more forcefully.
Northern Ireland fishermen are opposed to the present proposals.
That is something that is very important.
As you see, this is an age-old problem.
We cannot simply discontinue cod fishing.
I am thus pleased with Mr Stevenson's resolution.
Privileges are being confused with the conservation of resources.
This principle is not being applied.
(The President cut off the speaker)
In their current wording, these proposals are unacceptable.
Whatever solution is agreed, change is inevitable.
They demand a total ban.
Are we listening to their advice and suggestions?
Parliament is on your side.
What sort of boats are involved, however?
You want to find a solution without increasing capacity.
Fine.
Why was quota control not in place?
Let us mainly focus on these issues.
I cannot endorse Mr Varela's reports.
I have said that this is too little.
Now to the cod plan and the oral question.
Why is the situation in Iceland better?
Now to the reports.
Now to access to waters and stocks.
And so to fleet policy.
I also accept Amendment No 78.
And that includes quota reductions.
Now to decision-making procedures and consultations.
Now to the final proposal on scrapping.
I am delighted that you support this proposal.
Now to the proposed amendments.
The Commission already passes on the information called for.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
No it does not!
Angola's fishing industry is extremely interesting.
There are now 16 third country agreements in place.
There is a better way.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
WRITTEN EXPLANATION OF VOTE (ARTICLE 120)
This is the absolute limit of industrial fishing.
I am delighted that Parliament supports this approach.
So what next?
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Simplification is more important than streamlining.
It must be people-friendly.
It must be family-friendly.
Europe is sorely in need of one.
What do I mean by that?
This must be our starting point.
Coordination cycles do not examine economic relationships between countries.
I shall now turn to institutional procedures.
I agree with the principle of streamlining.
We should use the current mechanisms.
We really must be allowed enough time.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Clear progress indeed.
We must examine the work tools used in enterprises.
This is a much discussed subject.
We have only to look to our own experience.
We know, therefore, that noise is noise.
It is not just a question of being combative.
Progress is painfully slow.
The directive is to be welcomed.
It will bring about direct improvements.
Workers will be exposed less to noise at work.
I grant you that.
I agree with that.
This legislation does not reflect the real world.
The UK Conservative response will not be limp.
I thought that sense had triumphed!
A huge amount of work went into that position.
That is why I will be voting in favour.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
I believe this has proved to be a mistake.
The data is required every three years.
Work on alternatives is progressing fast.
Transgenic animals must be included.
There are four amendments to the report.
I can support Amendment No 3.
Parliament adopted the proposal in July 2002 without amendments.
I have tabled three amendments.
We must establish some clear ethical rules.
I am delighted with this report.
No, you ask yourself, can they suffer?
And that they certainly can.
I want to say two things.
Why are we doing this?
Is it being duplicated?
What will the results be?
The debate is closed.
Short-term residence permits
.
They turn it into an empty shell.
That must be our goal.
Deleting this provision would completely distort the directive.
We owe aid and assistance to the victims.
She herself mentioned a number of proposals.
That, precisely, is one of the problems.
Directives do not help, therefore.
In effect we are talking about the same terms.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Mr President, this is not a procedural issue.
.
We therefore have two proposals for reform.
The first concerns the appointment of the Commission.
More sensitive decisions would clearly require enhanced majorities.
There are other concerns too.
Who would elect the President of the Union?
Who would this President be accountable to?
The third point concerns our external representation.
I would like to outline these briefly.
The goal of the Convention has become more ambitious.
I am pleased to see this development.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We believe it is a good proposal.
Although in your case it was by acclamation.
This would ruin the balance between the institutions.
(Applause)
I nevertheless welcome what President Prodi has said.
The same applies to European democracy.
Let us speak, however, in practical terms.
What is at stake here?
This is, furthermore, our duty.
Yes, but to whom?
That, however, is a biased approach.
Let us talk of a Constitution.
Therefore, a union of States and citizens.
Therefore, the debate is an open one.
I therefore believe we should give this some consideration.
And there is much more besides.
I can see many positive points in your proposals.
Let me pick out one of them in particular.
How is that to happen?
By a majority or unanimously?
What do you have in mind?
Does Parliament have the right to dissolve the Council?
That is what I would suggest.
So how will that work out in practice?
Will you resign every time?
It is simply a recipe for confusion!
He also represented opportunism on a large scale.
There is already a federal currency.
The federal army will commence operations next year.
Federal law and order are being got ready.
That is a good feature of his proposals.
Why do I say that?
We will see in the coming days.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The question of accountability remains.
I regard this as a very difficult situation.
That is all it says!
Consider migration and in particular the Vitorino proposals.
Aux armes democratiques, President Prodi.
Convention, seize your opportunity!
One last point.
We feel it is worthwhile and relevant.
I have a question to ask, however.
These two positions must coincide as far as possible.
We think this Congress a bad idea.
This is what the Commission is proposing.
I have read a document running to 23 pages.
And what does the Commission say?
This is of course quite impossible.
That is the principal message.
We must get that through in the Convention!
A few very brief comments.
(Applause)
Thank you, President Prodi.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
After the vote:
Could that please be corrected?
That will be recorded in today's Minutes.
(Parliament adopted the text)

Before the block vote on the committee amendments:
.
After the block vote on the committee amendments:
I would be truly grateful.
Before the vote on Amendment No 20:
This article should be voted on.
Let me read out what the President ruled.
This is what we did.
Rapporteur, I owe you an apology.
I apologise.
Okay, I resign!
(Laughter)
Nothing more.
You are absolutely right and I apologise again.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
.
My justification for this is as follows.
I have here the electronic record confirming its transmission.
Therefore our original motion has priority.
(Applause)
There is every justification for proceeding in this way.
Everyone knows that as soon as ?
Listen, and speak afterwards.
(Applause)
The requests before us are clear.
I see no point in extending the debate.
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)

Joint motion for a resolution
I asked to speak because Mr Watson did.
(Loud, prolonged applause, heckling)
I do not need to add anything else!
Mr President, my group respects the other groups.
Thank you.
I do not want to take any more contributions.
I want to make one brief comment.
We have adopted a resolution today.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
.
.
Hence our abstention from the vote.
.
.
A development I cannot support as a sovereignist.
This constitutes a hidden trade barrier.
.
.
.
We constantly hear of plans for mass redundancies.
.
.
.
The opposite is happening, however.
.
This is why I reject this compromise.
.
This is often reflected in constituency cases.
That was the reason for abstention.
This is not a particularly one-country point.
Should we do away with fishing altogether?
.
Catch quotas and even catch bans are becoming inevitable.
This mainly applies to Spain and Portugal.
He has largely succeeded in this.
.
Yet there is one question which nobody is asking.
.
It does not respect the precautionary principle.
.
.
.
This also applies to fishing, and increasingly so.
This situation should end without delay.
It will be fundamentally our problem and our responsibility.
.
These are:
.
Moreover, MEPs are elected in national contexts.
.
We therefore voted against the report.
.
We cannot fall short of these minimum requirements.
I voted against the report.
.
.
Among other aspects:
I voted against this programme.
.
What about the other Member States?
It is high time we did something about this.
.
.
The rapporteur's proposals are unacceptable.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament
(Applause)
We certainly need to achieve economic and financial integration.
I rebel.
(Applause)
We cannot turn a blind eye to this situation.
We must not advocate a return to populism.
Something, however, must be done.
That is dangerous.
What do we tell them?
We believe in democracy.
Something is happening in the region.
We must be careful.
I am in favour of this.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
This comment concerns a State policy decision.
(Applause)
Do not give us milk.
Do not give us your agricultural products, please ?
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
You tell us we should operate an open economy.
Yes, I agree.
Open up your markets.
(Applause)
I like equality.
I know you are doing this out of kindness.
They do not want to be offered crumbs.
(Applause)
We were handed a de-institutionalised country.
We have the responsibility to restore faith and confidence.
The Atlantic has become less of an obstacle.
Latin America is trying to achieve its own integration.
(Applause)
I would like to thank the President.
We thank you for your message, Mr President.
I declare the formal sitting closed.
Resumption of the session
Tuesday
Tomorrow at noon we will award the Sakharov Prize.
Wednesday
We therefore oppose the Socialist Group's motion.
They will be here until 7 p.m.
The order of business was thus established.
I will inform you of those.
Work is already in hand regarding this matter.
You do not need to resort to lip reading.
Just read the record.
This is such an exceptional case.
I will come back to you on this matter.
I would like to thank you for this.
This is a serious responsibility.
I plan to be with my family.
This complexity can certainly be explained and justified.
No one understands anything.
Make of that what you can.
Secondly, a legislative bloc.
A legislative bloc is simple.
These, therefore, are the main points.
It is a difficult subject.
I commend it to the House.
Quite the opposite in fact.
The rest is mere detail.
I believe this is the wrong way around.
I should like to say one thing.
We will therefore be voting against this particular point.
You urge us to do this.
You tell us you are aiming to simplify.
You call for Article 202 to be reformed.
In the EU, we have thirty different instruments.
So let us not have any unfounded accusations!
This report is indeed remarkable in many aspects.
Mrs Randzio-Plath has emphasised this point, moreover.
The first was raised by Mrs Frassoni earlier.
I am indeed talking about implementing measures.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
His report therefore deserves wholehearted support.
I see that Mr Krarup is here.
You will not get a majority in this House!
That was an aside.
The rule of law will sustain irreparable damage.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Again, we think this is an important step.
We are quite pleased with that as well.
I support the rapporteur's three amendments.
Asbestos is a silent, invisible killer.
I welcome the amendments that have been agreed.
Thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
The consultation received a polarised response.
There are many misconceptions about this technique.
Irradiation is just one method of food preservation.
Why do we do that?
The question is, why is this being done?
Is it really for the benefit of the consumer?
The proof has not yet been provided.
It is a touch too difficult to monitor this.
We recommend the latter alternative.
This requires further investigation.
Labelling should not function as a warning sign.
Different arrangements exist in the fifteen countries.
European law is not applied properly in this area.
Irradiation is not necessary.
There are many alternatives.
It is not as negative as he suggests.
That has been changed quite significantly.
Different countries have different lists.
That is the committee's broad view.
Well, it is safe.
The WHO says so.
It can protect food from contamination.
The Commission is in listening mode.
We needed cool, calm reflection on this.
We are looking for something a little more measured.
And what has happened?
The detection methods are in place.
The Commission, though, is getting cold feet.
Why, then, do they not want it?
It is then that the hygiene argument is produced.
That is what this procedure is there for.
Thank you very much, Mr Schnellhardt.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
That is remarkable.
It means that class war is being waged.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 8.20 p.m.)
.
Other sources mention up to 10 million.
The consequences were catastrophic for everyone concerned.
We advocate three months.
Greater attention must be given to bio-safety.
To do so would indeed be irresponsible.
Let me just say something about the voting.
Against that, we must be armed.
My services and I followed your work very closely.
I welcome this trend from a consumer perspective.
We cannot ignore this.
Our approach to FMD has to adapt accordingly.
My remarks now are therefore confined to future policy.
I will now turn to contingency planning.
The challenge is to act on these lessons.
We covered businesses right across the European Union.
That was a direct reference to the British Government.
This must never happen again.
This is why this temporary committee was set up.
I think not.
What do we do now?
What decisions must the European Union take?
I opposed this.
None of the experts we consulted was in favour.
The foot and mouth crisis cost almost a billion.
That is untrue.
We have evidence in plenty.
It should also have monitored its adequacy.
Diseased pigs were not reported - bad farming practice.
Neighbouring sheep became infected.
Eight amendments have been tabled to correct these errors.
Hearsay and hindsight have been the chief witnesses.
The reality is that the contiguous cull was legal.
Vaccination would not have worked in the UK situation.
That was the reality.
Insufficient resources have been allocated to that important task.
It felt that six months was sufficient.
In future we must have proper contingency planning.
The costs of that policy have been greatly underestimated.
The report admits that.
Fact and fiction have been confused here.
For years prophylactic vaccination protected our livestock.
Such was the impact.
That indicates the impact this crisis had on people.
The Commission and the Council have a heavy responsibility.
They cannot brush aside this report by Parliament.
Yes, there must be emergency action plans.
We must also ensure good monitoring at all times.
I am in complete agreement with all these points.
We cannot leave it at that, however.
A political wish list is not enough.
Confidence in politics suffered a heavy blow.
It was all very vague.
Politicians who shirk responsibility destroy the credibility of politics.
Parliaments must be involved.
The reactions have been very clear.
Just as people believed this of human tuberculosis.
Export interests have replaced animal welfare and human ingenuity.
So many people are protesting.
Thank you.
Unfortunately they were successful.
Export interests were placed above all else.
That is a good idea.
What is necessary is a return to prophylactic vaccination.
The first thing we must do is understand.
There is no denying that mistakes have been made.
I commend Commissioner Byrne's team for their work.
Where should it begin?
We should not be attempting 20:20 hindsight.
You never know what is going to happen.
The past is being rewritten here.
That is not right.
I prefer to look ahead.
Finally, I would like to thank the Commissioner.
People felt a sense of anger and despair.
This must never happen again.
That is what has to be addressed.
This report and investigation brought home the wider effects.
The reality is that we were very lucky.
Let us not underestimate this.
They have been more effective than we have been.
There was an impact on a really human scale.
Setting up the committee has been a worthwhile exercise.
I am sorry it was such a struggle.
His report is first-rate.
Others have touched upon the details.
I do not want to do that.
I would add flexibility in ring-vaccination.
I would merely like to make four comments.
I would also like to thank all my colleagues.
We should stress this again and again.
No to prophylactic vaccination; yes to ring-vaccination.
We are backing the Commission's proposals.
The disease could easily happen again anywhere in Europe.
They have worked very hard on this.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
It is a matter of urgency.
No new amendments have been tabled here in plenary.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(Parliament agreed to the change to the agenda)
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
Thank you very much for this clarification.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I think we should take the second option.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
and
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
.
I also want to tell you why.
You simply have to bear that in mind.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Get the French army out of CÃ´te d'Ivoire!
The military was above the law.
Were they the only war criminals?
In this way we can discourage repetition in future.
.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
.
Disqualifications should remain a matter for intergovernmental cooperation.
.
.
We must put an end to this situation.
We think otherwise, however.
.
A total of 30 countries presently take part.
The motion contains worthwhile comments and proposals.
.
.
Mr Bourlanges' report will contribute significantly to this.
.
Hence our vote against the report.
The answer is clearly 'No'.
.
.
.
The report is, therefore, unfortunately basically flawed.
.
.
I reject claims regarding the legality of the cull.
It is very easy to be wise in hindsight.
Any report such as this requires accurate information.
.
Overall, I am happy with the text adopted.
Not so.
My constituents expect no less.
No prosecutions of any complaints occurred.
Lapses in bio-security.
Investigations proved no such lapses occurred.
The culls were pronounced illegal.
The European Commission was informed at all times.
Breaches of environmental legislation.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
This train has been withdrawn by a unilateral decision.
Is there a follow-up to this type of request?
(The Minutes were approved)
Rapporteurs:
Mr FÃ¤rm, in relation to Section III, and
Mr Stenmarck, for the other sections.
These are things that have worked well.
That is an entirely unreasonable model.
Certainly, I accept budgetary discipline.
There is no sound long-term budgetary methodology.
It is criticism that I consider to be unfair.
The second priority was to implement necessary reforms.
Parliament's legislative function must also be strengthened.
The third priority is to tackle all this successfully.
We have succeeded in doing this.
In my judgment, this is possible.
That is what the Copenhagen Council decided.
I believe that to be deserving of particular mention.
Honesty demands that we say that.
We are well below them.
Even so, we have already tackled them.
That is why Commission reform is extremely important.
Enlargement is the hallmark of next year's budget.
My group supports this.
Perhaps the Commissioner knows.
And that is good news.
Not to mention Heading 3.
And that is just to mention two headings.
All well and good.
The resolution talks of 'excessive surpluses'.
Surely that must give us pause for thought.
Other examples abound.
After all, the citizen foots the bill.
There are in any budget process successes and failures.
For my group, this is an essential point.
They were stuck and could not get out.
They replied: 'Yes, we are!'
(Applause)
I have to say that I find this scandalous.
That has not been complied with.
A representative Parliament must decide on all expenditure.
The answer remains in the air.
The start of 2003 was a difficult budgetary year.
The reality of enlargement is upon us.
Even now the hotels are struggling to cope.
How can these be reduced?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Last week we had Copenhagen.
This is absolutely vital.
Copenhagen is a historic milestone.
We cannot build a European power with miserly States.
How will things go next year?
People are reluctant to look closely at these.
The first is external trade.
The next round of WTO talks is imminent.
The debate is closed.
What is going to happen next with this report?
I believe that this report suffers from excessive optimism.
There are two objective factors here.
I very much welcome your remarks, Commissioner.
I agree with that.
Have those barriers come down yet?
If not, when will they come down?
Because not just any reform will be sufficient.
So this is national policy.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I have two questions.
This therefore is our approach.
Horizontal services will provide targeted support.
This communication is divided into three parts.
The standards in question are in fact very new.
The system currently used for accounting is Sincom 2.
But what do you preside over now?
This information was not derived from the annual budget.
Take the fixed assets, this building for example.
That will also be decided by this Standards Committee.
I have a very precise question.
The new system must be operational from 2005.
This met the standard and it was followed.
That is not correct.
I turn now to Mrs Theato's question.
What will happen in the meantime?
Work is of course being done all the time.
Thank you very much, Mrs Schreyer.
Please cooperate.
Mr President, I will gladly answer the question.
The final point of order.
I asked who that person was.
The authors of the questions have naturally been informed.
Part I
Subject: Border controls in north Africa
The content of the programme will subsequently be determined.
This is quite clear.
However, Morocco also implements its own measures.
Subject: Abuse of EU research legislation covering orphan drugs
Subject: Chechnya - Commissioner Nielson's visit
The longer answer is as follows.
Mr President, just two specific queries.
We are clearly worried.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner de Palacio
Subject: Taxation of fuel supplied in Gibraltar
Subject: EU-wide nuclear regulation
This was appalling of you.
You have actually got it wrong, Commissioner.
This is excluded under the Euratom Treaty.
Subject: Independence exercised by the Commission
This type of visit to the Commission is normal.
But let us not confuse complaints with petitions.
Subject: Starting date for Third Road Safety Action Plan
Subject: Protection of Ireland's rail freight infrastructure
Subject: Air transport and noise
Following the adoption of Directive 2002/30/EC
Questions to Mr Kinnock
Subject: New Berlaymont building
I apologise for his absence.
Subject: Commission officials moving to private companies
That is a good thing in itself.
Do written promises by those concerned provide sufficient guarantees?
But an impression has been created.
Thank you very much, Mr Kinnock.
Questions to Mr Monti
Thank you, Commissioner, for your answer.
This brings an end to this Question Time.
We recognise your personal courage.
The Sakharov Prize celebrates that commitment annually.
You do not walk alone.
You do not work in isolation.'
In that way we will build a true peace.
We do not have a single weapon.
That is the liberation we are proclaiming.
They are not exclusive.
That is the main cause of our poverty.
Thank you and happy Christmas.
(Standing ovation)
Madam President, I thank the Commissioner.
In the spirit of conciliation that is quite satisfactory.
Other countries have had similar experiences.
We must continue with the voluntary ethos.
What must we do now to restore this confidence?
Definitely not.
Blood and blood products are not goods.
There is also an ethical risk.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Commissioner, you have the floor.
This is the case for both Thailand and Brazil.
Perhaps I should explain the background to this.
These include missions to Brazil and Thailand.
Consignments which test positive are destroyed.
I am happy to outline that for Parliament.
Nitrofurans is a generic term.
One very important product it covers is Nifursol.
I admit I am not a scientist.
I therefore have a few questions.
What are we to say to the fatteners?
What are they to do?
What forms of treatment are available to them?
So we do not need to go there.
On what basis was that decision to be taken?
There is another problem that needs to be clarified.
Is it sent back?
What is done with it?
Why are these missions being postponed?
Is the SANCO DG under pressure from other directorates?
How is that possible?
Why were four weeks allowed to elapse?
My second question is this.
On 2 October you relaxed controls for Vietnam.
That is a Commission decision.
I will read you what it says:
That simply does not happen.
That is a very serious decision to take.
This is not an inconsiderable issue.
All the time we keep this under review.
That was the appropriate response in those circumstances.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The Commission believes that this is a positive outcome.
Simultaneously, a risk reduction strategy will be developed.
This is an important step in the procedure.
I hope the Commissioner will confirm that tonight.
These substances are long-lived and bio-accumulative.
It can also be converted into brominated dioxins.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
1. waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)
Madam President, this is a difficult text.
What is the point of it?'
That is the reason for this directive.
They enabled us to reach agreement on difficult points.
We have set binding targets.
I think that can be called a success.
The Member States can decide that individually.
I believe this was also a good step.
That is not necessarily my group's normal position.
We want to reuse raw materials in future.
This is an important step for environmental policy.
During the discussion we have gradually come closer together.
We went from 6 to 4 kilograms.
I should like to invite them to Belgium.
We are doing that to tight deadlines.
That is why binding targets are good in themselves.
We simply export a host of problems.
The principle is contained in the directive.
I learned a lot and enjoyed myself greatly.
It is a splendid piece of legislation.
This is an historic breakthrough.
Is this really what Monnet planned?
Surely there is a better way.
This is a substantial and very important proposal.
That means things can get much cheaper for consumers.
Another point is the bans on substances.
Thank you very much, Mr RÃ¼big.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
This is not just any solution, either.
Another important outcome of the negotiations concerns payments.
That is why this is an important step forwards.
Finally, I would like to cite a case.
Thank you very much, Mrs Hautala.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Now we are attempting to protect ourselves.
That is why I voted for the DamiÃ£o report..
I nonetheless regret the reference to management and labour.
Danish presidency
That was a great and positive experience.
Side by side, hand in hand.
This can be seen from our achievements.
We achieved a breakthrough in EU transport policy.
First there was the flooding in Central Europe.
I shall now return to the Copenhagen Summit.
These were intensive, difficult negotiations to the last.
This provides a sensible framework for this fundamental issue.
We arrived at a balanced and realistic answer.
This is the way it has to be.
Then there is Cyprus.
Bulgaria and Romania will take part as observers.
The Danish Presidency is now drawing to a close.
This picture is echoed by Danish government ministers.
A new Europe is born.
Thank you, Mr President.
We have delivered.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
This is the new strategic objective of my Commission.
Most of these fears are groundless.
(Applause)
Such success was not self-evident.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
No national parliament can do that.
(Applause)
It will not happen the other way around.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Let me make a comment on Turkey.
(Applause)
Congratulations on what you have done at Copenhagen!
(Applause)
I believe you deserve special congratulations for that.
The question is transition.
Many issues are currently under discussion.
Will this change or not?
What will happen about Members of Parliament?
I am sure you will do this.
However, we must not be complacent.
Beware of the boomerang effects of internalised humiliation!
The citizens of the current Member States are too.
In this respect, too, we need initiatives.
We cannot build anything sound or sustainable on revenge.
'Lads, you were wonderful!'
You did fantastically well!'
But we have to say what they are.
Is that one of the Copenhagen criteria?
This is where we need a road map.
I approve of what the Council has said.
For this, you must be complimented.
Madam President, honour where honour is due.
Subsidies to the rich countries must be eliminated.
There is Moldavia too and Israel.
The Zakayev affair has not been resolved, however.
They are well deserved.
It was an outstanding achievement.
That is what they said, loud and clear.
Congratulations.
We have a lot to celebrate today.
There is still a lot to be done.
We cannot take the people's assent for granted.
We must stop playing games with each other.
The EU is no Christian club.
The will was there.
Your efforts will go down in history.
After Christmas, the work now begins again.
The EU is to be reformed.
The EU must become more democratic.
Referendums must be held.
I think that this can perhaps get forgotten.
This is the other side of the coin.
That cannot be right.
What will we do as regards Chechnya?
Will we allow Russia to call the tune there?
(Applause)
Is this in fact possible?
Are the European institutions sufficiently credible?
Should we not make more efforts in this regard?
Is this what we are called to?
You will have to convince the public.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I also endorse the remarks of Mr Verheugen.
I hope we learn the lesson of Nice.
That is a message for all of us here.
I think that this is a very good thing.
The other is to do with agriculture.
This is a great opportunity for Turkey.
I object to this.
Everyone concerned is to be praised highly for this.
Once again, therefore - congratulations!
I shall tackle two specific points.
Enlargement emphasises just how important our neighbours are.
These are Belarus, Ukraine and Moldavia.
This is good for both Russia and the EU.
Surely not!
I want to quote an example.
There is nothing romantic about financial issues.
We have to have talks about this.
This Parliament forms part of the budgetary authority.
What must then happen while negotiations are in progress?
Will the National Security Council have to be abolished?
These Europes did not exist back then.
The European Council has made progress on three dossiers.
Nonetheless, there is some justified criticism.
Mr Titley, the Iron Curtain is not disappearing.
Instead, it is only being moved.
My compliments to Mr Rasmussen in particular.
Turkey is a great deal more difficult.
The system is too deep-rooted for that.
I will therefore limit myself to a few points.
There has been a parallel achievement in southern Europe.
We can be proud of this result.
The candidate countries are also deserving of praise.
This was of course not without problems.
I think that this is very important.
Those are his ideas.
It is this European Parliament that needs more powers.
Information, communication and reform continue to be needed.
The debate is closed.
Who are they trying to fool?
Do you want statistics?
When prices increase, the value of wages decreases.
This can result in increasing intransigence in wage disputes.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
In short, the joint text lays down:
.
That concludes voting time.
The minutes from yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
I share your concern, Mr Bautista.
(The Minutes were adopted)
These include accelerating the phasing-out of single-hull tankers.
Today I must reiterate this.
(Applause)
These are the factors we need to promote.
We must also make progress at international level.
(Applause)
Mr President, this is not a natural disaster.
The time for talking is over.
We must draw up a rule for this.
We must have this.
We must avoid this kind of thing in future.
Let us tighten this up for hazardous ships.
The one must not take priority over the other.
What is done is done.
I hope that everyone concerned realises this.
Galicians are admirable.
So action is needed at international level.
So what exactly am I getting at?
Port controls are vitally important.
Should we toughen and change transport legislation?
Yes.
Should we reprimand ministers?
Yes.
But we need to do more.
We Galicians are strong.
Why not?
The Commission's response would appear to bode well.
I call upon the Council to be equally courageous.
This must never happen again.
Never again!
There is also the question of liability.
What do the conclusions say?
These statements are very revealing.
Where are the concrete measures?
What is happening with port controls?
How much longer are we going to wait?
How many more disasters must happen?
We must take action.
Subsidies will not help to repair the environmental damage.
The environment must be preserved.
What use are our directives on protection?
Things just never change.
This is the way Europe works.
I find this particularly regrettable.
In short, bold political decisions are needed.
Firstly for prevention.
This is of course unacceptable.
Must we investigate all these aspects?
Yes.
Should we prevent them?
Again yes.
The European Commission has learnt its lesson.
Secondly, cure.
The real victim is the entire people of Galicia.
An inquiry?
Of course.
Mr Haarder, the Prestige sailed past Copenhagen.
Let us remind ourselves of the route it took.
This is where we need to make pilots mandatory.
Let me give you two examples.
What grounds have we heard here?
Measures to be adopted; Spain has adopted measures.
The fishermen are being paid, aid is arriving.
Therefore, what are the justified grounds?
They do not exist.
That is what we are working on.
.
There are two types of liability.
That is what we are talking about.
And what does this mean?
(Applause)
Because that is when accidents take place.
And that is what we have to deal with.
We must provide a solution.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I really do not understand Mr Galeote.
Mr President, a saying is a saying.
This has been said here, literally.
That is what I meant.
Let us consider this issue closed.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on
.
These two were approved a couple of weeks ago.
I agree that matters have proceeded too slowly.
It is important that the deadlines are met.
This programme complements other Community cooperation and development instruments.
Certainly more could have been done.
As a policy issue, immigration is simple.
What should we do?
The House would like answers to all these questions.
That is exclusively the responsibility of the Member States.
The same applies to the standards for expulsion.
Such cases naturally occur in all countries.
Its legitimacy naturally depends on our approval.
We are therefore justifying this approval now.
None of them have been adopted.
And we know who they are.
This is not Mr Haarder's fault.
Nobody objects to hiring young students either.
Allow me to stress two points.
These issues are real issues.
These policies are making the problems worse.
This danger is now present within Europe.
I will refer firstly to immigration.
The Council has opted for a highly unilateral approach.
I agree with that praise.
The global perspective is easily lost.
What is required?
Mr Haarder is well aware of this.
A humanitarian EU must be able to do better.
Unfortunately, they are.
Lastly, a fundamental question.
It is essential.
It is not a fortress Europe that we want.
In any case, it is unacceptable.
But that is not what they are about.
I very much regret this.
.
He was the chairman and I was a member.
So I think we have achieved a great deal.
Similar efforts are in progress in other countries.
For this aspect of the matter must be included.
So thank you for your concern.
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino.
Could I have a precise answer to this question?
I would ask you to be brief.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow from 11 am.
That is our limit.
I have the greatest sympathy for regional languages.
Subject: Expulsions in Northern Cyprus
Subject: Integration of third-country nationals
However, we still do not have this directive.
Subject: Common patent system
This must happen, however.
We must get this matter finalised.
Subject: European Constitution
What view does the Danish Presidency take of this?
I shall simply answer your question, Mr Martin.
Is that the Council's view?
The Council has no view.
I shall spare him that.
Subject: Cyprus
Subject: Funding for the northern part of Cyprus
Each knows exactly what the other is doing.
Mr Solana would go to Cyprus straightaway.
Subject: Repercussions of enlargement on the least-favoured regions
Copenhagen speaks exclusively of limitations.
Subject: EU-US 'secret agreement' on criminal matters
The principle is real exposure.
Thank you very much for your kind wishes.
Subject: Weapons used in Afghanistan
European Year of Education through Sport 2004
The Council shares our view on this.
Rather, it is the starting pistol.
We should take the greatest possible advantage of this.
In other words, this is naked propaganda.
There is no justification.
These must receive support and assistance.
Afternoon clubs organised voluntarily often do valuable work.
Why can we not talk of sport as sport?
I can let you into another secret.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
The history of the Community has always been consistent.
Since then, the Commission has done little.
It has submitted four documents.
We are already holding this discussion at this moment.
However, the Treaty is undeniably lacking in clarity.
That question was put to the citizens of Switzerland.
This guarantees social cohesion across Europe.
Why?
They must therefore no longer be subject to competition.
We must be ambitious for social Europe.
And what is the Council doing?
Services of general interest support and sustain growth.
They sustain environmental sustainability.
They will enable citizens to commute and to communicate.
Thirdly: has its quality improved or got worse?
However, that is part of the job!
This is extremely disappointing.
Is an ambulance service an economic activity?
Yes or no?
What do you mean by 'open'?
Both interpretations make me uneasy.
With an open outcome?
We have already moved on too far for that.
My second point is as follows.
This concept must therefore be introduced.
Lastly, Commissioner, beware of ideologies!
The god of competition does not need a monument.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
I thank the Danish presidency very much.
(Applause)
Now I turn to the formalities.
A vote is necessary to confirm the following corrections.
Secondly, the result has been announced.
We have done it in record time.
I am quite happy to follow your advice.
Thank you for your constructive cooperation and your attention.
The Prestige accident occurred on 19 November.
The proposal as it is violates certain principles.
Firstly, it violates a procedure that is transparent.
(Mixed reactions)
(Applause)
(Parliament approved the proposal for a regulation)
(The President declared the common position approved)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
Mr President, my voting buttons have malfunctioned.
I wanted to vote against!
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
I wish you all a very happy Christmas.
Happy Christmas!
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
.
.
.
.
.
That is why I am voting against this.
.
It does not cover other countries.
.
We do not.
We have, therefore, voted against your self-congratulation.
It also represents an opportunity.
.
.
There are five million Danes and five million Scots.
The Netherlands' calculated efforts in particular have failed.
.
I have voted in favour of the resolution.
.
.
.

You are completely misinterpreting the Rules.
Mrs Lulling, this is then in your hands.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
It is still a descriptive annual report.
Some Directorates-General are not making commitments in this area.
More rapid progress is being made in some areas.
I hope that will be picked up again.
There is also some delay on that.
This needs to be pursued with great vigour.
What is the reason for this delay?
Can the Commission tell us?
Why is this decision so long in coming?
It is very important that we take equality seriously.
Many women are looking to the European institutions.
Many of them live far from our prosperous Europe.
One does not choose to be born a woman.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENTS (RULE 120)
We cannot conceive of it failing to do so.
Europe has a duty to set an example.
I thank Mrs Kratsa for having pursued this approach.
The Commission can only offer encouragement in this field.
And yet these regions warrant particular attention.
Mountain areas offer a huge variety of riches.
The same applies to tourism.
I would even say that they suffer genuine deprivation.
I will not add anything regarding agriculture.
Agriculture remains essential for safeguarding mountain regions.
They need special status as sensitive areas.
This is what the Commission should be doing.
That would have been very welcome.
This is a conflict.
That is disgraceful.
Firstly, they are seeking recognition of their handicaps.
The Commission has been completely inactive in this area.
The picture you painted was not quite accurate.
Because the inhabitants of the mountain regions are few.
What, then, can we suggest?
The debate is closed.
It is not only I who am concerned.
That policy must be respected.
Madam President, one country, two systems.
No!
I shall give a couple of quotes.
That was in front of our Members very recently.
I put it to you that there is concern.
That will probably happen in February 2003.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Some of the Arab districts of Jaffa were destroyed.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Hebron is a blatant example of apartheid.
Today the same is happening on our very doorstep.
And we just stand and watch.
It is not our job to complain.
Our job is to intervene.
An end to settlements!
They get us nowhere.
An end to destruction!
It gets us nowhere.
And an end to terrorist action!
It gets us nowhere.
No other policy makes sense.
It is no good being in the audience.
Thank you for listening and Merry Christmas.
It is killing them.
More than three hundred homes face destruction.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
There are, however, many more prisoners.
I only wish that it did.
That is not how matters should proceed.
Political opponents are simply treated as common criminals.
.
We regarded these as two very positive signs.
Are the hardliners getting the upper hand?
We have heard some alarming reports recently.
International standards were breached.
This is a flagrant violation of international human rights.
We were talking earlier on about mountain regions.
There were even extremist movements in our European democracies.
That is the way to fight terrorism and separatism.
Those who spoke before me discussed this.
I think that we should seriously ask that question.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place directly following the debate.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Prior to the vote on Tibet:
.
That is a good point.
We shall make sure that happens.
Please will you note that I voted in favour?
We have noted the fact.
The vote is concluded.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
But that is not even true.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 5.25 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
We expect him sometime soon.
Monday
He will be here later.
You are too late to change today's agenda.
Thursday
That is hardly a matter for the agenda.
It should be raised at another time.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you Mr Gollnisch.
We are dealing with the agenda.
Brussels part-session, January 2003
Wednesday:
That is something we must not do.
It is an information brochure and a comic strip.
I understand that the document has not been withdrawn.
The international community must act on this issue immediately.
This should therefore be an occasion to celebrate.
You mentioned Roy Jenkins in your opening remarks.
Your visitors from Greece will be adequately covered.
I certainly intend to be there myself.
They are all under 25 years of age.
None have criminal records.
This is a matter of great urgency.
We will refer that matter to the President.
That concludes the item.
What rights should we give to our regions?
What responsibilities should we give them in the Treaties?
On all these issues there is consensus.
My group is offering a compromise on this question.
The committee would therefore be a sort of filter.
To circumvent the national level would be completely reprehensible.
That surely is important.
Many other such examples sprint to mind.
That's too close to Lunnon for my liking.
'What's a Luxembourger?' says my mate.
It is a price not worth paying.
Quite the opposite.
That would be impossible to manage.
This is very regrettable.
Europe's roots lie at local and regional level.
That is what European added value actually amounts to.
All this is happening against the background of enlargement.
It is a Union of States and peoples.
No country can impose its system on another.
Europe is a contract, not a constraint.
It has been changed back to tomorrow?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
There are two problems causing this.
Human rights are universal, indivisible and interrelated.
The human rights discourse is by definition global.
The European Union is a community of values.
We hear that ad nauseam.
Internal correction mechanisms are not particularly effective.
Mr President.
(Applause from the right)
The question deserves to be asked.
My own country too is criticised in this report.
It is about something much larger.
Opinion forming is important.
Let us not forget that.
These are by way of clarification.
It threatens to break up families.
Mention has already been made of the asylum issue.
The review framework and the review process already exist.
What crime has Mr Plantin committed?
He edited a journal.
A perfectly proper journal.
A journal that does no harm to anyone.
A serious, scientific journal.
This unacceptable situation must not be allowed to continue.
This is not an easy situation.
Mr Cornillet was himself a distinguished previous rapporteur.
You speak of rights and freedoms.
Violations in Italy continue to be very frequent.
We will discuss this matter another time, however.
Is it ambitious?
This weakens the basis of democracy.
The Convention should reflect upon these issues.
Data protection and transparency are included.
Rights to these must be developed in the Treaty.
The issue clearly needs to be explored further.
Mrs Swiebel has made this clear.
We must clearly develop our methods for the future.
We are not perfect.
Our young people travel throughout Europe.
They are two sides of the same coin.
That must be an absolutely basic requirement.
Certainly if I read paragraph 133.
That really is too ridiculous for words.
Is this a crime against human rights?
Mrs Swiebel has been very selective.
My second comment concerns conscientious objectors.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
On these things there is broad agreement.
I would like to single out five of them.
We can get down to work.
Firstly, in the legislative field.
The second objective is the training of border guards.
So much for the motion's real background.
The content of the motion is no less alarming.
How?
No answer.
What does the report have to say?
Not a word.
No thank you.
I agree with Mr Krarup on that.
I have high hopes of them.
Good night.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 9 p.m.)
Community railways
This is therefore an extremely pressing issue.
We must also deal with domestic transport.
We now come to the third proposed directive.
Why have we tabled amendments?
And we need a high level of safety.
I hope that the Commission agrees.
I hope that you will support us in this.
The safety situation is satisfactory at the moment.
Firstly, a structure.
Who is responsible for what?
Everyone must know how things stand.
We must work on this.
It is an important point, however.
It is also more environmentally friendly and safer.
Safety standards vary across the European Union.
One question remains unresolved, namely funding.
Their skills and knowledge are valuable.
It also entails corporatism and national vote-winning measures.
There is a second way of addressing the problem.
There is a price to be paid for transport.
We must not ignore recent maritime disasters.
In my opinion, this is the Swiss way.
The European Union should of course direct this policy.
It is therefore essential that we adopt this approach.
This falls within the scope of the executive.
I will finish on that note.
This has also been mentioned once already today.
It cannot be stressed often enough.
Both aspects have been addressed often enough here today.
A 40-tonne heavy goods lorry is fully interoperable.
A freight train is not.
That is the difficulty that faces the industry.
It is not an easy problem to overcome.
Dilution of safety standards is not an option.
All of us here are supporters of railways.
They have done some excellent work.
The competitiveness of the railways has seriously decreased.
Mr Savary has also done good work.
Firstly that of safety in the Sterckx report.
These developments have had disastrous consequences.
Our leaders are out of touch with reality.
Many Maoists have in fact been reincarnated as environmentalists.
The only thing that was important was volume.
Bureaucratic obstacles must be eliminated as far as possible.
We are building it with these directives.
I voted against the first rail package also.
It has not even been fully implemented.
The market and safety issues are however clearly incompatible.
I am for cooperation between different rail networks.
Mr Jarzembowski was also talking about a balanced relationship.
We endorse that.
An article in this morning's newspaper.
Back to square one.
There is nothing wrong with that.
Foresight is the essence of government.
This document contains two groundbreaking proposals.
Rail transport should be an integrated European public service.
I believe that this was completely the wrong attitude.
We are responsible to Europe's citizens.
That is what we have to realise.
We are not talking about privatising the rail network.
I believe that that is the important point.
We do not therefore accept Amendment No 56.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
This proposal repeals and replaces the Regulation of 1985.
We had a number of preliminary discussions together.
We have therefore tabled Amendments Nos 105 and 106.
We have therefore tabled Amendment No 107.
Paying drivers on a piecework basis is quite unjustifiable.
With 300 amendments the work was not easy.
This was a challenge for us.
We wanted to build in flexibility.
We have also introduced flexibility to the breaks.
Nevertheless, we should not exaggerate this either.
Some statistics show the risk to be very high.
Thank you for your attention.
It read: fresh goods need fresh drivers.
We recently experienced the Prestige disaster.
Road safety is an important matter.
The Commission proposal, however, was badly drafted.
The new regulation will not improve road safety either.
They should be ashamed of themselves.
What then is to be done?
That is only the driving time.
On top of that there is loading and unloading.
In addition, systematic inspections need to be introduced.
Changes would have far-reaching consequences for the sector.
Two starting points are crucial here.
A clear definition must be found for these elements.
My thanks to the rapporteur for his work.
The fundamental axis of this report is road safety.
That is something we must do something about.
We think that this is an important safety issue.
This is simply not acceptable.
I will therefore be voting against this regulation.
What is the reasoning behind this?
Anything else just causes bad feeling towards Europe.
That is not my competence.
I am talking about road safety.
That is the objective of this proposal.
The changes therefore have to be incorporated.
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Before the vote:
My group opposes the oral amendments.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Before the vote on Amendment No 91:
However, it is for the President to decide.
Your point does not therefore hold.
- -
Before the vote on Amendment No 18:
It is an issue of crucial importance.
Some of these companies come from outside the EU.
It was an animated, very convivial game.
This is why we voted against the Jarzembowski report.
I will vote against both these measures.
Let us go for rail rather than for lorries!
.
This proposal for complete liberalisation is very premature.
This is why I voted against it.
Now, Mr Sterckx was dressed as a cyclist.
Why was that?
Who knows!
.
Private interests will be concerned with maximising their profits.
I therefore voted against them.
We therefore abstained from the vote on this report.
I must congratulate Mrs Ainardi on her excellent work.
Well then, my proposal is as follows.
.
.
.
.
Decisions on safety are usually preceded by fatal accidents.
We were happy to vote for the Markov report.
The Convention has been rather silent on this point.
There are some points I regret.
This is not a satisfactory situation.
I therefore voted for the motion.
That is why I abstained.
What we ask is why Malta and not Galicia?
Why Cyprus and not Scotland?
.
We have therefore voted against this report.
The Member States are not homogenous.
They range from federal states to centralised unitary states.
.
.
I accordingly voted against the report.
I have voted in favour of this report.
The Minutes of Monday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
I find this interpretation to be somewhat offensive.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
Working in this direction is not our only responsibility.
The next two years will be crucial here.
This will help to consolidate social solidarity and cohesion.
And we need to act in two directions.
The future of Europe.
We hope not.
We want peace.
Iraq has to respect and apply Security Council resolutions.
(Applause)
First, the status of MEPs.
The success of the presidency depends on it.
The success of the European Union depends on it.
(Applause)
This was clear throughout your speech.
We must not be discouraged by these challenges.
The Lisbon process is already starting to bear fruit.
Progress has not been uniform throughout Europe, however.
We will make a good team.
We have made it our priority for this year.
A startling figure.
Clearly, we must invest in the future.
Governments themselves must also help, of course.
Let me move on to the Lisbon process.
Appalling things are currently happening in Chechnya.
(Applause)
Firstly, enlargement.
And you have also mentioned some other important challenges.
Firstly, a reunified Cyprus.
We are counting on your intelligence and flexibility.
Secondly, the Lisbon Strategy.
This is one of the Greek Presidency's responsibilities.
I would also address the President of the Commission.
I wish you lots of luck.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
That is something we would do very well.
There must be no war with Iraq.
Be bold enough to do it!
Let us begin with the Iraqi crisis.
No proof at all.
I do not, therefore, understand this strategy.
We said 'yes'.
We must tell the Security Council this.
These indicators must be equal.
You spoke of maritime safety - fine!
Who will pay for the Erika?
Who will pay for the Prestige?
That is scandalous!
Lastly, you spoke of Cyprus.
Naturally, you want a united Cyprus.
Thank you Mr President.
Greece was the cradle of democracy.
This is our advice.
Open up all meetings in which you debate laws.
Make all the minutes from meetings available.
Prepare complete registers of correspondence in the Council.
Things have, however, gone the opposite way.
There is barely any eye contact anymore.
The two-state solution must really be carried through now.
I have seen them with my own eyes.
No one expects any miracles.
But they do expect the right approach.
Would it impose the designation of ports of refuge?
I shall stop the list there, Mr President.
This is the opposite of sustainable development.
There is also a need for annual progress reports.
Sittings come and go.
So do programmes.
Cultivable land will increase by 55%.
An excellent move.
Today you announced this in an ambitious voice.
Cooperation is not enough.
We need a long-term policy.
I wish you every success.
May I wish you every success.
These creative prospects cannot be reversed.
He managed to avert that war.
Members have raised very interesting points.
We look forward to working closely with you.
In Greece, demonstrations are almost a daily occurrence.
Obviously our group agrees with this.
Mr Trakatellis made some very important points on this.
This has been a most useful debate.
I believe that this is the way to go.
You all know that I never exaggerate.
I can assure you: we are lost.
Such are the market forces on both sides.
I can give you another figure.
We are deluding ourselves.
My response to the second question is this.
That concludes the item.
Part I
President.
I would be happy to do so.
That is not possible.
Supplementary questions must be just that; supplementary questions.
Subject: Humanitarian crisis in Angola
This is funded by ECHO and by EDF funds.
De-mining is also important.
It is difficult to say what is most important.
In cases like this almost everything is important.
This is extremely high on the agenda.
It is therefore enormously urgent to accelerate that effort.
Angola is more than diamonds and oil.
Subject: Recent maritime disasters
Commissioner, thank you for your response.
Would the Commission consider setting up a study?
Copenhagen speaks of specific measures.
We must coordinate the European response.
We must distinguish between these two situations.
It will therefore have to be up to scratch.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner de Palacio
Subject: Accusations of torture in Greece
Questions to Commissioner Liikanen
Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
It is a very, very serious matter.
I have two points to make to the President.
Only in this case.
I can then reply in that context.
Subject: Greece and SMEs
how to produce more entrepreneurs,
and
how to get more firms to grow.
The Paper identifies three pillars for action:
secondly, balancing the risks and reward of entrepreneurship;
and thirdly, a society that values entrepreneurship.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
Subject: Status of third-party certifiers in the EU
Questions to Commissioner Patten
Subject: CFSP: Future prospects for Kosova
Kosova needs a clearly autonomous statute.
We know that much has happened.
I have two points.
Subject: Status of Kosovo
That is an 'either/or' approach.
I just wanted to point that out.
Subject: Israeli military operations and lost EU funding
I should like to make two points.
Firstly, all of us condemn terrorist acts.
All of us condemn suicide bombing.
Subject: Voice of Europe
In its answer to Question H-0234/02
The Member concerned has powerful powers of persuasion.
There are great merits in opting for user-owned systems.
We cannot seriously accept this.
We support the rapporteur on three essential points.
Secondly, free, transparent competition.
You spoke of trust and security.
I do not understand why we should consult again.
Proper safeguards will be needed.
The American model is obviously an attractive template.
Yes, we have excessive costs.
We all want a level playing field.
Thank you very much, Mr Karas.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I should like to finish with the candidate countries.
But this is ultimately the responsibility of Member States.
Healthcare systems must face a triple challenge.
This will allow a balance between the three objectives.
Let us just be honest.
I am grateful to Mr Mantovani for his work.
These facts are not unrelated.
GATS threatens this.
Sharing information in these areas can only be beneficial.
That is a welcome move.
After all, age generally comes with ailments.
This proper attention and care involves people.
People who provide the necessary hands-on care.
The report furthermore disregards day-to-day practice.
In Europe we all have the same problem.
Why?
The Dutch citizen benefits from that too.
Why?
My reply is yes, a resounding yes.
Their joint platform demands a high-level retirement provision.
I have some concern about the climate of it.
I have never believed that.
I assume that this has simply escaped your notice.
Please stop talking about people being superannuated.
Let me make another comment.
I am very pleased about that.
Commissioner, I commend this matter to your care.
Some, quite wrongly, deny this.
The report emphasises prevention.
Thank you very much, Mr Karas.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.07 p.m.)
Afghanistan: one year after the Bonn Agreement
Much has since been achieved in Afghanistan.
The Commission will continue to play a leading role.
Success in 2003 will hinge on three key issues.
First, the need to improve internal security.
This is of critical importance for human rights .
It is far from that.
What is the situation today?
Tremendous steps have been taken.
It is not so today.
Why be so squeamish about tackling women's rights?
Is it because Afghanistan is an Islamic society?
When will this duplicity end?
Is this rhetoric or sentimentality?
No.
We must therefore carry out investigations for UNAMA.
Regrettably this is still happening.
This must come to an end.
This must not be allowed to continue.
This must not be allowed to happen.
The warlords and the Taliban were never our allies.
I remember Bonn just over a year ago.
They are saying the same thing in Afghanistan.
It is all very vague.
But it is something we must press for.
Women's rights are revealing.
The reality is, however, rather different.
This must stop.
A certain amount has been done about this.
What is this about, first and foremost?
Why am I giving you this background information?
Have women been forgotten again?
Others are international law and human rights.
What has become of their rights?
What legal system do they come under?
None at all.
I think these double standards are causing us problems.
Why is it so difficult to bring about change?
Men with piercing eyes scowling at women.
Are there any solutions?
Yes.
This is only one of many examples.
Mr President, we must not forget Afghanistan.
They can be won over - but by anyone.
In due course these people must go home.
The international community should take note of this.
Much still needs to be done.
That is the highest rate recorded worldwide.
The education system had collapsed utterly.
Let us take a look into the future.
This is somewhere else where we must help.
Well done!
Mr Morillon and Mr Sakellariou said likewise.
All this is true.
They do have a difficult job.
I will certainly pass on the commendation of Members.
There are no quick fixes in Afghanistan.
We have to go on repeating that.
We strongly support this initiative.
So we are aware of these concerns.
All of them gave rise to controversy.
We did.
The cosmetics industry is not entirely blameless in this.
I also want to thank the Danish presidency.
It sticks.
There are practical steps now to be taken.
I agree with that criticism.
I think we could have made faster progress.
We Greens have campaigned hard for this.
The victory is yours, Mrs Roth-Behrendt - congratulations!
It looked very difficult at the beginning.
The second major result concerned ourselves as consumers.
You are needed.
Firstly the abolition of animal testing in cosmetics.
The third point concerns allergens.
Some cosmetics still contain allergens.
So we have also won on that point.
Cosmetics have proved their safety.
There is no such ban, however.
In future we will think of European legislation.
It has been a long gestation period.
It sets the target dates to end that marketing.
Congratulations are in order for that.
I am wholly in favour of it.
I therefore wholeheartedly endorse this compromise.
Such a grandmother would be done for!
I love cosmetics.
This is something we must do together.
Anyway, we will give it a try.
Thank you, rapporteur.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The sitting is suspended until 12 noon.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament rejected the motion for resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
Before the vote on Amendment No 23:
Could my colleagues help me here?
I think we have lost the page.
We have lost a whole page.
It is OK.
We will catch up.
(Laughter and applause)
(Laughter and applause)
Before the vote on Amendment No 24:
I have checked in the other versions.
We will ensure that all language versions are compatible.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I agree with you entirely.
That concludes the vote
.
.
The British Conservatives will therefore vote against this resolution.
.
Why did I vote for the report?
.
.
That is why I voted against this report.
A number of factual inaccuracies have therefore crept in.
Any allegations are rigorously investigated and prosecutions sought.
They also have access to legal redress if appropriate.
Item 23:
Our view is that prostitution is always forced.
Item 67:
Item 133:
.
We therefore voted against.
.
No country is spared!
.
.
.
.
Hence our vote in favour of the report.
.
For example:
1.
However, the three facts are omitted:
2.
Conscientious objectors:
.
Minors are being used as child soldiers.
.
.
I have voted against the report.
It is the first step.
.
This would be a useful outlet for European solidarity.
.
But why?
Against whom and against what?
Naturally, we voted against this report.
.
combat illegal immigration.
.
.
(FR) Europe has abolished internal borders.
We can move freely.
Security is no longer guaranteed.
I therefore reject this proposal.
.
.
.
.
.
This is something with which we disagree.
The report is thoughtful and well-considered.
They put down roots in such communities.
The questions are financial.
The questions are also professional.
Useful and essential community services cost money.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Members voting - 535;
Blank or spoiled ballots - 26;
Votes cast - 509
Absolute majority - 255.
I therefore declare him to be the European Ombudsman.
One point I would like to make is this.
I offer Professor Diamandouros all my congratulations.
Thank you for your comments, Mr Perry.
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mrs Thors.
Your comments have been noted.
This is a mistake.
(The Minutes were approved)
Let us be Mediterranean partners for peace!
There are also many other associated problems.
These communities are represented at institutional level.
Lebanon is a key partner in the Euro-Mediterranean structure.
The country has experienced a terrible civil war.
Its economic strategy is already liberal.
World Trade Organisation membership has been requested.
I commend this agreement most warmly to Parliament.
In my eyes, that is not enough.
Secondly we must ask: which policies?
There are extensive infringements of human rights.
There are also a dozen in Israel.
The situation concerning these refugees must be clarified.
Lebanon must also ratify the Geneva Convention.
This must take place through a dialogue between equals.
The debt is USD 30 billion.
There is glaring inequality.
This European unease will not upset Hezbollah.
The party of Allah is simply not mentioned.
How does the Council view that?
That is the paradox we face today.
Is there a need for an association?
Unfortunately that is still in doubt.
It has already made a number of moves.
Thank you for your comment, Mr Brok.
The Commission will have several new members in 2004.
Our job is to encourage and assist them.
Health and social issues usually go hand in hand.
It has yet to see the light of day.
That ought to have happened a long time ago.
I hope I am wrong.
I urge the Commissioner to involve this House fully.
Many thanks for that.
Why is that?
One cannot merely rely on gas imported from Russia.
The Baltic Ring must be involved in the programme.
The project is like a patchwork quilt.
I would like to say something about border management.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is something we must avoid come what may.
My third point is the main one: disarmament.
I just wanted to point that out.
It is an economic area that must be developed.
These are a necessity.
The following questions are addressed to the Council
The Erika accident took place on 19 December 1999.
What would be the consequences for your islands?
We need the Council to act more quickly.
A natural disaster is clearly something quite different.
This is a linguistic question.
In any event, it is a supplementary question.
If the President-in-Office wishes to give his opinion ...
Additional measures therefore need to be adopted.
Next, we should surely amend all international legislation.
Subject: Recent maritime disasters
The Commission presented its proposal on 19 December.
Citizens are sometimes disillusioned with the EU.
Will he defend this in the Council?
Does he support it or not?
I would like a clear answer on this point.
Perhaps I did not make my position perfectly clear.
Thank you for your reply.
My question to you is this:
Subject: Procedural safeguards for defendants in criminal proceedings
Thank you.
The Minister is right.
Subject: Police academy and EU border protection
Subject: Initiatives in favour of SMEs
Subject: Date for the accession of new Member States
We would have hoped for something different.
Subject: Intensification of preparations for war against Iraq
What has to be done?
Iraq has to be taught a lesson and disarmed!
Is this our peace effort?
This is not in fact a question.
You did exactly the same earlier.
You are Greek!
Souda is in Greece!
Subject: Human rights situation in the Chechen Republic
Subject: Situation in Chechnya
You made a very long statement.
The Russians do not want anyone in the region.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(The sitting was closed at 7 p.m.)

EBRD activities
Secondly, it has implemented a policy of conditionality.
This is particularly evident in the Board of Governors.
The first comment relates to the institution itself.
What is the basic element binding them?
I think that there are two types.
That is a commitment for everyone.
The EBRD has a political mandate.
We are maintaining a strong commitment in Central Europe.
Why?
I would just like to make two specific comments.
My second comment concerns the environment.
There is a great deal to be done.
We see this as a fundamental activity.
My last comment concerns relations with the European Union.
That is not all.
Their success is vitally important to us all.
As you are aware, such practices exist elsewhere.
Human rights must always be guaranteed.
Mr Purvis mentioned the Balkans and Serbia.
I wonder therefore what the Greens have against it.
Are there not risks of contradiction there?
This brings me to my points of criticism.
There are certainly no opportunities for local economic development.
This House has therefore opposed any such investment.
Our two hands need to work in harmony.
The balance-sheet is impressive.
Secondly, I endorse your priorities.
We must not spread ourselves too thinly.
We cannot adopt divergent priorities.
I believe that the following points are important.
We will support you in this approach.
How can we facilitate economic growth through investment?
Think of the Chernobyl disaster.
The present situation is completely unacceptable.
This bank takes an ethical approach to credit management.
The first is in response to Mr Blak.
We are not content with self-examination.
My second comment is addressed to Mrs SchrÃ¶der.
A simple yes or no will suffice.
No.
The answer is no.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Is this utopian thinking?
We shall see.
They are not polluters.
Rather, they are the victims of pollution.
What can be done in the short term?
The Commissioner has replied to me on this subject.
This report will be adopted in very sad circumstances.
The study will encompass all these issues.
Due consideration will be given even to the smallest.
They will require detailed study.
Sea bream and bass are two current examples.
All this is dealt with in the communication.
This is contained in Paragraph 28.
But it will not.
Aquaculture gives rise to many problems.
GMOs are an issue that has been raised already.
Many other jobs complement traditional fishing practices.
The aquaculture sector has been hit particularly hard.
Aquaculture is an emerging sector within Community fisheries.
Consequently, it faces many challenges and uncertainties.
We gained an understanding of the marketing problems too.
Aquaculture is a fisheries sector with great potential.
I do have a couple of comments, however.
Self-help is better.
This market must be put on the right track.
Regulation must be simple, clear and honest.
It must always be possible to guarantee food safety.
Let us keep both feet on the ground.
I therefore call for simple regulation.
Aquaculture has a promising future.
This is a new option.
It must be complementary to other types of fishing.
Aquaculture is not dangerous.
I do not think so.
Stocks are continuing to decline.
However, it is not a panacea.
It is worth looking more closely.
There are still many unresolved problems in aquaculture.
This report reflects the growing importance of this sector.
However, these proposals relate mainly to technical matters.
I will vote accordingly this afternoon.
There are approximately 150 Community regulations on aquaculture.
The food conversion rate of farmed fish is low.
Certainly, fish are used to feed other fish.
Hence, the need for research.
In future, aquaculture is bound to grow.
We have therefore reached good common ground.
Congratulations, Mr Martin.
Sustainable development has to be the watchword.
The most recent has been unfair competition.
We must make sure that these unfair practices stop.
We have obviously achieved this.
Fish farming offers prospects for the disadvantaged regions.
Galicia is a case in point.
The future will not be all plain sailing.
Greater vigilance is required, as are technological improvements.
More specific provision for research is called for.
He was a kind and generous native of Galicia.
He loved his region and he loved the sea.
We therefore do not support this verbal amendment.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Regarding Amendment No 6:
That is the oral amendment.
Lebanon is just a stone's throw away.
We have therefore rejected this report.
The EBRD is not connected with the European Union.
Hugues Martin report (A5-0448/2002)
This change is not without risks.
That concludes voting time.
This represents 41 000 jobs for the Union.
It was EUR 276 million in 2000.
This equalled 28% of the total CFP budget.
A political strategy is lacking too.
Fishing is not entirely to blame.
Spillage from oil tankers also plays a part.
No effective action has yet been taken against them.
Global climate change is another contributory factor.
These inevitably end up in the sea.
The communication explains how we have taken the initiative.
They should have greater weight in future cooperative ventures.
This will probably not result in vessels being scrapped.
I commend this report to the House.
We must seek responsible and sustainable fisheries everywhere.
The ELDR amendments address these developmental and financial concerns.
We cannot continue to export our problems.
This is not just a Spanish problem.
I support what Mrs Attwooll has said.
The report is very defensive in tone.
Let us remind ourselves of what those wrongs are.
That is why we should reject this report.
The indigenous supply cannot meet European demand.
However, long-term public subsidies conflict with this goal.
This applies especially to international waters.
Controls alone are not sufficient.
The sanctions must not simply be tokenist.
The debate is closed.
Cetaceans are a sensitive part of marine life.
We therefore have to keep abreast of developments.
Economic interests are clearly linked to the issue.
I look forward very much to your response.
The debate is closed.
The question is whether this is enough.
I would appreciate confirmation of this from the Commission.
Pyongyang has long tried to deny this awful reality.
The Council fully shares this view.
The aid is granted impartially.
The debate is closed.
The secretary-general of the largest opposition party was arrested.
This political abuse cannot be tolerated.
Democratisation is a necessary precondition for effectively counteracting poverty.
Many African countries mess things up themselves.
Those poor people.
I therefore recommend a measured approach.
Simply imposing sanctions is not a solution.
The United States are going to reopen their Embassy.
Why?
For oil.
Let us reopen our office.
Why?
For human rights and democracy.
They obviously cannot be described as democratic elections.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
We also protest against that.
We do not know by whom.
No ransom has been demanded.
They did not need a white list.
Indifference makes us accomplices.
80 000 people have died in Chechnya since 1999.
Hundreds of thousands have been made refugees.
The situation in Chechnya is bad.
Let us acknowledge that.
Various fellow MEPs have already pointed this out.
There is a real guerrilla war in progress.
The OSCE is being removed from Chechnya.
The Russians evidently do not want any busybodies there.
Nevertheless, the present resolution is very balanced.
This is a hopeful sign towards democracy and self-determination.
However, I have a fundamental question.
Please do not make such comparisons again.
It was a scandal.
We are supposed to have a partnership with Russia.
I believe that double standards should be avoided.
These are not terrorist attacks.
We have completely lost the plot.
We are combining everything under the heading of terrorism.
It is time that Parliament woke up.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
We have reached the end of the agenda.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 5.05 p.m.)
.
Resumption of the session
I note your upset with regard to your assistant.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
Mr Solana, I apologise for interrupting your introduction.
Colleagues, I think you have made your point.
(Applause from the right)
(Applause)
The first is undoubtedly Iraq.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Firstly, the low turn-out.
It is the lowest turn-out since the 1967 elections.
That is the first point to stress.
We must analyse why this situation has come about.
It will primarily be their job to do this.
It is difficult.
Force is the last resort.
Diplomacy must always be our method.
(Applause)
Plainly, not everything has gone so well.
How can we deal with these problems?
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Laughter and Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause from the centre and the right)
Simply opening doors is not enough.
What became of the 8 500 litres of it?
(Applause)
Why?
War is not inevitable.
It was very interesting.
Why did he not do so before?
Do we have measures to deal with it?
Has the UN considered this?
Will such meetings become regular events?
Dr Blix raises many disturbing questions in his report.
Saddam Hussein clearly has a case to answer.
And I invite them to search their consciences.
This does not merit such rejoicing.
Beware of playing down war!
Beware of gradually and insidiously accepting the unacceptable!
He does not deserve congratulations, Mr Solana.
We must listen to public opinion.
(Applause)
There is an overwhelming majority against war in Germany.
Calm down!
(Applause)
There will be more than thirty of us.
We must not let them down!
(Applause)
Personally, I would like to make a suggestion.
Obviously nobody here today is defending a dictator.
What did we do?
Who intervened to stop this bloodletting?
Nobody!
Nobody intervened!
So, let us stay calm.
There is a problem, however.
Iran now possesses missiles.
Iran is currently equipping itself with a nuclear arsenal.
Is anyone suggesting a military foray into Iran?
Obviously not!
That would be too dangerous.
Is anyone suggesting military intervention?
Of course not!
That would be too dangerous.
That is the truth.
That is why we must step back.
So we have time.
We can wait a year.
Let us change the agenda and our priorities.
Let us change the agenda.
(Applause)
Political torment plagued Europe in the last century.
They certainly did not spare their own citizens.
In fact the opposite is true.
The warmonger is Bush, the democrat.
Please, let us not be hypocritical!
Let us stop acting out humanitarian indignation.
What form is political reconstruction to take?
This means that any resolution becomes obsolete extremely quickly.
The Greek Presidency shares this ambition.
It is no easy task.
What should be done with Saddam Hussein?
Iraq must pull itself together.
I would advise strongly against making this journey.
Who was it really that created Saddam Hussein?
Is that within the bounds of possibility?
We also have another task.
President Bush believes in absolute good and absolute evil.
I, for my part, do not.
Of course Iraq must comply with the UN resolutions.
That would be a far-sighted and long-term solution.
What will Europe propose?
That is his opinion!
I can see some logic in all this.
We radicals have presented a proposal.
What are we suggesting?
What proposal are we now submitting to you too?
They have not yet seen any convincing evidence.
The gap will grow.
The international coalition against international terrorism is being undermined.
Europeans are not at all convinced.
We reject the logic of inevitable war.
We have the time, Saddam does not.
That is true wisdom.
Mr President, resolution 1441 is very clear.
I turn to weapons of mass destruction.
What are the consequences?
Millions of refugees.
The reasons have already been partly cited.
We also have our share of responsibility, however.
The embargo is helping the dictatorship.
It is killing the Iraqi people.
We all know what those prisoners are suffering.
Make no mistake, this war is about oil.
The European Union is footing that particular bill.
Society in Afghanistan remains as fractured as ever.
So much for democracy.
Truly a war of civilisations.
May God helps us all!
Once again, nothing surprises us any more.
Yes to the peaceful resolution of international problems.
I think that is very sad.
It is not the other way round.
That is the choice.
The chemical and biological conventions could also be strengthened.
There are many other proposals.
The same applies to nerve gas.
The report continues in this vein.
The pressure on Saddam Hussein must be intensified.
This exploitation must be avoided at all costs.
Let me put another question.
Why only from 5 February onwards?
My third question is this.
So let her tell us what they are!
Let me put my last question.
(Applause)
It has been afraid since 11 September.
It has waged war on every continent.
Let America listen to her!
We know the Americans are the strongest.
We are forced to take note of it.
That is no reason to be unilateral.
What took place on Monday is not enough.
And what are we doing about it?
Let me ask you one simple question.
No.
And nobody listened to us.
Mr President, I am ashamed today!
Is it worth the cost?
Only the Security Council can make decisions on this.
The EU must protest strongly against this.
I am saying no to unilateral war.
War is a failure of politics.
We must give the inspectors more time.
Mr President, war is a grave thing.
We must give peace another chance.
Does this attitude show loyalty to the European Union?
Is this position which breaks European consensus loyal?
Thank you.
And for seven long weeks Resolution 1441 was debated.
We are therefore working in the right direction.
Will we achieve a good outcome?
Let us hope that it is for good.
I have received six motions for resolutions
The oil in Iraq changes nothing.
Developing nuclear weapons is not an effective defence policy.
And what are we doing?
Are we going to threaten war?
No!
I entirely agree with the motion for a resolution.
I would like to highlight three points from it.
Destabilising the Korean peninsula would have more far-reaching consequences.
Human suffering in North Korea is immense.
I have received six motions for resolutions
This approach will guarantee our credibility.
I do not think so.
I understand that that does in fact happen.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Secondly, the United States.
I would like to refer to three in particular.
The world is more evil than that.
It is extremely important to maintain that balance.
I have received six motions for resolutions
This is not a new problem we are discussing.
This became the subject of the aforementioned investigations.
How can this be so?
So I welcome this resolution and I commend it.
Fortunately, armed conflict in the region has ended.
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.
The United Nations bears a colossal responsibility for this.
Millions of citizens are living in appalling conditions.
We should not delude ourselves any longer.
The Congo has exceptional natural resources.
It is a veritable holocaust.
The right to defence must be preserved.
I also listened to the Africans there.
I certainly do not think the terminology was incorrect.
These are just some of the essential points.
Under expenditure is one of the most important.
The figure for 2001 was 16%.
Most recipients find the Regulations too complicated.
The fight against fraud must be strengthened too.
This would facilitate the work of the House.
I wish to express my sincerest thanks for that.
The situation is very alarming.
I therefore support this amendment.
In my opinion the report before us is excellent.
Major reforms were drawn up during that year.
Parliament therefore requires all necessary information.
Madam President, Commissioner, may I quote something?
End of quote.
So there is something intrinsically wrong with the system.
That is not good budgeting!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The big question is whether this is enough.
That is being left to the Member States.
What experience have we had since 1996?
There is clearly room for improvement.
What improvements do we want to see?
These figures are eloquent and require no further elucidation.
Let me, though, make one thing clear.
I must also extend these congratulations to Mr McCartin.
This is not acceptable.
The reform consists of two separate procedures.
In addition, a conciliation procedure was introduced.
The Conciliation Body has not been sufficiently effective either.
My group will therefore fully support the report.
We should heed it.
I therefore welcome the report wholeheartedly.
His approach ensured that the report was adopted unopposed.
This represents a considerable achievement.
The first is that of recovery.
Something is wrong here.
It is not working.
This is not right.
Politically speaking, that is just not on.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
.
It supplements the Directive on environmental information.
I therefore congratulate the Commissioner for the Environment.
Indeed, what is happening through this process?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
We should be satisfied with the end result.
In 2005 this directive will be reviewed.
This is not true.
.
Countries have undertaken to reach specific targets.
I recommend voting in favour of this report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.12 p.m.)
We would then transcend mere words.
The figures speak for themselves.
We are all aware of the alarming statistics.
Nonetheless, I believe they bear repetition.
Meanwhile, 900 people die of hunger every hour.
It is not a particularly ambitious target.
Hunger cannot wait.
A two-pronged approach is called for.
Two main courses of action can be identified.
I mean education for all, girls included.
I am not referring merely to the European Union.
They are essential and have to be taken.
There have been countless statistical reports.
Prevention is essential but it is not everything.
To use such blackmail on vulnerable people is shameful.
Who is the more guilty here?
Free trade is not fair trade.
The global economic recession is certainly taking its toll.
Economic decline hits poor countries hardest.
In short, a success story.
Protectionism.
We must therefore ask how we trade.
Europe is the biggest importer of food.
Then we shall see economies developing.
Who will take responsibility for it?
I do not refer simply to food aid.
How can we release them from this vicious circle?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Hypocrisy cannot be condoned though.
We can do more by helping those countries.
So we must look at the common agricultural policy.
The essence is the distribution problem.
With political dictatorships it is different.
Take Zimbabwe, for example.
Scarcer water resources also have an impact.
Increased large-scale irrigation is no longer possible.
Often it is mainly women who suffer from famine.
That must not be.
Behind theoretical speech there is a whole real world.
They are real people, not dummies.
They have a pain threshold.
This must not be forgotten.
We have a problem with consistency here.
Are we going to support him?
Mr President, I have almost finished.
This game is also going on in this House.
We all have a responsibility.
As I say, I share the analysis.
They do not get services as such.
It is another layer, so to speak.
This makes sense.
Unfortunately, I never even received an answer.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Nevertheless, I am pleased about this resolution.
I have two thoughts on the issue.
India has 65 million tonnes of grain available immediately.
They have one thing in common, however.
An important aspect is the Commission's own programme.
Coordination with other donors is emphasised.
Sixty years is a long time.
Nearly six million people have died.
So why the reference to poor countries?
There are calls to increase this amount.
Transparency plays a major role in this.
A win-win situation.
We are also seeing tuberculosis making a comeback.
I could continue with these statistics of misery indefinitely.
We carry some responsibility for that.
The speakers deserve your consideration.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
I vote against.
We will make a note of that.
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
It should not read 'Demokratiekomittee'.
That is an incorrect translation.
We will ensure that all language versions correspond.
Before the vote on paragraph 13:
I propose adding the following to item 16:
Thank you for drawing that to our attention.
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
Before the vote on paragraph 4:
Mr President, what an honour!
So might this be a report against the monarchy?
However, I forgot to add any sugar.
That coffee was so bitter!
.
.
This is another democratic deficit.
What colour would you like the gates?'
Hence my positive vote.
.
The snow was falling in large flakes.
'What a beautiful sight, a fairytale landscape!'
I said to myself.
.
.
.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
.
.
Firstly, clean water and sound nutrition.
This is a significant step forward.
.
.
.
.
I must, nevertheless, make some specific comments.
In fact the opposite is true.
.
They will need time for that.
That is surely right.
These are the three characteristics.
We say: 'Freedom for Iraq!
A free I-raq!'
But I wanted to focus on the Middle East.
.
.
.
.
But the resolution as a whole remains ambiguous.
This is why I abstained on this text.
Iraq is rich in petroleum.
Saddam Hussein is a cruel dictator.
.
.
It could only make a delicate situation worse.
We want to talk.
We want to negotiate.
This time we hope it will involve Parliament.
This offers a way forward for the future.
.
.
He prefers legal plundering.
And now, bon appÃ©tit!
.
.
This is a clear contradiction.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 12.20 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Are there any comments?
Subject to that observation, the Minutes are approved.
The following change has been proposed:
WEDNESDAY:
(Parliament agreed to the request)
Wonderful!
We can do that, Mr Leinen.
I hope he will be able to come.
Human damage cannot be repaired.
It is impossible to evaluate human suffering.
I believe this is entirely unacceptable.
I do not therefore accept this kind of argument.
That is why many of us went to Iraq.
No more using the UN to legalise force!
This crime can be avoided.
You said that those comments were not correct.
No, I will not do that.
What they put in as a quotation was correct.
No, it is not a point for plenary.
You may take it up with me privately.
That concludes the item.
We are very pleased to see you here.
Thank you for coming.
We need both.
This synthesis is difficult and painful.
We are drawing closer together.
We are becoming ever more dependent on each other.
When others are stricken, we are affected.
We need Europe to be stronger and more determined.
We have to do our homework for ourselves.
Europe has a vital interest in this issue.
Human rights must always be nurtured and promoted.
Europe can make a difference.
There is no need to shy away from this.
I will endeavour to go straight to the point.
Open up your markets ? trade means work.
We must respond.
We must be bolder.
Allow me to address a couple of issues.
Trade is important, of course.
It therefore represents hope.
I shall cite three examples.
We are part of the IMF.
The European Union is the best example of this.
There is certainly no way back.
The sea represents life itself.
These rights are what the economy is built on.
One way is participation in the UN Global Compact.
The theory is now belied by the facts.
I am sorry.
I believe that the response could be affirmative.
I shall not dwell on agricultural issues.
Commissioner Lamy has the floor once again.
The Union's position remains the same.
There must be no misunderstanding on this point.
This would simply be a non-restrictive opinion.
Discussions have begun again.
We must make progress.
Too many countries need to import low-cost medicines.
That is why we must seek innovative solutions.
This is an incredibly important issue.
Neither is an adequate solution.
This is inadequate!
Hence the regulation by the Council of Ministers.
Let us welcome your proposal of 7 January.
I wish you very good luck, Commissioner.
Unilateralism with a reason is just about comprehensible.
Unilateralism without any logic whatsoever is unforgivable.
It has still not been solved.
I am therefore well aware of the issues involved.
Ultimately the political breakthrough came.
That applies to all developing countries and all medicines.
So: this far and no further.
Not commerce.
Necessity knows no law.
The TRIPS agreements must not be a limiting factor.
Then there will be no development round!
That is why we are taking this clear stance.
Then new medicines will have to be developed.
That is my first point.
This will undercut the profits of legitimate pharmaceutical industries.
Is that something you see as likely, Commissioner?
That was not the intention at Doha.
I will now move on to my second point.
Please speak for the people of Europe.
We would be wasting our time.
This stance is not merely unfortunate.
Will it solve all our problems?
What about prevention and complete recovery?
What do we do then?
The European Parliament is firmly united on this issue.
This provisional arrangement is simply not enough however.
A long-term solution must therefore be found.
I have to say that I am completely baffled.
I just cannot understand its attitude.
This time the determination will be there.
We Europeans were isolated in the World Trade Organisation.
The Council is currently studying the proposal.
The quality of the health systems must be improved.
Problems of distribution and medical culture must be resolved.
Such rules may also relate to import procedures.
It has been tried and tested.
Allow me to emphasise that point again.
The Commission's stance on this issue is unequivocal.
Further, we wish to introduce some new provisions.
The Socialist Group would probably think not.
Something else enters into this, however.
And this is not always the case.
And our dependency stands at 75%.
This seems to me to be an extraordinary oversight.
There are good reasons for this.
However, this is clearly not the case.
The overwhelming bulk is traded locally or nationally.
Export subsidies are destroying the world market.
This protection must be transparent.
The United States wishes its agriculture to remain strong.
We must stand firm.
Developing countries cannot become shields concealing this aim.
I mean proper provision, not mere lip service.
They cannot be sidelined.
But let us call it as it is.
That was subsequently endorsed by the General Affairs Council.
What we need is public supervision and regulation.
We are talking about a social model for Europe.
We wholeheartedly endorse the concept of the Food Box.
Then there is the USA, of course.
This places us in an enormous dilemma.
You seem to be negotiating with a hawk Commissioner!
The subject of negotiations has also changed.
The present round does not concern goods.
It concerns knowledge.
Agriculture constitutes an exception to the rule.
It is nothing new.
There are moreover precedents for this.
There is the mysterious agreement of 2001 on bananas.
Chiquita collapsed just like Enron.
Our fears are also based on an unfathomable contradiction.
This is the basis of my fundamental fear.
We need an overall perspective on the matter.
This is no mean feat.
With enlargement on our doorstep we must act immediately.
It is a very difficult balancing act.
We have flexibility.
Let me conclude with a very brief question.
Perhaps you could say something about this.
No, thank you.
Specific proposals?
Yes, please'.
I am referring to Marrakech in 1995.
These matters form part of our negotiation mandate.
We shall pursue this, as previously agreed.
Our second principle concerns our work on these issues.
The Commission has indeed put forward a proposal.
This is not the case at the moment however.
You have already responded to this question I think.
I do not believe that we are.
They rightly pointed to the issue of food security.
This contrasts with the situation in other sectors.
This in itself is excellent news.
Mr Martinez is right on this point.
Goods are bought and sold.
This is not discussed.
In general it is poorly served by market forces.
Agriculture is therefore made up of two interdependent elements.
Mr President, I apologise for being late.
Only 36 000 people are receiving treatment in Africa.
The situation is therefore serious and urgent.
Hundreds of thousands of human lives are at risk.
Freedom of movement and residence for EU citizens
.
We feel this needs correcting.
That is not acceptable.
This directive is a step in the right direction.
This is now being simplified.
I find that rather far-fetched.
So let us keep it in perspective.
We have difficulty with long-term relationships, however.
I agree with this wholeheartedly.
Precisely what heritage does the Commission mean here?
That is really badly thought through.
This is our request.
We are not lawyers or barristers.
This is a welcome proposal.
Others have spoken about this.
It is great news for the cause of freedom.
How, today, do we define the family?
This is about national citizenship and EU citizenship.
Baroness Ludford is absolutely right.
There should be a principle of mutual recognition here.
They should not hinder anyone unnecessarily.
Imagine what it must feel like.
The rules must also be generous.
His answer does not address that issue.
That is the heart of the issue.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at midday.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (ARTICLE 120)
This is very much a step forward.
Madam President, this is just an opinion report.
We need clear rules which can be complied with.
Madam President, I thank the rapporteur.
I was saddened by what Mr Nassauer has said.
We have to move the debate forward.
It is an important and necessary report.
What is proposed would rectify this situation.
We can only regret the hypocrisy of European policies.
Yes, Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ is right.
The explanatory memorandum gives three reasons for it.
Where, however, is the difficulty?
We must be prudent.
This is the reason why immigration is so necessary.
On that we all agree.
We agree on that as well.
Thus far, we are all of one mind.
I recognise this is a difficult debate.
There is no right to immigration.
Immigration is only a possibility.
Our proposal states that very clearly.
That is a fundamental principle in our proposal.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
We congratulate the rapporteur.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
This is what our proposal is aimed at.
.
It could never replace a strategy by Belarus itself.
We demonstrably have a pariah state at our borders.
Belarus suffers from huge problems, of course.
This is of course unacceptable.
The forthcoming local elections are something to focus on.
Belarus under Lukashenko is far removed from that.
Belarus is increasingly cutting itself off.
Let us hope that some progress is made soon.
Until now we have used more stick than carrot.
There could be no peace under these conditions.
However, he is no Saddam Hussein.
We will want to pursue those points vigorously.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the vote.
Before the vote:
This will help European shipping considerably.
.
I shall respond directly to the point she made.
A second report is foreseen next year in 2004.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Before the vote on Amendment No 5:
Before the vote on Amendment No 3:
Amendment No 6 rests on that.
That does not help.
Is that correct?
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
.
'I?' replied Mr Santini.
'But you can move throughout Europe!'
.
.
On these grounds, we voted against this text.
.
.
Hence our vote in favour.
.
British Conservatives cannot, therefore, support this report.
.
.
Hence my vote against.
.
.
Visas are necessary and useful tools in providing controls.
British Conservatives cannot, therefore, accept this proposal.
.
.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
There are many other examples.
Quite the opposite.
When and where will they stop?
I am not sure.
Those are the risks and those are my doubts.
I shall abstain from voting on this agreement.
We have only to look at the Argentinean case.
This is a model of this sort of agreement.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
What should our strategy for transport be?
We have consulted the Ministers.
I have two urgent requests.
This is not the case.
It is an unacceptable simplification of the facts.
Now the governments must have their say.
This is where I disagree with Mr Vermeer.
Opinions can differ when it comes to the ecopoints.
They were an instrument.
That may well be so.
We are waiting, however!
We are waiting for a proposal from Europe.
Without an upper limit, it will not work.
Limited and transitional solutions are not what we want.
We want all those things, too.
Railways are not being used to their fullest capacity.
This report epitomises European transport policy.
No time vacuum should arise as regards this protection.
Mr President, I cannot understand my Austrian colleagues.
They are even worse off.
What you are after is special treatment!
In no way can you justify that!
Ladies and gentlemen, that is intolerable.
That has to be weighed in the balance.
You kept on wanting cross-subsidies.
Those are the facts of the matter.
I invite them to reflect on this.
I urge you strongly to think about that.
What is this about?
These are not tall stories.
I have had such conversations.
We will make no progress at all!
That amounts to an increase of 73%.
Secondly, the current situation is transitional.
That would also raise problems.
Those are the solutions.
We do not have many months.
I say this to everyone.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
This is a crucial and decisive time for transport.
And therefore competitiveness is being seriously harmed.
Safety cannot be conditional.
Also by the Council.
Alright.
It should therefore also be discussed by this Parliament.
I believe we are working in the same spirit.
We have progressed from realisation to warnings.
Now we must act.
We will resume it at 9 p.m.
Commissioner Schreyer has the floor.
We propose that this be left unchanged.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
We will follow the so-called catch the eye procedure.
Is this correct?
Where, in fact, does the Commission stand?
This is again stated in the Copenhagen resolutions.
I think this is something we have to respect.
Now for my second question.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I
Subject: Implications of tobacco advertising for Community competition policy
.
The Commission is following developments extremely closely.
Subject: The MEDA Programme and women
Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Solbes
Subject: Updated stability programme for Greece (2002)
My reply will be very quick.
A similar transfer was made the previous year.
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
I would thank the Commissioner for that answer.
The problem you raise goes a step further.
The fall in coffee prices is indeed catastrophic.
What is the cause of this collapse?
What can we do?
It is a complex, multi-faceted issue.
Subject: Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)
We must therefore change this.
Would you consider renaming?
Is development the objective of these negotiations?
Questions to Commissioner Diamantopoulou
They did not lead to an agreement.
I have three supplementary questions.
It will need some backing up.
I believe we shall achieve the necessary qualified majority.
That happens from time to time.
It is a question of credibility for us.
They are therefore fully informed of this.
Everything took place transparently.
No, of course not.
This is not a change.
It in no way alters the preferences.
Exemptions from the principle of non-discrimination are possible.
The following conclusions are very important in this respect.
It simply does not make sense.
That is the view taken by Confederation itself.
I can even quote figures to support this:
That represents an increase of 4 million people.
I am intrigued by your replies, Commissioner.
We are talking about thousands of jobs.
The reason for its review is your directive.
Subject: The demographic challenge, families and work
There are two parts to this problem.
This will do a great deal to help families.
This would have two impacts.
My recommendation would provide a quick solution.
The figures are indeed worrying.
With reference to Directive 2002/73/EC
It envisages specific policy measures.
A supplementary question.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We must be realistic, however.
That is very disappointing.
First, the agency.
I did not envy the rapporteur.
More and more people are now experiencing the drawbacks.
So it is time to choose.
Are we really making a choice?
This overcapacity could also lead to more intense competition.
It is a sectoral approach.
I cannot agree with that at all.
Final point: pricing.
A key feature of EU transport policy is durability.
Its implementation seems less easy.
Here too we hear arguments that this is undesirable.
With some good and some not so good points.
I therefore commend our amendments to our fellow MEPs.
Thirdly, we need to strengthen short sea shipping.
Fifthly, road safety.
Of course we need heavy goods vehicles too.
Finally, let me address the issue of cross-financing.
I would like to mention one final detail.
The report does not mention non-transport.
But let us not have yet another agency!
As it is we have too few resources here.
I should like to stress two points today.
Better late than never.
The White Paper makes plans for 2010.
The Commission must move in this area.
This is a missed opportunity.
That is important.
It is important to create TEN corridors.
There are advantages to backing trans-European networks.
I nonetheless have a number of points to make.
We must improve road safety in the EU.
I hope that it will be in place soon.
This is certainly a profitable business for these companies.
That is why the Union needs resources.
It needs money.
Naturally, that is out of date today.
We could probably do more.
Lastly, the third aspect: our regions.
In a short time she has got things moving.
That is one of our group's concerns.
Combining roads with other modes of transport is essential.
One such example is the idea of infrastructure charging.
This is certainly the case in the United Kingdom.
Similarly, enlargement will also generate additional road transport.
Infrastructure upgrading in candidate countries will require massive investment.
In aviation, I fully support the SKY initiative.
This programme established the single European area of research.
Firstly, the road safety agency.
I believe that this sentence is fundamental.
We must insist on strengthening the railways.
Paragraph 36 and others refer to this aspect.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
This is actually rather a sad moment.
Only then will we be acting progressively.
It is highly complex.
Bravo to the Commission that it has actually arrived.
The first models are ready.
It can exist.
This number of licences is sufficient.
Market forces must be allowed to take effect.
It is the result of auctions and general uncertainty.
They are being left outside the information society.
The network has also become a political implement.
.
Cut red tape, especially for self-employed people.
Establish easy and affordable access to legal advice.
Encourage cross-border trade to ensure a European e-economy.
That is very important.
.
Scientific findings need to be made broadly available.
Inclusiveness is an overriding principle in eEurope 2005.
It is vital to ensure an inclusive information society.
Thank you Commissioner.
It will be better for the Chairman too.
The mobile communications industry is in a bad way.
What is important about this proposal?
We want that exemption to continue.
It clarifies Parliament's position.
I hope this will be supported.
All of that is to be commended.
Mrs Auroi had a very difficult task.
I congratulate her.
This brings me to my second point.
There is provision for this in the exceptions.
Because the question is, what is reasonable?
Subsidiarity in this case is fundamentally wrong.
Turning now to 3G.
Intervention may however be necessary to guarantee competition.
This has happened too little to date.
More realistic targets should be set.
That is democracy.
This democracy must be promoted through public investment.
That is the importance of third generation.
Let us not underestimate it.
That is what will be successful in third generation.
That is what will power the knowledge economy.
This progress does also provide opportunities for development.
Who will be able to offer these services?
Perhaps the very air we breathe?
This comes at a very important time.
For two reasons.
You can tell me individually another time.
I very much support what Mr Paasilinna said.
Public documents must be made available in electronic form.
Basic information must be free of charge.
What happens?
Nothing.
Click again.
What happens?
Nothing.
You would actually be doing voters a service.
They could also get the search functions to work.
What do we need?
We need more competition in the postal services sector.
That is a very wise decision.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
I congratulate Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ on her work.
Another major issue is employment and social cohesion.
Our priority is to streamline the Employment Strategy.
I welcome Mr Vladimir Lukin and his colleagues.
.
There is a prevailing sense of insecurity.
No one can predict the consequences of a conflict.
This is a problem which affects us all directly.
At such times, trust is won or lost.
This too is a goal we ourselves set.
There is no leeway.
(Applause)
Therein lies the main problem.
Mr President, the knowledge-based economy is key.
That is disastrous in a sector like this.
We need it.
Our Europe does not deserve that.
So what do we see?
The United States are accumulating other deficits.
Now we have dropped that figure to 2.3%.
The truth is that progress has been disappointing.
The answer is no.
Who is discussing energy tax reforms?
And so on, and so on.
However, we need better indicators, et cetera.
Unemployment within the Union stands at 8.5%.
We have still not received a reply.
We demand equality - neither more, nor less.
All the political groups should be represented.
Lisbon is certainly very much about competitiveness.
It is very much about jobs.
They are the long-term unemployed of tomorrow.
We need to look at this clearly.
So there is a win-win situation.
I want to echo what Mrs Randzio-Plath just said.
That is what we must do.
Where is the evaluation?
I think that there are two reasons for this.
The first is to do with Lisbon itself.
It does not.
This has also been pointed out enough times.
They are negative.
The Commission itself did not look into that.
I think that that is very important.
Can an end not be put to this?
We are lagging behind in this field.
Others are doing poorly.
This is a crisis across Europe.
Some countries do well in clustering.
If anything, they will make it worse.
Why am I worried?
Because many pensioners are worried and cannot sleep either.
The process needs to be better coordinated.
It is therefore important that this balance be maintained.
This affects the whole area.
Even more redundancies?
Even more damage to the environment?
Most Members add further dimensions.
We do not need any more fine-sounding declarations.
That is quite right.
This optimism is sorely needed.
We must stop apportioning blame.
We need definite targets rather than woolly statements.
It is not simple.
This question demands an answer, and soon.
Wonderful papers are produced on active ageing.
At worst, it has not made any headway.
Clearly, it is developing and progressing too slowly.
Will they too be left out of the equation?
I think an answer is required.
In all events, a clear answer is required.
About funding the development of the so-called third sector?
Or has all this now been forgotten?
On top of that there is also cyclical unemployment.
That was very difficult.
There is not more new Europe than old Europe.
There is quite simply no Europe at all.
So spot the mistake!
That is undoubtedly what is happening with the euro.
Let me explain myself.
And that is very, very important.
Otherwise we shall achieve nothing.
No one objective takes precedence.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
.
But for the Chilean population?
.
.
.
.
.
Why?
Because it had the most points.
So points are helpful to Austria!
This is why I voted for the report.
.
They have convinced me finally.
.
.
.
.
'I am sure there will', I replied.
.
More specifically, such centralisation would cause several problems.
.
.
.
I therefore voted against the report.
The facts of the matter are very different.
.
.
We need it urgently!
Item 66:
Item 79:
Amendment No 26:
This proposal is far too detailed.
.
Consequently, we voted against this report.
.
That is not emphasised in the proposal.
.
.
.
.
Road safety is a very important responsibility.
.
We advocate the responsible liberalisation of European railway management.
We support the institutionalisation of a European Transport Fund.
Scientific research is continuing in this area.
Specialists are asking questions.
It is easy to see why.
.
For all?
For absolutely everybody?
What about pensioners?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
It should remain flexible and differentiated.
.
I therefore voted against it.
.
Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the votes.
The sitting is suspended
We hope it will not be the latter.
To underestimate them is to misinterpret history.
We need unity in the European Union.
And behind or alongside unity there is solidarity.
This is a moment of truth.
Humanitarian assistance has its own rationale and objectives.
This is a most serious situation.
It will not be our last.
It is the Iraqi dictator who is the problem.
(Applause)
(Applause from the right, heckling)
Then came the statement by the eight states.
(Applause from the centre and from the right)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
Before that there was nothing more than passivity.
This must be explained.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We trust that all governments will attend.
Let us keep it there.
Infant mortality has exploded in the last ten years.
It would be a humanitarian disaster.
What they told us makes good sense.
History has not yet been written.
The inspectors are the alternative to war.
(Applause)
Mr President, this is an exceptionally important debate.
Tensions are certainly rising in an international context.
This is the crux of the issue.
This is certainly a track record of brutal belligerence.
That person is Saddam Hussein.
And what does that mean, pray?
Peace for whom?
For the oppressed Iraqis?
There are many possibilities for this.
(Applause)
We are quarrelling with each other.
We are quarrelling with the United States.
Competition does not help in these circumstances.
Rather, cooperation is required.
The net is closing in on Saddam Hussein.
The world's patience is running out.
Resolution 1441 is crystal clear on that point.
Friday's report will therefore be very important.
The UN needs our support at this difficult time.
Good luck!
There is genuine desire for peace in Iraq.
Only legitimate defence can justify having recourse to arms.
Well, I would declare myself French and insensitive.
This francophobia is being cultivated alongside germanophobia.
(Applause)
(Applause)
These people are a threat to world security.
Their organisation strikes silently but with lethal impact.
That was humiliating, but was it inevitable?
It is not clear.
We must give the weapons inspectors more time.
There would be a danger of civil war.
We are still waiting.
Meanwhile, the Member States have taken positions.
What does that mean in terms of Iraq?
We do not!
Then our position would be a truly European one.
(Loud applause)
Iraq has, in practice, failed to comply.
Nonetheless, we must have a common policy.
That much is very clear.
Unlike Iraq, we are democracies.
We do not need more inspectors.
Mr Blix has confirmed that.
We need compliance by Saddam Hussein.
Where are those precursor chemicals, the munitions?
They are all serious questions.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
More pressure must be put on Iraq to cooperate.
We very much support that.
These two principles are inextricably linked.
We cannot take a unilateral approach to judicial assistance.
I do not see that such is the case.
I believe that this is really positive.
I do not understand what is going on here.
I do not understand.
Mr President, 1999 already seems ages ago.
At the moment there are 40 for every 100.
I agree essentially with her analysis of the situation.
It is quite frightening.
The criticism is justified.
Nor does a European constitution offer any added value.
Very good!
That is something I can only endorse.
So what is the situation today?
Commissioner Vitorino is thinking up something good.
What does the Council do?
It throws them in the waste-paper basket.
Such is the reality of the situation today.
Do not take what I say too personally.
That is wrong.
What are your demands, and what are ours?
Such, though, is not the case.
That was 20 years ago tomorrow.
In 2002, 634 politically motivated people were arrested.
This must be stated categorically.
In the Europe we are all now building together.
This is not for ideological reasons.
The Commission proposed the creation of a visa database.
We have the directive on temporary protection.
It has always given its opinions on time.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held on 11 March.
The second Convention is very explicit.
This is what my group is seeking.
These were guided bombs or cruise missiles.
That was the first aspect.
The subject speaks for itself.
And when it vaporises, most of it oxidises.
This would not be the first such action.
Exceptions may only be made for humanitarian reasons.
Widespread intervention in the concerned regions was not required.
The Commission closely follows the debates of both groups.
These are known as arrow shells.
They must also have heavy cores.
This is why depleted uranium is used.
I would like to say something about landmines.
For my final comment, I turn to disarmament.
I am not reassured on that point yet.
Thankfully we have done away with that.
This is extremely serious.
Is war without violation of human rights possible?
Anti-vehicle or anti-tank mines are a different matter.
It is wild scaremongering.
I will mention just three facts.
The facts are there.
There are weaknesses in those methodologies.
They are not right methodologies.
Thank you, Mr President.
The debate is closed.
There are two key issues which deserve special attention.
Firstly, comitology.
That is, EUR 18 million per year.
That is what is balanced and consolidated in 2002.
The Commission proposes EUR 13 million.
I believe we are obliged to do so.
This procedure will hopefully become automatic and natural.
For that I thank you sincerely.
The Council has a responsibility to take on here.
The forests themselves are also different.
Neither should we develop new institutions.
I believe there are various reasons for this.
Our forest heritage is gradually burning down and disappearing.
Sustainable forest management is becoming increasingly complex and technical.
Monitoring is actually the key word in this proposal.
Moreover, it was a safety policy.
I believe that this is a deplorable step backwards.
Why?
This is also an issue of ownership.
Where is the logic in this whole decision?
Neither plants nor animals survive.
Let us help to clean up the air.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
Of them, one woman dies.
All of this is obviously completely untrue.
Moreover, it has become a very balanced report.
It puts a lot of emphasis on education.
It puts a lot of emphasis on counselling.
That would be immoral.
I have been travelling extensively in Africa.
This is not trivial.
Mr President, we are discussing an important matter.
This programme is about the whole range of problems.
That did not make it easier.
The European Union must be generous.
I would like to raise two points.
My first point is of a financial nature.
It is all nonsense.
I want to publicly reject this.
I eagerly await your response.
The situation is very grave.
But I was talking about the social implications.
They are made infertile without knowing it.
The matter still requires clarification.
Ambiguity is very wrong here.
The EU should not promote abortion.
There are details that raise concern.
This raises concerns.
This raises huge concerns.
Does the definition of the World Health Organisation apply?
This includes termination of pregnancy and therefore abortion!
This means that 87% has a different cause.
In short, we are setting the wrong priorities.
Is the Commission aware of these positive results?
I refer to Uganda and Zambia.
In South Africa beneficial effects have also been acknowledged.
I eagerly await Commissioner Nielson's response.
These women are pillars of their society.
The facts speak for themselves.
Maternal mortality continues to rise in developing countries.
They also die from unsafe abortions.
(Applause from the Left)
I would ask the Commissioner to reconsider that.
Abortion is a sensitive subject, and rightly so.
I think Amendment No 53 expresses this very appropriately.
They are scurrilous lies that should be retracted.
I am pro-choice.
It is for each individual to decide.
(Applause from the Left)
This I absolutely support.
The Commission welcomes them.
I am confident that we will find a solution.
This is the purpose of all this.
I disagree.
It is a change of the substance.
This is not a clarification.
This is a change of the substance.
I advise that we stay on track.
(Applause)
That was my well-intentioned warning.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
.
We have incorporated a number of his points.
I want to conclude with two important points.
We have been ambitious and hard hitting.
We invite the Council to take the same approach.
The Harbour report more than meets that challenge.
But that is not enough.
Too many barriers are still holding us back.
Removing tax obstacles is another key priority.
I respect his energy in pursuing that subject.
This list is not exhaustive.
We are still open to ideas.
In fact, they could do much better.
The November scoreboard illustrates our failure to deliver.
Is it simply a case of national protectionism?
Nothing has happened.
Mr Harbour also mentioned the subject of sales promotion.
Mr Martin spoke about a European health card.
Mr Martin may be interested to hear about this.
That is an obstacle.
Recently the Commission has started infringement proceedings.
Therefore we are determined to continue issuing those scoreboards.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
Many factors may have contributed to this development.
These are termed 'outreach services'.
Acute drug related deaths have doubled since 1985.
This recommendation does exactly that.
No Member State is forced to do anything.
This sits alongside measures on prevention.
I welcome this report.
Such measures would imply social acceptance of drug abuse.
Our governments must indeed give priority to high-risk environments.
These are the bases of the report.
An assessment will be carried out in due course.
It often results in fatal accidents.
Testing can reduce the health risks.
Drug abuse is also a threat to young people.
This approach does most to benefit health.
You have to call a spade a spade.
To do so demonstrates a sad detachment from reality.
Drug addiction is not tolerable.
It is a scourge that must be fought against.
There are no soft drugs.
Our second priority is to develop a risk-reduction policy.
We cannot relax about the addiction problem.
My thanks and appreciation to Mrs Malliori again.
It is all complete nonsense.
Prohibition fosters corruption and theft.
This paper is an excellent step forward.
It is a vicious and cruel approach.
Madam President, I am deeply concerned, Commissioner.
The trend is in the wrong direction.
This is the way we should be going.
The analysis is very comprehensive and good.
Consumption is generally presented as an individual problem.
.
Most of the suggested amendments strengthen the recommendation.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at midday.
, rapporteur.
How did we get to this stage?
She said that nobody would listen to her.
Firstly, the need for responsible advertising.
Finally, there must be responsible research.
This issue will not go away.
This paper will be finalised in the coming weeks.
Personal privacy must be protected.
Advertising will increase demand for implants.
What is needed, however, is balanced information.
They are needed to reconstruct breasts.
She sends her apologies.
It affects one in eight women.
Operations for medical reasons would be exempt.
France has already introduced a ban.
I agree with the rapporteur concerning the age limit.
Advertising for cosmetic surgery should carry clear health warnings.
I therefore feel it superfluous to mention a passport.
Our main aim is to see patients protected.
That is crucial.
We want to guarantee that.
Why is compulsory registration so important?
That is why proper registration is essential.
Finally, protecting the patient.
I am very satisfied with the report.
That delay set us back years.
What happened as a result of that delay?
Why?
Because they affect people's health.
I would like to make one final point.
For whom actually?
And what for?
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
.
.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
I am referring specifically to sterilisation and abortion.
.
.
.
.
.
The report contains only sensible amendments, however.
We Moderates are therefore voting against the above report.
.
That is a good thing!
.
We must respond to this.
We will have to pay specific attention to prisoners.
I have therefore voted in favour of this proposal.
.
.
I support the Malliori report with some minor exceptions.
I abstained from voting on this report.
I am critical of this attitude of resignation.
Drug abuse in institutions would then be legitimised.
.
.
.
These weapons are scattered all over Greece.
.
Let us take the example of Caesareans.
We are always getting bogged down in details.
Is this Europe's business?
I have therefore voted against the resolution.
.
It could not have been put any better.
Commissioner Byrne has the floor.
Nowadays the European steel industry is very competitive.
This requires anticipation and adequate management of those processes.
These basic assertions attract a wide consensus in Europe.
This in fact anticipates the European Company Statute.
What is needed now to ensure restructuring is time.
That raises a number of questions at European level.
Commissioner, you referred to Metaleurop.
It goes back 25 years.
Who is responsible?
Who should pay?
Let us think about that.
How do you expect that to work?
We entirely support it.
There is no end to this arbitrary phenomenon.
That it what is heinous, Commissioner.
It is promising a restructuring plan and early retirement.
But who is it trying to fool?
Nor indeed are state aids possible.
We all know that.
That is indeed the case.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The situation in the region is apparently quite delicate.
There are therefore quite a few examples of intimidation.
I was expecting it to start at 4.30 p.m.
There is increasing intimidation and persecution of the press.
And there is a series of new criminal cases.
Mr Duvanov's trial was closed to the public.
That is not entirely satisfactory.
Kazakhstan must not slip on its road.
We are watching, listening and supporting.
Opposition parties do not exist in these two countries.
This scrutiny has certainly been justified.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Nor ought the issue of oil to be forgotten.
In our opinion, the worst is now passed.
The debate is closed.
Yet again we find ourselves having to discuss Zimbabwe.
No wonder that the EU is not taken seriously.
We have provided him with superb publicity.
Mr President, there has been a little confusion.
He is opposing the resolution.
I do not know how that mistake was made.
Zimbabwe is no longer a democratic country.
We also have the usual African problem of AIDS.
Not even a Convention will help bring one about.
The opposite is, however, urgently needed.
Free, honest elections are needed soon.
Fear currently prevails in the country.
This is intolerable and our condemnation is unswerving.
This is for a renewable period of one year.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned
.
This is not the issue.
Resumption of the session
Not very clever at all!)
That is why we oppose a new resolution.
Thank you, Mr President.
In fact I would just like clarification on something.
I would definitely welcome that.
The only issue concerns when it should be voted.
(The order of business was thus established)
I find this police control unacceptable!
I think that you must do something about this.
You could at least be consistent!
(Applause from the right)
That, eventually, was the good news.
We will follow that up for you.
These women are accused of ordering the assassination.
All their hearings have taken place in camera.
I take note of that.
I would like to know why.
The April meeting is our chance to do so.
We have a delegation participating in that.
I am sure the Rules were complied with.
I have no quarrel with that.
What does concern me is the political aspect.
I take note of your point.
It was not a request to hold a debate.
That procedure was followed in this case.
This is intolerable and must not happen again.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I am sorry to interrupt.
We are running over the allotted time.
This applies equally to developed countries and developing countries.
I shall now come to the negotiations themselves.
What are our objectives?
I may come back to them later.
First of all, energy services.
These include the United States, Brazil and Japan.
The defensive role in this matter is my responsibility.
In this matter, we have allies.
Another aspect is education.
This applies to universal service obligations.
We must provide access to the services markets.
We must also provide our own training.
Can we expect something like this from the Americans?
Developing countries have not rejected GATS completely.
My group would like to focus on that point.
Mr President.
That is my first question.
My second question is to Commissioner Reding.
Secondly, the mandate.
Finally, development.
Let us look at the figures.
The figures show that it clearly is not.
Indeed, GATS does contain provisions on investments too.
These negotiations are certainly more than crucial for Europe.
A moratorium is not a good idea.
Why these fields and not others?
It is right to anticipate that.
Liberalisation is always going to be difficult.
Far from it!
We want to look at how markets will evolve.
That includes the developing world as well.
That is what we want to encourage.
Let us be positive about it.
Let us move ahead!
(The President cut off the speaker)
So trade in services far exceeds trade in goods.
Thus GATS also contributes to the Doha round.
The right to culture is a fundamental human right.
Culture is not just another commodity.
We witness the fight to preserve public services daily.
No country must be forced into taking particular decisions.
The developing countries are particularly vulnerable.
This time, we will stand firm.
This is a considerable percentage.
Let us be very clear on this issue.
I have explained these principles on numerous occasions.
That is perfectly normal.
He is quite right in what he says.
There is no wolf here.
It has not been opened and remains closed.
Mr DÃ©sir, I completely understand all your reservations.
I share a number of them.
It remains closed.
We are not considering the liberalisation of services.
We should not confuse two completely different debates.
These include energy, transport and postal services.
Please do not bring the dock workers into it.
The dock workers sector is not on the list.
They are concerned about the internal market.
Overall, I agree with him.
I understand all the feelings expressed.
I recognise these are sensitive issues.
Not a single one!
No such commitment has been given by any country.
I am not surprised by their statements.
The Commission is ready to do just this.
There are a number of reasons for this.
Culture has another dimension.
It is linked to our roots and our diversity.
It is an idea we should work on.
The Treaty now provides for this.
We are most certainly opening up to others.
You will appreciate that culture necessarily entails opening up.
I would thank the Commission for these contributions.
We are unable to exercise parliamentary control.
It follows that we need clear and binding guidelines.
They have not said that up to now.
Firstly, the question of competition between ports.
The Commission understands the current concern here.
A message of progress but with every guarantee.
I, for one, find it incomprehensible.
We have nothing against these people.
We believe this to be wrong.
They therefore have nothing to do with this directive.
Thank you, Mr President.
That is something we urgently need.
Everyone has commented on it.
The Council subsequently made its position known.
As he said, their protest is legitimate.
Well, I am waiting for an evaluation!
We have been waiting for a while now.
They all insisted that maritime safety begins at ports.
We are still waiting for this.
Please can we link these two matters.
This directive has a single aim.
Self-handling provides an example of this liberal vision.
I oppose it.
I would like to say something about two matters.
Firstly, self-handling.
The second point of interest is pilotage services.
Anyway, what else is this directive about?
We are opposed to it for three main reasons.
Why are we opposed to this?
We would like to pose the following questions.
Who will ensure compliance with social standards?
Mediation with the Council is therefore on the horizon.
Sufficient guarantees can be built in.
There is no threat, there are just opportunities.
This competition is trampling all over the dock workers.
That means a return to the old situation.
We must ensure that compulsory licensing is introduced.
These proposed rules are throwing their businesses into turmoil.
The same must apply to self-handling.
This is transparent competition.
Thank you, Mr President.
Why?
That could have been enlightening.
So why did we not vote it out?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
What can I add in a minute?
This directive brings ports of convenience closer.
Nobody is asking for this.
That is all we need.
So they can choose for themselves.
That is something I hope Parliament will do.
Yes or no?
Secondly, we have an entirely ideological question.
This is essentially an ideological question.
But when there is competition things work better.
What does this have to do with the Prestige?
Absolutely nothing, ladies and gentlemen.
It bears no relation.
I am sorry, but they are different issues.
Nobody wants social dumping, ladies and gentlemen.
Nobody.
I would read two things to the honourable Members.
One, what does self-handling mean?
Let us tell the truth, please.
You are politicians, ladies and gentlemen.
Nobody is proposing social dumping.
That is simply the European model.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (ARTICLE 120)
Finally, I will mention Amendment No 2.
But biofuels remain uncompetitive without significant government tax breaks.
Why?
This time we shall not get any further ahead.
The compromise amendments are satisfactory.
Biofuels are in many cases manufactured from organic waste.
Biofuels offer new sources of income for European industries.
The economic and environment benefits are obvious.
Fuel alternatives are extremely welcome.
New technology is being developed constantly.
These must not be forgotten.
We want to promote innovation in this sector.
The promise had been made by others.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It issued a favourable opinion.
We then tabled this improved plan to the Council.
I myself opened this hearing just this morning.
.
The industry will go into free fall.
These lights represent information beamed from the satellite-tracking systems.
Our fishing communities are crying out for help.
Please heed their call.
Fishing is an economic activity.
We must acknowledge this.
Talks will focus on a long-term cod recovery plan.
We can already feel the effects.
I urge everybody to support this.
There must be a balance in the stocks.
Clearly, it is the fishing effort that matters.
This is worse than we thought.
Let us not forget it!
But how?
Please take note!
But this time it is extremely serious.
That was done in a cooperative way.
But what is the future to be?
High-wire negotiations only lead to mistrust.
Their views should not be overlooked in any way.
It is precisely the reverse.
There is no way round this.
Is this something that the Commission might also consider?
I declare the 2002-2003 annual session closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.29 p.m.)
Opening of the session
(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)
We will do that.
Let me start with enlargement today.
Here I refer to the western Balkans.
The first job is to complete economic integration.
Absolutely not.
Giving in is absolutely out of the question.
What kind of Europe do we want?
What guideline are we following?
This brings me to the Convention.
We have completed the enlargement negotiations.
Together, we can succeed.
It is an historic and unique occasion.
First I shall deal with the substance.
We have asked for a report.
It has not been produced.
I would like some clarity on that point.
This is where the Commission started out.
We still find irritations here.
We would like to see that document.
President Prodi mentioned the International Criminal Court.
That was a mistake and a failure.
Now for the third objective - sustainable growth.
The European Union is indeed not a supermarket.
Let me give you an example.
I take as an example the agreements concerning chemicals.
This really leaves me dumbfounded.
It is shocking and cannot easily be explained.
This phrase could give the wrong impression.
Further discussions will be needed on this subject.
What are the priorities of the 2004 budget?
We shall have to determine this more precisely.
We shall have to look into this.
Is that not excessive?
(NL) Thank you, Mr President.
We have just appointed a new Ombudsman.
I heard what the Commissioner said earlier.
I welcome that.
Timing is critical in this.
My group fully endorses the report.
Unfortunately it cannot currently be guaranteed.
We are on the threshold of enlargement.
We want enlargement.
That is something we cannot accept.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We can endorse this choice of political priorities.
Is that not completely out of proportion?
Political parties are free associations of citizens.
There is no functional justification.
There are just two things I want to say.
That starts with administration.
I should like to focus on foreign policy.
We have been making do and mending for years.
We will never be involved in decision-making.
This working group is about to start work.
Sound implementation is crucial for the 2004 budget.
Many issues are still outstanding.
This should be a dialogue.
It has been a huge undertaking.
There are no discounts.
There is absolutely no leeway on this.
This cannot go unnoticed.
Thank you, President Prodi.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
That is quite clear.
Thank you for your attention.
His is an excellent report.
This has now become a common position of Parliament.
This would ensure an effective response to unexpected situations.
Unduly rigid provisions have sometimes served to safeguard expenditure.
I therefore believe updating is imperative.
Several points are now obsolete.
Precisely the opposite applies in the European Union.
This cannot be allowed to continue.
Resources should henceforth come directly from the citizen.
This is a basic feature of democratic responsibility.
This is bad for democratic control.
Personal and possibly progressive taxation should be introduced.
Please excuse this crude simplification.
The result is unhealthy populism.
I give him my most sincere thanks for that.
The two matters must go hand in hand.
It should be abolished!
(Applause)
We can all, therefore, understand its importance.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Mr Muis did not attend last night.
(Mixed reactions)
(Mixed reactions)
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament approved the request for consultation)
(Parliament approved the request for consultation)
(The President declared the common position approved)

Before the vote on Amendment No 48:
(Loud applause)
We will thus now vote on Amendment No 13.
Before the vote on Amendment No 16:
Before the vote on Amendment No 45:
The rapporteur seems adamant.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote on Amendment No 8:
I ask for your permission, Mr President.
Thank you for your cautionary advice, Mrs Frassoni.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
Naturally, I fully support this report.
.
.
.
The directive specifically mentions staff.
.
The risks of social dumping are clear.
.
We supported and still support their action.
.
.
.
.
It also takes pilotage services a step forward.
The second point is more complicated.
That would benefit no one.
.
.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Were we too ambitious, too euphoric?
Were not today's crises foreseeable even then?
The one is inseparable from the other.
Jobs call for the right financial framework conditions.
They want more training and can take the strain.
Another important point is partnership.
This last point brings me to timetabling.
The other countries are therefore doing somewhat worse.
How is that possible?
That is a very interesting question.
That is the way to bring it together.
Increased stability in the employment strategy is indeed necessary.
My group is therefore inclined to reject these amendments.
It might be enquired whether they were too ambitious.
Two different approaches were thus pitted against each other.
The other approach was quite different.
We must put our faith in quality.
That would be a welcome step forward.
I am not being pessimistic here, just realistic.
Item 37 emphasises this extremely clearly.
These are not fresh ideas.
They are completely obsolete.
We must maintain and improve the incentive to work.
These issues are exclusively for Member States.
In short, nothing has happened.
I would like to end with a comment.
The scenario and pace are now quite different.
In general, these are older people.
Women also need support.
These enjoyed broad support in committee.
That is backtracking.
The first concerns the objectives of the spring Council.
My second point has to do with discrimination.
My third point has to do with women.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mr President, this is indeed an important issue.
That is a relatively small and manageable body.
We have presented two options in this context.
Such improvement should be substantial.
The Bank's own classification should be used instead.
This is the thinking behind our proposals.
They envisage interpretations going beyond the enabling clause.
We differ on this in two respects.
As you are aware, this is still outstanding.
The solution is not rotation but weighting.
Rather than more complexity, we want greater transparency.
What we actually need is an ambitious European solution.
Should we differentiate between monetary policy and operational decisions?
Where should the strategic decisions be taken?
It is absolutely obvious.
You have shied away from it!
We therefore do have enough time.
Our colleague Dr Friedrich has already spoken about this.
It has also been severely criticised.
Commissioner, we must prevent an unduly divided Europe.
That is a requirement that cannot be abandoned.
The present rules must be reformed.
Everyone seems to agree that reform is necessary.
The report was by Mr Brok.
These proposals affect the equality of the Member States.
Two proposals by Parliament are worthy of support.
Why?
This is unacceptable.
The ECB's proposal reflects this truism.
Mr President, I shall be brief.
Two different issues have emerged during this debate.
Such a system would have to involve rotation.
This system will of course involve a change.
Not everyone will be present.
The enabling clause does however provide for this.
I sympathise with these views.
It would resolve the potential problem of the transition.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next Thursday.
Question Time will follow at 5.45 p.m.
The objective is twofold.
There are various possibilities.
Will the European Conference be revived?
Will it remain with Commissioner Patten?
These are the questions that interest me.
Perhaps you could explain the situation in more detail.
It is not easy.
We have tried it in the past.
That is not the subject of this communication.
I have a long list of Members before me.
This is not relevant to this afternoon's debate.
We must be perfectly clear about this.
The same applies to North Africa for example.
I should like to endorse Mr Lagendijk's question.
I really only have one question.
Membership is something different.
There is no longer an iron curtain.
There is no exclusion any more.
I would like to ask two questions.
I think this is an important point.
My second question relates to the Balkans.
Perhaps the Commission could review this position once again.
What form will the financial instrument take?
He raised a couple of points.
He also referred to the Balkans.
That will be the policy that we continue.
It is not our fault that does not exist.
The debate is closed.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I
.
We can only warmly welcome this.
We would not need to hold further negotiations.
What can the Commission do to improve the situation?
That is the only thing that we can do.
I then went to another meeting.
I really would therefore crave your indulgence.
I know all of this.
I hope I pronounced that correctly.
I am not quite sure.
Czech is a difficult language!
That is the connection.
We are acting on this matter.
Subject: Accession negotiations with Slovakia and the Roma minorities
A special investigation team was set up.
He really is very convincing on this issue.
Part two
Questions to Mr Fischler
Subject: Guarantee of food distribution to disadvantaged groups
In his answer to Question E-1695/02
Have I understood that properly?
Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) 2341/2002
Yet I would ask you to be more specific.
Can you be more specific?
It is certainly important to monitor what happens here.
Will they too receive aid based on historical rights?
Has the Commission forgotten young farmers?
In addition the proposal also specifically accommodates new farmers.
We do actually need to do much more here.
Unfortunately, this requirement is not always respected.
I turn now to the question of import controls.
Let us continue with rice.
EBA: Everything but Arms.
How can we guarantee that?
How can it be controlled?
How can we ensure that this is the case?
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
But it says something further.
On financial markets we are essentially in agreement.
Some even hoped that it would.
Their fears have nonetheless proved groundless.
EMU has been very successful.
Nothing at all would have become of it.
Unquestionably through an increase in employment and productivity.
Today you clean forgot about it once again.
We want to strengthen the Commission's independence.
It is essential to mobilise all human potential.
This is yet another contradiction.
Europe must devise a policy of her own.
We in Europe have our backs against the wall.
The Convention, however, is silent.
The GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil report does contain discrepancies.
It mentions taxation, not interest rates.
.
Nor must we now go back on that.
The Treaty is not being respected.
What could the outcome be, Commissioner?
Europe needs a strategy for growth.
You said so yourself in your speech.
This comes across as being extremely self-contradictory.
Sweden has a well-run economy.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Growth means movement; stability means the opposite.
Certainly, the reality is dialectical in nature.
Will this remedy kill the patient?
This has not happened, however.
We should envisage policies of Keynesian cyclic recovery.
They have all had socialist governments.
This particular tree must not obscure our vision.
No solutions have yet been found for the latter.
This is certainly a laudable aim.
We are not setting new objectives.
What we are doing is finally taking ourselves seriously.
We say 'yes' to competition policy.
We say 'yes' to a benchmark.
We must learn from each other.
These are basically good rules.
That would undermine confidence in the euro and EMU.
The same applies to state finances.
That is something I believe would be constructive.
It all seems to have gone differently, however.
Can we really not do any better than this?
Now is the time for action.
Clearly there is room for improvement.
I am sure the Commission recognises this.
Growth and stability are twin pillars.
However, we are still falling behind competitively.
They are both in our synthesis report.
I believe not.
And this is true.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Parliament's first reading produced 458 votes in favour.
This directive is a success for the European Parliament.
We amended the Commission proposal at first reading.
This directive is not the end product.
It is a first step.
It has still not liberalised the assessment stipulations.
The lump sum payment will continue to be permitted.
In those circumstances, I would support it.
What matters, rather, is the content.
This is a vast potential market.
Overall this is an excellent measure.
I commend it to the House.
This is absolutely clear.
This is affecting pension funds.
It is not a form of saving.
Pensions are for life.
They provide for workers when they retire.
They also offer certain guarantees in case of incapacity.
Reversion pensions provide for surviving spouses.
Pensions are not financial products.
Savings products have been dressed up to resemble pensions.
This is a social approach which my group applauds.
We need to guarantee European citizens decent pensions.
I am also very pleased with this compromise.
It is quite clear that not everything is regulated.
That is certainly true.
Finally, Mr President, the tax issue.
We have recently had the Danner ruling.
That is a subject for social policy.
The status quo is not an option.
It took 15 years to establish common EU laws.
Compromise was very necessary.
That is a statement of fact.
That is an important minimum.
Mr President, Mr Karas deserves our admiration.
What do old people want?
Security, independence and autonomy.
We ourselves have to take care of it.
At least it is an agreed text.
On that issue Member States remained deeply split.
Here the Commission kept its promises to take action.
That is a clear case of discrimination.
Therefore the Commission has no opinion on them.
That is a good thing.
One never knows where conciliation might lead.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
Iraq
Please sit down and remove the banners.
(The Members complied with the President's instructions)
This is where Europe has a voice.
You know what they are.
However, inspections cannot continue indefinitely.
We have taken important initiatives here.
The presidency has done likewise.
I personally have recently visited the region four times.
This close collaboration is ongoing.
So we are also working with them.
Europe is a community of values.
I have always been acutely conscious of its limitations.
(Applause)
But that is not my point.
I am not making a quasi-legal point.
It seems pretty obvious to me.
We must not be disheartened by this setback.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
What happens if there is a war in Iraq?
I want to ask two questions.
We have been told that will happen.
European leaders have been told that will happen.
I sincerely hope that is so.
That would further inflame opinion in the Islamic world.
(Applause from the centre and the left)
(Applause)
That is at the heart of the problem.
We are America's friends and partners.
That is true of our group.
(Applause)
The same will be true now.
(Applause)
This is something we have to make utterly clear.
(Applause)
Let me just make two additional observations.
Partnership and friendship with the Arab world!
(Applause)
Six months later, there was war in Baghdad.
Why?
(Applause)
(Applause)
That is our second trump card.
For example, we always defend the Treaties.
There would be no inspection and no disarmament.
I do not understand it.
That is very good, that is excellent.
What, then, are we doing with Turkey?
The Turkish parliament is elected.
Fine.
It is a democracy.
I simply do not understand it.
Obviously, they will find it fantastic!
Yet we are leaving them to fight alone.
(Applause from the left)
That would be a stupid position.
We cannot have it both ways.
Thousands of its people have been killed.
No one can forget that.
Who, though, was responsible for those attacks?
It was the Al Qaeda organisation.
The answer is no, there is no proof.
That is extremely worrying.
There is something nice and surreal about our debates.
I believe that there is.
(Mixed reactions)
That is the truth of the situation we face.
(Applause from the right)
We spoke with one voice on the Palestinian problem.
And yet, our united voice went unheeded.
And again, our united voice went unheeded.
It would be contrary to international law.
The peace talks must begin again.
Now, the drumbeats of war can be heard.
Hopefully, war can still be averted.
Mr President, what is this war about?
We do not like Saddam Hussein.
That is a symbolic and clear difference.
That is unfortunately not the case.
History will be the judge.
Thank you.
Why?
It is simple, Mr President.
The real actors are still the nation states.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The Iraqi people are innocent.
This war will precipitate a conflict between civilisations.
The reactions will be terrible.
They have already begun.
We must preserve peace.
It is also an old-fashioned way of settling conflicts.
It is a question of democratising the Arab countries.
Thank you.
We believe that there will be one.
We believe that war is avoidable.
That will depend to a large extent on Europe.
What happened in the case of the former Yugoslavia?
(The President cut off the speaker)
What an admission that is!
Yet, on 15 February, another upheaval occurred.
The veto is now on the streets.
They deserve our respect.
That is not a success.
But for how long?
At what point do we say enough is enough?
The future of the world is at stake.
If we do not we are lost.
We must bar the road to ruin!
Among democrats, such a thing should be self-evident.
This is where Europe has become less important.
Does Iraq possess the smallpox virus?
What was done with the mustard gas grenades?
Here lies Europe's great mission.
That is why the weapons inspections must continue.
The disarmament of Iraq is underway.
One simply cannot adopt an Ã  la carte approach.
The people of Iraq need alternative political leadership.
NATO effectiveness may have been fatally undermined.
What possible motive could there be for this?
Much nonsense is talked about who armed Saddam.
We are where we are today because of that.
Let us look at the politics.
The failure of the CFSP is our fault.
Congress approved this and Europe largely ignored it.
So speaks the United Nations.
And this is one of the problems we face.
Whether the glass is half full or half empty.
However, we do have a common position.
What happens next?
It rests with the Security Council.
What are the threats today?
How are we going to deal with these issues?
How are we going to deal with terrorism?
We understand the scar left by September 11.
And this is not a weak Europe talking.
It is a Europe of values and experience.
Our partnership with them is very important.
Mr Cohn-Bendit spoke about democracy in the Arab world.
We therefore have to cultivate democratic institutions.
Turkey.
(Applause)
However, these efforts are not finished.
We want the Turkish Cypriots with us.
We want them here in this Chamber.
(Applause)
This teaching power is a decisive factor.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
The next item is the vote
That seems rather like haggling.
We are not joining in this charade either.
Work that out if you can.
Why is this so?
Thank you.
You did not disappoint us.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
The group leaders will have noted your comments.
Joint motion for a resolution
We very much appreciate this effort.
.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
.
.
.
.
.
We reject this forced takeover.
.
.
Is the WTO an organisation for dismantling public services?
It should also be public.
This is a wonderful example of the democratic deficit.
.
It is a real attack on the working classes.
Public services should not be part of negotiations.
.
We voted against it.
.
According to the WTO, the answer is yes.
Everything is a commodity.
People pretend that they want to preserve cultural diversity.
We must have an adequate fishing industry.
This is not cap in hand.
The money is willingly being offered.
Let it be taken up.
.
Employment rates are dropping in both Greece and Germany.
.
.
.
I am therefore happy that Parliament has rejected it.
.
.
.
What crime have the employees of Metaleurope committed?
.
Hence our vote against the report.
.
.
.
That approach is unacceptable.
.
.
I have consequently voted in favour of this report.
Unfortunately, this item remained in place.
The euro requires clear and stable rules.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
The minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(?he Minutes were approved)
This operation is important on several counts.
It will facilitate the application of the framework agreement.
It is expected to last about six months.
Brigadier-General Maral has therefore been appointed as force commander.
Tomorrow evening I had planned to fly to Belgrade.
These efforts have been paying off.
Our objectives are clear.
This encompasses two crucial elements in particular.
Thank you very much Mr President.
This could be better organised in future.
I refuse to do that.
This would send a very good signal to Macedonia.
Of course it was only a small-scale conflict.
We cannot go on this way.
It is using NATO resources.
Peace has not yet been established.
This is a new measure agreed on in November.
Sadly, it has not worked.
They have been given a false prospectus.
Finally, to the funding of the mission.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Let me now turn to the business in hand.
I should like to make one final personal remark.
Discussions amongst elected parliamentarians on such issues is essential.
The Commission accepts this reprimand.
It had no intention to conceal.
We only have a short time.
It is necessary to correct a misunderstanding.
This is the first step in the process.
These discussions are necessary.
Why are they necessary?
That indeed had already started.
There are in the meantime transfers of data.
Are such transfers legal?
They can also be unilaterally abrogated if necessary.
That I think is a major step forward.
I wonder how this is possible.
This is a stunning rebuff to the Commission.
That must be right.
Therefore it is academic.
And that is not all.
How can this be?
Who do the United States think they are?
The international police?
And where does this leave the European Union?
Why does the European Union have data protection laws?
How humiliating is that?
This will really have to be solved another way.
What does that mean?
Even meal preferences can say something about a person.
What have we done to allow this to happen?
So this is a very serious matter.
It also contains exceptions that we could meet.
In my opinion this has not been satisfied either.
That is totally wrong.
I might add one question and one answer.
That would be absurd.
So a horrendous problem has arisen here.
This procedure is quite simply unacceptable.
This too is totally unacceptable.
He needs to get a sense of proportion.
That is a very simple basic principle.
Our points of view are oceans apart.
What is at issue here?
The aim is to protect people.
And what information, Commissioner, Mr President!
It must be a mutually satisfactory solution.
The American side has accepted that.
Our discussions so far have yielded this result.
We have not yet achieved an agreement.
That is true.
It is happening now.
That is bad practice in terms of data protection.
We shall examine Questions to Council.
The person with ultimate responsibility is Parliament's President.
My question to Council was tabled as No 3.
This is discrimination.
All I want is an answer.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Subject: Status of Kosovo
Mr President, I would first like to apologise.
So the reason was an error in the interpreting.
Please accept my apology.
I have two short supplementary questions.
It is Security Council Resolution 1244.
We can see what has happened.
Do you have more precise information on this subject?
That is why we talk of standards before status.
Subject: Guantanamo Bay
Negotiations are still under way.
Subject: Maritime transport
I share Mrs Riitta Myller's concerns.
What is the Presidency's view on this matter?
What initiative does it intend to take?
I thank the honourable Member for his questions.
I have just two comments.
Is this possible?
Subject: Flags of convenience
I must stress this.
The rest will follow as an inevitable consequence.
Why not give this a try?
There have been accidents in the European Union.
I agree with the speaker.
The United Kingdom has an extensive coastline.
Greece has an extensive coastline.
Subject: Poisoning of stray dogs and cats in Greece
Thank you, Mrs Flemming, for your question.
I admit that is asking a lot of you.
Very possibly.
I personally think these are worthwhile proposals.
Subject: Enlargement
Thank you for your question.
That is a separate issue.
Questions No 10 and 23 have been withdrawn.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
We propose a number of measures in the report.
We are definitely lagging somewhat behind.
One important target is the use of gender-neutral language.
I hope there has not been a misunderstanding.
We are not expecting a commissioner for this debate.
Mr President.
The debate has moved back into the home.
This, however, is to ignore the facts.
That is what this report is proposing.
This is, however, a dream.
Still nothing has changed.
It is unbelievable.
Why?
We are emphatically far from being so.
The experience acquired varied somewhat.
No, that is not how it is.
We must keep on beating the drum.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon tomorrow.
We do not see that everywhere.
That is my first point.
Member States clearly cannot remain uninvolved.
Our calls have fallen upon deaf ears.
That is what I am backing.
Good work has been done.
But people working on the ground still report frustrations.
That is something we need to investigate.
We ourselves present the biggest obstacle.
Progress has been made, but this is insufficient.
There is also a strong link with education.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon tomorrow.
These measures are binding on all UN members.
I therefore congratulate Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar on his report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon tomorrow.
Parliament has been waiting for this report.
That is why we are meeting here this evening.
That relates to controls on Community funds.
This is due to be completed shortly.
This is a key moment.
We really are at a turning point now.
This is a total perversion of justice.
Secrecy should be the exception and not the rule.
This is all we are calling for.
What would have become of Eurostat without OLAF?
That issue is still being pursued today.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon tomorrow.
(The sitting was closed 11.10 p.m.)
Consumer Policy Strategy 2002-2006
They were set out as a threefold proposal.
Firstly, a high level of consumer protection.
An informed consumer is an empowered citizen.
I now turn to the report by Mrs Patrie.
All of us agree with that.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Let us not be over-confident, however.
Of course that prohibition must be well defined.
We have made choices based on considered legal grounds.
It has three key objectives.
We therefore commissioned three major studies.
Only 1% of companies expects a decrease.
.
Various committees have delivered their opinions.
I can only express my thanks for that.
Section 15 deals with international private law.
I have already mentioned that specifically.
That is right and proper.
I hope the Commission takes these points on board.
Such a verdict would indeed be well-deserved.
The consumer must reign everywhere.
Long live the king!
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Some consumer rights stop at national borders.
There are four points I would like to emphasise.
Point two, the right to information.
Information about products and production methods is crucial.
My final point concerns political responsibility.
Splendid of course, but what has it achieved?
Or take the euro, another example.
The euro was supposed to make everything cheaper.
Of course, things can go against us.
Every consumer understands that.
Or nowhere in fact?
Thank you very much.
Confidence is the engine of economic growth.
We can kill two birds with one stone.
That is not easy.
Consumers often do not know what their rights are.
Consumer organisations can help with this.
Consumer magazines are widely read and contain useful tips.
People have a lot of confidence in these organisations.
Just think about changing your bank.
They make it terribly difficult for you.
We must not reduce the citizens to mere consumers.
A recent example is that of cosmetics and detergents.
A high level does not necessarily imply uniform protection.
How could we ensure their durability?
The Consumer Credit Directive is one example of this.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Why is this?
I shall try to illustrate that with an example.
He applied to the appropriate overarching professional body.
He wrote in his own language, English.
Codes of conduct have to be properly enforced.
We need all these things.
This same principle must also apply to mutual recognition.
However, the path is not strewn with roses.
The obstacles and technical difficulties are manifold.
I hope that the Commissioner is also satisfied.
They get better eggs, which taste better.
A number of Members mentioned full harmonisation.
This has led to legal fragmentation.
The importance of this is further heightened by enlargement.
I turn, briefly, to mutual recognition.
A number of Members raised the issue of simplification.
I know people are calling for it.
This was one of the main issues for consultation.
A number of Members mentioned codes of conduct.
Any endorsement process should be voluntary.
We are looking at this.
There are a number of different aspects.
I turn to Mr Whitehead's question on funding.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at noon.
I therefore ask that these banners be removed.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
.
.
.
.
.
We have also voted against the ECB's proposal.
.
This is completely unacceptable.
.
.
1.
2.
.
That is something I cannot on any account support.
.
Hence our vote in favour of the report.
.
Hence our vote against the report.
.
The concern that this issue has raised is justified.
.
.
.
We would like to protest against this concealment.
.
.
It has to be about combating unfair trading practices.
I voted wrongly on the conclusion to section 23.
.
.
.
.
Hence my vote in favour of this report.
.
It will be noted in the Minutes.
Thank you for pointing that out.
Commissioner Fischler has the floor.
The other case is as follows.
The European Union's priority is employment.
Something must be done urgently.
Such action also ennobles and dignifies the European Parliament.
What you are proposing will no longer suffice.
Consequently, we cannot remain indifferent.
In such cases, no new jobs are created.
That is why I want to contribute.
That is the reality.
What are we going to do about it?
Mr Santos was the first person to mention that.
We have funds from the sixth framework programme.
Producing goods at a lower cost is crucial
That is the sort of fundamental change we want.
That is what the Commission has to encourage.
Nothing.
No additional sanctions at present exist.
That is the decisive factor.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
July 2003;
This must be condemned.
The draft resolution before us is therefore opportune.
The US shares this view.
Two weeks ago, I went to Phnom Penh.
The situation remains extremely worrying.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place after the debates.
Thus, the requests are quite clear and direct.
We expect a response from the Commission.
The time for theoretical statements has passed.
This resolution is very strongly worded and comprehensive.
Every situation is distinct and calls for different measures.
We are seeing this with Iraq.
We have been at this for years.
What have we to show for all this?
The sanctions should be rigorously enforced.
Torture, detention and forced labour are common practice.
Consider, for example, the tragic child-soldier system.
It must also undertake to pursue ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Everything that God has forbidden goes on in Burma.
The European Union must strengthen the sanctions against Burma.
A ban on foreign investments should be introduced.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place after the debates.
Under Islamic law, she is guilty of treason.
What a pity the Commissioner is not listening.
We are out of our minds with worry.
We have no idea what is happening in Nigeria.
The leadership must take a stand against these issues.
Mr President, Commissioner.
So you still have a little time, Commissioner.
And here we are voting on another resolution.
I raised it in my group.
It is not a feminist issue either.
I am grateful for that.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a moment.
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
EXPLANATION OF VOTE
That was the last item on the agenda.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 5.25 p.m.)
Welcome
Otherwise, our debate will have no effect.
Mr President, I endorse this statement.
(Applause from the left)
Luckily, there is unanimity here too.
Of that there can be no doubt.
It was a very good and responsible debate.
(Laughter and applause)
President.
Or even university chancellors!
Patten, Commission.
This debate takes place against an extremely sombre background.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
How can we now pull things together again?
We should redouble our efforts.
We must remain true to it.
It is a strategic choice for our continent.
And it is a choice of historic proportions.
(Applause)
It has also conducted several missions to neighbouring countries.
I should like to add one point here.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Interruption: And why was that?)
We really do regret that most deeply.
Pope John Paul II ...
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
It is that that we must remember today.
(Applause from the right)
That is the responsibility that we ourselves bear today.
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
The chronicle of a war foretold is becoming reality.
(Applause from the left)
Our current situation is really very difficult.
This is something we must persevere with.
And that is our responsibility.
(Applause from the left)
We are loyal partners and not servants.
(Applause from the left)
That is absolutely absurd.
(Applause from the left)
This is unacceptable.
(Applause from the left)
This is therefore a responsibility for the Commission.
And therefore we cannot live in fear and terror.
We must live in a positive way.
(Applause from the left)
This is an essential point.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, this is not a just war.
(Applause from the ELDR Group)
Europe must play its part with no hidden agenda.
What are they offering the Iraqi people?
The eviction of Saddam Hussein?
But then what?
Who can truly believe that this would be accepted?
Will they pursue battles with other rogue states?
This will pose a threat to the whole world.
(Applause from the left)
(Applause from the left)
We voiced our opposition to any unilateral military action.
This is what they expect of us.
(Applause from the left)
The United Nations has not failed.
This they have clearly failed to do.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
The second message concerns ourselves.
(Applause)
This is not true, ladies and gentlemen!
The Iraqi affair is merely revealing the true picture.
The European Union is deeply divided.
That is the reality of the situation.
We shall have to resolve to do this.
Everything else is incidental.
Will we have the strength?
You say we are acting unlawfully?
As unlawfully as de Gaulle.
You are as law-abiding as Vichy!
Cowardly Europe, Vichy's Europe!
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the left)
That has to be said first.
We must again seek new unity within Europe.
(Applause from the left)
(Applause from the left)
I regret the letter of the eight members.
These are facts.
What must our agenda be?
The Turkish Kurds are fearful of being militarily overwhelmed.
The Kurds in Northern Iraq fear permanent occupation.
Long live the sovereignty of the world's nations!
Long live the Iraqi nation!
And long live France!'
Sometimes it is more profitable as well.
(Applause from the right)
Kofi Annan represents the law, Bush does not.
In 1991, there was the UN.
A great deal of damage has been done.
We have lost.
(Applause)
The UN resolutions are clear in this respect.
Have we forgotten September 11 already?
Bush wanted this war.
International trade has slowed down.
Let us not allow ourselves to be led astray.
Mr President, we must mobilise all our resources.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, this war was a foregone conclusion.
Popular protest was ignored and UN backing dispensed with.
Question one: where to now?
Is this the difference between democracy and dictatorship?
Is this the difference between dictators and democrats?
Down with war!
Long live peace between nations!
We cannot compare President Bush to Saddam Hussein.
(Applause from the right)
Saddam Hussein's criminal regime must be disarmed.
Iraq will need a very great deal of help.
Here too the perceptions have differed.
This is a strength, not a weakness.
It is the basic principle of democracy.
The second was the need for our humanitarian presence.
Commissioner Chris Patten spoke about this.
Thirdly, numerous references were made to reconstruction.
But here again we have an important responsibility.
That is not where the problem lies.
That is what the European Union is.
A community of values.
A community of principles.
That is what unites us.
But the momentum is there.
I am not making a quasi-legal point.
It seems pretty obvious to me.'
Indeed it does seem obvious.
That must now be done under proper UN authorisation.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Institutional change can certainly help to create political will.
I do not doubt that at all.
(Applause)
That brings our extraordinary debate to a close.
(The extraordinary sitting closed at 11.45 a.m.)
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
Resumption of the session
He was a Vice-President of the ACP-EEC Joint Assembly.
They are members of the Christian Liberation Movement.
Journalists, dissidents and human rights defenders were targeted.
The Presidency did not agree with these views.
We have a direct interest in developments in Iraq.
You shall have your opportunity to speak.
The second priority is to promote innovation and entrepreneurship.
The European Council issued guidelines.
What are they?
On the contrary, the divisions widened.
That is our objective.
Peace and progress in the region.
Could we discuss this sort of agenda?
No, it is not.
The impasse was also clear.
There was no point in discussing it.
And that is what we did.
Is the Union of Europe split at the moment?
Yes, it is.
Ladies and gentlemen, what is our objective?
But that is not strictly true.
There are common positions on numerous foreign policy issues.
Policies in other sectors are also taking shape.
And there are also divisions in other sectors.
From the common agricultural policy through to immigration policy.
And it will be some time before they do.
(Mixed reactions)
You are perfectly correct.
I will therefore begin my speech today with that.
They need to be highlighted in this debate too.
Let us start with security.
Today, history is repeating itself.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
There must be no more victims.
My group therefore believes the war must cease immediately.
The United Nations must assume management of the conflict.
I support Mr Annan.
(Applause)
Mr Perle is a shameless lobbyist.
(Applause)
The doctored images presented to us conceal horror.
I hope your consciences are stirred.
They wish to enjoy freedom and dignity.
I could not agree more.
That is not the way forward.
I believe we should make our voice heard.
(Applause)
He will speak on the Spring Council.
My point is as follows.
It is disconcerted and overwhelmingly opposed to this war.
There is a world-wide movement for peace.
I have in mind Saturday's demonstration.
(Applause)
I should like to cite just three examples.
That hardly augurs well for the Italian presidency.
And third: raising levels of employment.
Humanitarian aid must get through.
That much is clear.
I urge them to stop and think.
The choice is between two clearly defined positions.
Right is on your side.
They have every right to do so.
(Applause)
That is the problem confronting us today.
It is actually quite easy to solve.
Others state it is neither legal nor legitimate.
That much is plain.
That is the plain truth!
(Applause)
That is a historical fact.
One must call a spade a spade.
(Applause)
I refer to the Europe of the institutions.
Europe certainly did speak with a single voice.
Even better, Europe spoke with the same voice.
So what?
The difficulty lay in that it served no purpose.
It is far more complex.
That is the crux of the issue.
That last word comes from Greek, Mr Simitis.
There has been much talk of one.
Why not?
Why not say ethical, Dany?
All your moralising, all your absolutes!
Me!
Yet we are treated to empty words.
The Presidency is not to blame.
The summit must have had one sane moment though.
Paragraph 9 of the conclusions reads as follows.
'Nonetheless, there is still a lot to do.
No connectivity means fewer exchanges and less growth.
Mr Poettering is concerned for the euro.
On the contrary, it is now actually widening.
Unfortunately, it did not do so.
His attitude is ridiculous and paranoid.
We must be enterprise-friendly.
That was almost surreal.
Each of these troikas has its rationale and support.
Robert Kagan might be proved right.
Is that really our aim?
I will therefore concentrate on the socio-economic aspect.
It is now time for deeds.
That is precisely where we stand at the moment.
That is where our duty lies.
Following that, Iraq must be reconstructed.
Iraq must not become an American protectorate.
We need a common foreign policy.
A paradox?
No.
With this war, the masks have come off.
What can and should we do?
(Applause from the left)
The Council remains silent about that, Mr President.
The war is happening.
It is an event of major significance.
That was a lie.
This has now been revealed.
That was a lie.
The Security Council was not stalled.
It had adopted a procedure that was working.
Iraq was supposed to be weakened.
That proved to be another lie.
Iraq is offering strong, often heroic resistance.
That too was a lie.
Iraq was said to possess weapons of mass destruction.
Sadly it is justified.
I believe in calling a spade a spade.
Tony Blair is merely an urbane murderer.
Iraq remained a festering sore.
There is no sign of peace there.
Who is not still embarrassed by that?
I find that a good left-wing stance.
There is little point in their looking back.
But what is the presidency's role?
That is the first thing it has to do.
Why?
Because the European Union has applied a foreign policy.
Are there only a few?
Yes!
There are only a few.
We have to make that effort.
And it is up to us.
But we do want a Union!
And we want a strong Union.
It was examined.
That is clear from the text.
It is important to remain level-headed.
The Iraqi people have suffered enough.
We are the disease'.
It is also, unfortunately, barbaric.
President Bush has spoken of a crusade.
I salute the courageous resistance of the Iraqi people.
They know what those promises are worth.
This policy will not go unanswered.
Unfortunately at this stage consensus appears impossible.
We agree with the Council on this.
It might be termed an extra-Community venture.
I congratulate it on that.
What is this right that we are talking about?
The UN Charter has been flouted.
What has happened to our compliance with that article?
That is a frightening thought.
This war is a disaster from the moral viewpoint.
Our leaders are letting us down.
They must enjoy self-government within a federal democratic Iraq.
Israel continues to violate international law with complete impunity.
The future of Europe depends on it.
Then there is the Middle East.
We do not think this is the case.
We need to rebuild a western strategic culture.
An illegal and neo-colonial war is currently underway.
Every day it shows us its real face.
They have responded with deep tax cuts.
There are no short cuts.
Action is what we need.
We still have our responsibility for the future.
(Applause from the left)
That is also somewhat surrealistic.
Good for him.
But what is the realistic thing to do now?
This is the challenge that Parliament too must address.
I would like to discuss three things.
We must place the emphasis on the real economy.
This is called 'coherence of policy'.
I would therefore like clarification on this point.
The third point concerns pensions.
I can understand that this cause generates strong emotions.
The European Union has actually become an economic power.
This is probably due to our own shortcomings.
To date, it has not been completed.
Where is the actual timetable?
Where are the detailed objectives?
Where is the road map?
Let me now turn to Iraq.
It is also called 'more United Nations'.
Are they fundamental reasons?
Are our positions irreversible and irreconcilable?
Independence does not mean breaking alliances.
My second thought is about the future of Iraq.
Are we ready?
That is what we should be asking ourselves.
My party will continue to oppose tax harmonisation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
The Presidency trusts the House will understand.
I do not understand the Council.
Responsibility for this lies with the Council.
Those are not threats, but statements.
That is what we are doing.
There will be something to be cheerful about.
We consider it as a joint objective.
Our group does not want to block enlargement.
We do not want to delay enlargement.
What nonsense is this?
I do not have much faith in that.
This unfortunate situation impacts us all.
A fresh negotiating proposal is on the table.
Then the text of this draft Treaty suddenly appeared.
This is inconceivable.
I find it quite intolerable.
It deals with the basic laws of human stupidity.
That is exactly what happened here.
An unprecedented dispute then arose because precedents were ignored.
Allow me to give an example.
At the moment, I do not trust them.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
That has been the central part of our task.
What about the new principles?
It was a good basis on which to build.
We found the Commission had done good work.
He made special mention of the correction coefficients amendment.
We must however ensure they have a free choice.
Civil servants understand what they can write.
We should not introduce preventative censure measures.
Thank you for your attention, Mr President.
I would like to make one further comment.
Indeed, this is the aim of the reforms.
We are also in favour of modernity, however.
It was, however, a very worthwhile experience.
That document has been circulated.
That clearly manifests our position.
It answers the first question in the oral question.
That should make Amendment No 30 redundant.
Now are putting our own House in order.
These amendments are very positive.
Mr President, I also congratulate the two rapporteurs.
For instance the expatriation allowance he referred to.
The Commissioner also referred to it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
.
Pesticides are increasingly becoming an environmental and health problem.
Pesticides cause cancer, mental illnesses and fertility problems.
Then there is the cost.
The Commission launched this broad consultation with the Communication.
Nonetheless, the Commission's proposal contains significant gaps.
A great number of comments have therefore been made.
Ladies and gentlemen, we should de-mystify organic farming.
I agree with some of the rapporteur's observations.
Consumers have the right to be informed.
I also agree with her analysis of GMOs.
This form of spraying is often the only choice.
Unfortunately that is the idea.
This is the right way to get tangible answers.
That is to be welcomed.
The approval system needs to be improved.
Consumers want a very good quality product.
In fact, they have become accustomed to this.
It is as simple as that.
Mrs Van Brempt wants a general 50% reduction.
So a general 50% reduction is not right.
I think that these discussions should be kept separate.
We can do that if we want to.
I challenge everyone to scrutinise my report.
I know they are necessary, even advisable.
I also try not to do that myself.
I would like to say one more thing briefly.
I am not stupid, I know that too.
Why do we need these taxes?
That is one of the many challenges.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
We must continue to look at this issue.
But the compromises we have reached are reasonable.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
It would introduce harmonised rules throughout the Community.
We need a new system.
We need a new chemicals policy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The previous agreement with Morocco expired in November 1999.
Why not?
Where are the log jams?
We worked with great determination to rectify the situation.
As we had anticipated, it proved too rigid.
We are not asking for more money.
I think two of these are extremely relevant.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
From the outset, we worked collectively and diligently.
That is the idea behind the proposal.
The third point concerns the protection of intellectual property.
Europe can address the health crisis and social distress.
Secondly, we must focus on developing specific products.
New means are necessary to combat this old disease.
We support this clinical trials project wholeheartedly.
This is clearly counter-productive.
The rapporteur has already cited the figures.
This is innovation.
There is, of course, a multi-pronged attack.
This point has been made by other speakers.
That is what we want at the end.
That will be the outcome of these clinical trials.
What have the Member States done?
It is a vicious circle.
A new kind of cooperation is needed.
Instead of bullets we should be using medicine.
The programme itself marks a turning point.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11 a.m. today.
The time is ripe.
Cigarette smuggling is the best example.
The principle of subsidiarity is the maxim here.
Their proposals have been incorporated into this report.
As I said, the time is ripe.
Such coordination would require an enormous new apparatus.
We cannot harmonise everything in this Union, however.
In these areas we can only coordinate.
Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen.
But only a minority are totally against the project.
Specific proposals for a constitution are now being discussed.
It stops short of the actual objective.
That is the risk.
But we do not agree entirely on every point.
This is being discussed.
That also has to be made very clear.
This is true of the question of secondary law.
They know there have been initiatives like OLAF.
We know everything is not yet perfect.
Massive amounts of European taxpayer's money are involved.
I find all this unacceptable.
These are basic issues.
Is there a public demand for this?
No.
Will it be more efficient?
No.
Will it deliver a better form of justice?
No.
No.
That is where I am coming from.
That is the 'hole'.
The answer is to stop digging.
Stop giving the Community money.
The essentially corrupt and uncontrolled system is the problem.
Attack the cause, not the system.
The existing options must also continue to be developed.
There are difficulties in relation to cost and bureaucracy.
We need more internal reforms.
The current system does not work.
I do not see it this way at all.
We have provided OLAF to further investigate suspected problems.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place shortly.
(Applause)
I support it on behalf of my group.
(Applause)
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
I look forward to that final vote.
.
It is highly ambiguous.
.
.
.
.
This shows that health is a global public good.
.
I congratulate Mr Caudron on his good work.
.
.
But sadly this is not the case.
.
All 15 Member States should follow Europe's example!
Fourthly, even the pension problems remain unsolved.
This does not look like serious decision-making to me.
You should do as we have done!'
.
.
That is our position.
.
.
.
.
There was a boxing ring.
You did not want to raise it.
You did not want a resolution.
This is a dark day for Parliament.
.
He would do better to stay away.
For the Greek people he is persona non grata.
.
.
.
.
The majority that rejects stopping it becomes an accessory.
.
.
.
.
We have the following comments on the actual proposal.
.
.
(FR) I voted for this report.
This is clearly not the case.
.
.
'But of course we are!
.
Not a problem!
.
.
And enlargement gives the problem a further dimension.
.
Something must be done.
That concludes the votes.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 1p.m.)
Resumption of the session
The following changes have been proposed:
Monday
Wednesday
It is now disastrous.
It is not news.
I am therefore against such a statement.
The first decision was utterly deplorable.
This, to us, is a responsible attitude.
EU alleges Israel was spy.'
This demonstrates the current paranoia of the Castro dictatorship.
We have already tried to intervene in the matter.
Stop the killing'.
That is incorrect.
It is the season for organised school trips.
What is it?
Where does it come from?
How does it spread?
How can we stop it?
This Network serves to survey and investigate the outbreaks.
However, this does not give grounds for complacency.
The second element of this strategy is prevention.
This is a key lesson for the future.
The centre will enhance surveillance.
In Europe the situation still appears to be manageable.
Finally, one last point: biological terrorism.
It says:
I do not believe that they will.
Are we prepared for those eventualities?
We are eager to find out!
No!
So far, we have not achieved them.
At this stage, what can be said?
However, we have been able to prepare ourselves.
SARS is a very serious problem.
The precautionary principle must be applied.
My group, the Greens, suggests four measures.
It appears that the scientist died from the virus.
There is no applicable treatment.
They are:
I am also concerned about it.
We need to change that.
The debate is closed.
The programmes are no longer so rigid.
I will close with a reference to ECMT licences.
Therefore, the control requested is not necessary.
This directive is important for several reasons.
Would that transport system look like our present one?
I hardly think so.
That too is reflected in the directive.
That is not possible.
It would be just too risky.
Finally, I hope that we can avoid conciliation.
Unfortunately accidents involving lorries often result in fatalities.
The sector is itself looking for good professional drivers.
My proposals now simply go too far.
We want to improve road safety.
I will not go into all the details.
It is as follows.
I will be coming back to this.
This requires the training programme to be flexible.
The signals from insurance companies on this are clear.
This brings with it considerable risks for the drivers.
Many thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent work.
Four young people were killed on the roads.
There is a difference.
Why is this one of the key factors?
The Member States therefore need time to implement this.
Firstly, the transport sector can become more professional.
Better drivers should be driving on our roads.
This is not insignificant for a Kyoto-sensitive sector.
As control further increases it then becomes counterproductive.
Thus what we have here is reverse social engineering.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
It is therefore very good news for Europe.
This programme covers the period 2004 to 2008.
It proposes four actions which are all very specific.
They will lead to officially-recognised degrees.
Secondly, the establishment of a scholarship system.
I would like to thank them for that.
I shall now come to occupational training.
We must observe a certain balance.
Promoting mutual cooperation can only benefit the universities.
First, what is the language of knowledge?
This is an objective that we should consistently pursue.
For what can we still be a motor?
That cannot work without education.
We have to show our colours!
That is what is expected of Europe!
That is an obstacle.
Let me just say something about the financial arrangements.
It will also further strengthen the bases of democracy.
There is nothing free in this world.
I believe it is an important and reformist document.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The second conclusion concerns the use of technological resources.
This programme has three main pillars.
The second pillar is the virtual campus.
Information and communication will therefore receive particular attention.
I would just like to mention three points.
We must not neglect these people.
I fully support the budget increase.
I particularly like the idea of e-twinning.
I hope this is used to its fullest extent.
We formulated our first thoughts on eLearning in 2002.
Can it also be used for this?
Yes.
This eLearning programme offers new opportunities in this area.
I therefore thank the rapporteur for his excellent work.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 8.48 p.m.)
2001 discharge procedure
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
We are still waiting.
That is not the case at present.
We shall examine the results closely.
We therefore request that it be delayed.
Naturally, he will also receive our discharge.
It starts with the most important news.
My report has 120 sections.
Another difficult area is the appointment of senior officials.
That costs the taxpayer almost EUR 4 million.
This is beyond our control.
This is an important element.
Postponing discharge until October would not change anything.
I think we should reward it for that.
The remaining agencies must wait.
Many of the agencies have very large administrations.
That is not necessarily their own fault.
Various solutions may therefore be considered.
More tasks could be transferred to the agencies.
All these programmes have different rules.
The Commission itself publishes its housekeeping figures monthly.
But is that enough?
No, it is not.
Our accounting must be on an accrual basis.
That is 2 660 contracts.
It cannot be done by July.
The first is Palestine.
The second is the KEDO programme.
The third programme is pre-accession aid.
The situation is indeed alarming.
We all know what that means.
I come now to the European Social Fund itself.
I really cannot understand this.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
Our committee can make proposals but not set parameters.
I think this new rule complicates the discharge procedure.
They must then be discussed in a hearing.
I ask you to vote in favour.
I think that is a sensible way of proceeding.
There are always both options and not just one.
Take the example of the accounting system.
It is important to note that.
As general rapporteur, Mr Casaca set clear conditions.
Secondly, a Financial Regulation has been adopted.
Nor could we do that.
Consequently, we recommend discharge.
I should like to say a little about agriculture.
That is unacceptable.
We were not equal to the task.
That was an injustice.
Instead, they dismissed Mrs Andreasen.
Unfortunately, it did not work out like that.
I would like to support Mr Blak's remarks.
The EU was not created yesterday.
The Commission can therefore take the criticism easily.
The test has not been passed.
We have no right to grant discharge.
It takes time.
We have overcome a difficult hurdle.
We trust you also with this exercise.
The other rapporteurs have also suffered external pressures.
Commissioner, you raised the issue of Eurostat.
OLAF is doing its work very well here.
There have already been two cases reported to Luxembourg.
Do you know what super users are?
We are back with the reform here, Commissioner.
We have such things in our agencies.
It must be stopped.
One last point.
That is not the way.
Other speakers will be saying more about it.
We are convinced it is not.
The situation there can only be described as alarming.
The internal auditor said three things.
There are more such cases.
We do not need them.
Mr Casaca has done a very good job.
The reform of the accountancy system is essential.
We have to remember that context.
That is something we have to bear in mind.
We are interested in delivery.
They pay full respect to financial regulation.
The right wing must listen.
There are the enduring problems of monitoring.
That was in 2001.
I utterly reject this insult.
That concludes the debate.
The next item is the vote.
(The President declared the common position approved)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(The President declared the common position approved)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
Amendment No 15 therefore concerns Paragraph 65 b.
.
.
.
However, subsidiarity continues to be constantly violated today.
We do not agree.
It is the people who ratified the Treaty.
It is the people who should decide its limits.
.
Is it dangerous to drive these vehicles?
.
.
These aspects have been crucial in ...
.
.
.
.
.
greater intercultural dialogue
language learning
the development of lifelong learning and
the exchange of good practices.
.
.
.
.
The effects are already beginning to be visible.
.
.
.
I shall be voting in favour of this discharge.
This motion of implicit mistrust deserved to be rejected.
This is what you must say!'
And that is what I am saying.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
It is an important conference.
The conventions date from 1961, 1971 and 1988.
Different drugs have different groups of users.
Ecstasy users are a different group entirely.
My final point concerns the classification of drugs.
This is a shrewd piece of work.
We support the preservation of the UN Single Convention.
Is this really logical?
I would put this question to Mr Pirker.
What is this actually all about, Mr President?
I cannot do that.
I must honestly admit that I cannot.
This is not true!
This resolution got off to a bad start.
Any ambiguity in this field will lead to disaster.
'It is their choice whether they take drugs in prison.'
I could almost believe it.
The anti-prohibitionist lobby has to suffer some heavy blows.
The spirit of the Buitenweg report is clear.
Harm reduction alone is not a solution.
We take the same approach to tobacco addiction.
Meanwhile, the destruction of lives goes on.
'A drug-free world: we can do it.'
This was the great slogan.
We paid for helicopters and armies.
We paid for the militarisation of our society.
This report states a basic position.
People have spoken about zero tolerance.
It will not work.
There is no evidence to support zero tolerance.
There is no easy solution.
We must be outward-looking in this Parliament.
It is not the conventions that are at fault.
We know what he is after.
You should reject the resolution.
This is something I cannot accept.
The report we have here has considerable impact.
What a brilliant strategy the Americans must have!
That is why I am somewhat critical of it.
You can even hire institutions for it, anyway.
I find that very entertaining to listen to.
I do not believe in that position at all.
I do not think much of that.
Furthermore, the Netherlands has had a rude awakening.
Therefore, that classification has invalidated itself.
They have hope.
That is something that is apparent from various passages.
The pressure is increasing upon young people and families.
This I cannot agree to.
This policy has had good results.
We need to review the UN Conventions.
Will he find the solution in the Netherlands?
What message do you have?
Is the Dutch model the modern one?
Is this the outward-, forward-looking one?
There are so many different concepts floating about.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
This will prevent differing treatment within a single family.
I believe that would be a good exercise.
She had a very difficult job to do.
Would this not be more practical?
Nevertheless, allow me to make some criticisms.
A child is a child.
Such inconsistencies are unjustified and unjustifiable.
What a joke!
But the floodgates have been opened.
They have for all applicants.
Is this the real purpose of family reunification?
All of this must stop.
The proposal presented by the Commission is sound.
Mrs Klamt's remarks and her interpretation saddened me.
I look forward to supporting this report.
Their tactics are clear.
I adore my wife.
What is the new structure?
What is the new conception of the employment package?
These reforms relate to people's needs.
We therefore propose a series of quantitative targets.
A change of policy is therefore needed.
Of course stability is a public good!
Mrs Diamantopoulou has already pointed this out.
The second is the non-cyclical nature of these guidelines.
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
Mr President, I have three questions.
Growth, employment and social welfare belong together.
Could he perhaps repeat it?
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulos.
Mr President, I will reply quickly.
I would ask you to be brief.
This is an environmental, purely an environmental issue.
Perhaps Parliament's services made a mistake.
Mr Alavanos, I take very good note.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I
Subject: Selling of goods via the Internet
If not why not?
I should like to answer Mr Bowe's question.
Moreover, these relief thresholds are optional.
I thank you, Commissioner, for that reply.
However, could you not take action more rapidly?
This is a serious problem.
Why this change?
Graduation is not a sanction; quite the opposite.
Does the Commission intend to renew it?
We do not think so.
You can express a contrary view.
Until when?
Would a specific derogation for agricultural products be welcome?
Finally, what will happen in 2004?
Subject: ECHO in Iraq
Regular monitoring visits were carried out before the crisis.
Such visits have now been suspended.
I would like to mention the main ones.
That is where that discussion should start.
Thank you very much for your reply, Commissioner.
It concurs with my own.
The Secretary-General has made this clear.
Thank you very much, Mr Nielson.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Liikanen
So there is still a great deal to do.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
Questions to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m
Subject: Endocrine disrupting chemicals and test methods
In its opinion of 26 October 2000
This research includes the development of novel testing methods.
Mr President.
This is clearly a cross-border problem.
Subject: Setting up a European civil defence corps
This became apparent once again after the Prestige disaster.
Which Member States have already agreed to cooperate?
When did they appeal to it?
I was in Galicia ten days after the disaster.
There cannot be more than two questions.
Mr RÃ¼big, your supplementary question.
We are at the moment.
Even with scant resources we have been very effective.
Mr Ortuondo Larrea, you are absolutely right.
This is a matter of implementation.
They regularly do this.
Are you aware of that difference of opinion?
This point is very important.
This was exactly the point.
We have such different views on this.
This is a completely different issue.
The funding will be tested against existing environmental legislation.
There is one on this issue.
I am fully aware of that.
We will begin the final part of Question Time.
Mr Vitorino will answer these questions.
Questions to Commissioner Vitorino
Subject: Common border policing
But the Council has not set a date.
The police academy does exist virtually.
The Seville Conclusions are balanced conclusions.
Millions of mobile phones are stolen every year.
There is also a data protection problem.
Thank you very much.
The IMEI approach has already been discussed.
However, we will definitely not drop the issue.
Subject: Franco-German charter flight
Commissioner, thank you for your explanation.
By definition a group is a number of individuals.
Gladly, Mr Krivine.
That is the difference.
Collective expulsion is prohibited.
That is the essential difference in my opinion.
(Applause)
You can count on our support.
(The speaker began in Macedonian.
The following paragraph is a translation)
(The speaker continued in English)
Then, however, we managed to step back.
Progress in implementing the Framework Agreement is steady.
Recent months have seen substantial progress across the region.
It has strong trade links with the EU.
(Applause)
In this I am hoping also for your support.
(Applause)
We thank you.
(The President invited the speaker to conclude)
Let me give you an example.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
My eighth point follows on from this.
We are all in agreement.
Thank you very much, Mr Ceyhun.
Halfway through a debate, he left the room.
It submits regular reports to the Council.
The evidence that worried me was given last November.
I find this quite simply scandalous.
I think that this is a very constructive approach.
That Regulation must be applied.
I hope it will have your support.
Nations are forced to lift national border controls.
Consequently, Europol is created.
The debate is closed.
I congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The analysis of the report raises certain critical questions.
Finally, the national authorities act as a filter.
In addition, information must be clear and documented.
Proper, objective information for citizens is a necessity.
I know that nothing has happened in Copenhagen.
There is something not quite right here.
That also came across from what Mr Ilgenfritz said.
No, they are not!
No, they are not!
Not satisfactorily so!
I do not believe it will.
Why not?
Euronews is a good objective.
What does this mean?
We have to get that message over.
I am not criticising Germany or France.
There is a responsibility upon Member States.
The second point I want to make concerns Euronews.
We will succeed.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Announcement by the President
This is a choice for Members of the House.
I deeply appreciate those sentiments.
They are here to follow our debate.
There is still much to be done, however.
(Applause)
(Applause)
The budget is not usually an emotive subject.
And the annex affected the basic competences of Parliament.
The results of negotiations have achieved this institutional equilibrium.
Some have already expressed their will.
My first comment is that these are tense times.
It cuts across a broad range of Union policies.
Everyone has a right to share in this future.
Enlargement brings this vision much closer.
Who are the peoples we are talking about?
What will they bring to the European Union?
That adds up to a very good result.
The answer is perfectly clear.
(Applause)
Are we ourselves sufficiently prepared?
My answer to that has to be more tentative.
From the technical point of view, we are.
Both are approaching the goal.
The Balkan countries have prospects of accession.
(Applause)
Our group has always had that as its objective.
That is what we want for our continent.
(Applause)
Others fear that there will be more division.
It is an historic day for Europe.
We have been passionately committed to enlargement.
That is something emphasised by Commissioner Vanheugen.
This is precisely where the shoe pinches.
We therefore support enlargement.
Each country has its own history.
These societies are both reformist and conformist.
They want a better future.
There are a number of relevant examples.
We cannot have it both ways.
The situation is very simple.
This point is not included in the Brok report.
Almost all members will vote in favour.
Only one member will abstain on the issue.
Now these have at last been regained.
Thankfully, these have now been concluded.
I am delighted at this prospect.
Parliament will have other opportunities to defend its prerogatives.
Europe will be reunited.
Another thing: these new countries include Cyprus.
Part of Cyprus is occupied by foreign troops.
Decrees.
It was two years late in commencing reforms.
The thing I warned against several times has happened.
Europos S?jung?!
What has happened to the enthusiasm for institutional reform?
Where is the enthusiasm for agricultural policy reform?
I am highly optimistic about this.
Lithuania has its own problems.
Europa was Zeus's consort.
The mother of Minos, Sarpedon and Rhadamanthus.
The cultural element has always been present.
The element of quality has always been present.
We are all Europe.
Not new Europe and old Europe.
Malta has recognised this opportunity.
But that referendum is not binding.
It is a unique opportunity for Malta.
I am speaking now as an Austrian.
This enlargement is a reunification of Europe.
The best solution would be to delete the paragraph.
.
They are not unique.
We have apparently been too impatient.
It takes time to tackle these problems.
Two more criteria were formulated at the Copenhagen Council.
We await the next progress report from the Commission.
The time has now come to go forward together.
Impartiality is essential in these areas.
The timetable must be observed.
We must make room for our common future.
What are the Union's limits?
I would actually like to say something about borders.
What a transformation to Europe we are seeing!
It will not come by accident.
Today is a new beginning.
The European model of cooperation must therefore be successful.
At least they were acceptable.
Fortunately we have been able to reverse this.
That has cost the Council money.
Duly noted!
Warsaw has forgotten Europe's memories.
Enlargement would mean a Europe of lies.
That is going too far!
Mr President, you are Greek.
Ten more countries is excessive.
Germany and Berlin were divided for 28 years.
Cyprus and Nicosia have been divided for 29 years.
Let there be an end to this.
(Applause)
There are several reasons for this.
There are clearly other reasons, however.
The people of Europe are not ready.
How quickly Euro-regions materialised!
We must not be deterred by the present difficulties.
(Murmurs of dissent)
These emerging democracies deserve better.
(Mixed reactions)
In 1956, Hungary bravely rose up against dictatorship.
I myself am descended from Czech and Hungarian grandparents.
We have not yet completed this major building project.
We do not really know each other yet.
All in all, we should be optimistic today.
I believe we have done enough talking now.
The time has come for action.
(Loud sustained applause)
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENTS (RULE 120)
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
President.
(Applause)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote on Amendment No 19:
(Mixed reactions)
(Loud applause)
May this be a signal to the European Convention.
We want to determine our own seat.
(Loud applause)
Before the vote:
.
We therefore abstained on this report.
.
.
The Council must get out of that habit.
.
I have therefore rejected the rapporteur's proposal.
I refer to intergovernmental legal instruments respecting national sovereignty.
.
Why?
This assessment is misguided.
.
We do not agree with any of these points.
I therefore voted against the BÃ¶ge report.
Only part of this finance would be retained.
.
Everything else, I regard as empty words.
We shall instead descend into confusion.
In other words, it is a pittance.
There is no mistaking the signs.
Allow me to explain the reasons for my vote.
Decrees by Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
This is why I voted against the Brok report.
Consequently, I voted in favour of assent.
It will be fettered from the outset.
They do indeed have a rightful place amongst us.
Undeniably, this is their Europe too.
My vote was intended to express this concern.
.
.
.
Promises given have not been honoured.
This contravenes the agreement reached at the Berlin Summit.
Consequently, the Community will soon stall.
.
.
.
This is an historic day for Europe.
Europe is united in freedom.
.
Some of these are detailed below.
.
.
.
.
It is derisory.
.
.
It does not provide for equality between the members.
The countries of Eastern Europe are particularly affected.
I voted for this with great satisfaction today.
Enlargement from the outside is taking place.
It may also take place from the inside.
I hope this process will commence soon.
.
That is what we promised our electorates in 1999.
Today we begin the European twenty-first century.
Ten new flags appeared in our Chamber today.
.
.
.
My vote is intended to be a signal.
.
I hold the opposite view.
The new Member States understand solidarity quite differently.
Those are the facts and we must accept them.
Europe needs freedom and flexibility.
It can do without ideology.
.
We must expect it to be long too.
Their political systems became democratic.
All this was achieved in a few short years.
Its memories are still fresh in their minds.
We have no right to do so.
The unification of Europe is a historical challenge.
We shall pay a heavy price if we do.
.
The following steps need to be taken without delay:
.
.
None of this happened.
.
Monitoring too must be taken seriously.
And yet I voted in favour.
We must not upset this result today.
Our hope lies in the Convention.
.
Our bodywork is unfortunately not yet 2004-proof.
The present policy of product subsidies is outdated.
Old Europe and new Europe will disappear in 2004.
The message also has the advantage of being positive.
That I cannot do.
I shall now give the second of these.
Try to get your minds round that one!
My mother died in January.
I cannot go along with that.
I did not make this decision easy for myself.
The Immunity Act remains part of Czech law.
.
It can no longer be delayed.
Minor differences must not be allowed to obstruct it.
Enlargement has already taken too long.
The Commission expressed its opposition.
It found ways of imposing a different approach.
.
This is an unambiguous verdict.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
That would still be very little.
The Member States see themselves as net contributors.
.
.
After all, force is what it understands best.
The Union is still invoking conciliation.
.
.
.
The mind boggles!
This is yet another wasted opportunity.
We therefore needed the European Convention.
.
.
.
.
.
I hope that they will soon come back.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
They want to reduce Parliamentary sittings in this town.
Yet again, this vote contravenes the Treaty.
Parliament is not actually a sovereign body.
It must comply with the latter.
.
This is a completely abnormal situation.
In our opinion, the situation is clear.
.
.
The explanations of vote are now closed.
This is the second reason.
I am not sure.
He called this the gap of ambition.
The Morillon report also touched on this.
We have arrived at a crucial turning point.
That is exclusively for the Member States.
There is considerable scope for improvement here.
This hypocrisy has slowly disappeared from this Parliament.
They are closely bound up with one another.
It is also of the greatest importance for production.
The Greek Presidency has responded positively to this.
Prime Minister Simitis said as much recently.
These ideas include many of those expressed by Parliament.
They just need to decide to do so.
This report could hardly be more timely.
Better defence spending must be accompanied by stronger decision-making.
What do we want exactly with European security policy?
Where do we want to act?
What precisely do we need for it?
When do we want to do it?
This seems very good to me.
There's the rub!
Let us now be completely clear about this.
We must be able to act faster and better.
Mr President, it is always the same.
Fifty years later, here we are again.
We have not made any progress.
Europe must be built on reality.
All this is of no importance to politicians.
An enlarged Europe needs to be stable.
Why were military budgets cut back in this way?
This is currently being debated in the Convention too.
It is supported by 71% of them.
The war in Iraq has divided Europe.
The rapid reaction force must receive more attention.
Nor is that the intention.
I am however in favour of an open process.
This is a great threat to security.
This European Union contribution is a success.
This is not something you can promote half-heartedly.
We must act on this.
Previously it was optional, now it is essential.
There is no other way forward.
This proposal clearly runs counter to our current needs.
Having two seats allows both to be expressed.
What are we doing?
In this sense, this is a useful debate.
To see where we stand.
On that I congratulate Mr Morillon.
Why is that necessary?
I believe this to be perfectly possible.
That is quite appalling.
Otherwise they will do better to remain silent.
Clearly NATO is already dominated by the United States.
We must also be resolved and practical.
I think it should be put into effect.
The Morillon report is not a pipedream.
Previous speakers have also highlighted its comprehensive nature.
He deserves our thanks.
I note Commissioner Patten's reservations about this aspect.
However, they also express its political correlations.
However, the problem persists.
Where do the famous Petersberg-type force and missions stand?
Where does the Eurofighter stand?
We are watching this space.
Cicero's words still apply today.
I do not think so.
Take Kosovo, for example.
?.
We need a common European approach.
That is a fact.
Are we actually willing to take on a role?
Can a military capability help us?
I see that as unacceptable.
We do not have this capacity at present.
The current system is inefficient and expensive.
I hope this will be successful.
I do not want a core Europe.
I do not want a fragmented Europe.
It is our fault as Europeans.
On the contrary, cooperation needs to be deepened.
Unfortunately they are right.
Thank you, Mr Martin.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
It is a standard reply, a cool reply.
Subject: The Western Balkans and the Copenhagen criteria
This is a sad legacy of the civil war.
Sad for all of us.
And yet this war ended 54 years ago.
Is this issue included in your general position?
Do you intend to settle it soon?
That is another matter.
This is why my question has not been allowed.
Despite this, I have reworded it.
Because there have been and they are all legitimate.
I am simply talking about the Rules of Procedure.
I apologise for this.
This is not any other type of debate.
Subject: Unlawful detention of Greek national at Amsterdam airport
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
This has nothing to do with law and order.
It has to do with freedom of movement.
I shall reply as the Greek Deputy Foreign Minister.
Subject: Accession of Croatia to the EU
Greece as a country supports Croatia's candidacy.
Subject: Humanitarian aid for the Saharan population
Subject: Human rights situation in the Western Sahara
Subject: Western Sahara dispute
Subject: Western Sahara
Subject: Western Sahara
Subject: Western Sahara - human rights
Subject: Oil prospecting in the Western Sahara
The European Union expressed its satisfaction following this event.
Mr President, thank you for your reply.
We need to apply pressure.
We need to apply far stronger pressure.
This does not constitute a question.
Consequently, I see no cause for disagreement here.
I would like to reiterate the question I posed.
Is the Presidency of the Council?
If so, what is the Council's reaction?
How does that position show respect for international legitimacy?
I shall look into the matter.
In any case, I apologise.
I had no intention of causing offence.
I would ask you please to answer my question.
I do not know if there was some misunderstanding.
If there was, I am very sorry.
Subject: Preventing sexual harassment in the armed forces
Such individuals can act with impunity.
Thirty-four of these crimes were of a sexual nature.
These are completely different situations.
Subject: Meetings with Ambassadors of the Arab countries
I agree with the honourable Member.
A solution has to be found.
.
Subject: Alternative energy research and development fund
Those are the reasons for my question.
Subject: Older farmers and the demographic debate
I thank the President-in-Office for his comprehensive reply.
Subject: Digital literacy in schools and universities
I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
Things are happening in this important field.
Subject: UN mandate for the Macedonia operation
You completely failed to answer the question I put.
Please answer the question.
.
(EL) I stand by what I said.
Our proposal for a directive builds on these achievements.
Further concerns have been expressed on organs.
They are excluded from this proposal.
Further issues of concern are imports and exports.
Article 152 aims to regulate public health issues.
We have therefore introduced a number of detailed changes.
The committee has not adopted any more far-reaching amendments.
Amendment No 19 is therefore a good compromise.
The key is the protection of human health.
That will stand this measure in good stead.
Some of the changes may be unhelpful.
It certainly exercised health charities and researchers.
Organs are for another day.
Another issue is the question of remunerated donation.
Voluntary donation is preferable but not always possible.
We must find a way to stop that.
We must get the balance right.
This is a basic rule of secularity.
Our cells and tissues are not for sale.
The transparency argument is ill-advised in this case.
I believe that this report is a balanced one.
This is a relatively new area for EU legislation.
Organs in their turn consist of different tissues.
The rapporteur has objections.
Donation must be non-remunerative.
How could anyone ever imagine trading in human products?
However, we should certainly utilise the opportunities.
I am thinking specifically of disabled people here.
We cannot awaken any false hopes here.
We therefore have a good understanding of this subject.
They are indeed helping to achieve miracles.
Unfortunately, the result contains many unacceptable points.
Investors were in expectant mood.
Amendment No 82 addresses the issue of donor consent.
I can sincerely recommend Mr Liese's report.
Has individuation occurred or not?
Am I not already killing?
Yet perhaps we are discussing all this quite unnecessarily.
Let me come first to Mrs Ries.
However, it does not involve embryonic stem cells.
That is not a very coherent position.
I therefore ask you to reconsider this issue.
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
We simply cannot push this any further.
This will take some time.
But I would ask you not to do so.
I do not recommend going any further than that.
Provisions on consent vary across the Member States.
The debate is closed.
The Commission therefore wishes to make the following declaration.
Indeed we are now nearing total eradication.
The conciliation procedure was a real pleasure.
She very modestly says that this was straightforward.
Fido and Kit are best off at home.
The proposal would harmonise EU regulations.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
This report is intended to close the gaps.
It is this coexistence that is the problem.
Unfortunately, the Commission's plans fall short.
Amendments 7 to 11 cannot be accepted.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
This is in the interest of consumer protection.
Two amendments have been proposed.
It has already been approved in some 45 countries.
That is a very dangerous precedent.
I have no right to second-guess scientists.
Why is that?
What are the main concerns highlighted by this report?
My second point refers to aspartame.
My third point concerns cyclamates.
I believe that this is a realistic proposal.
There is no mention of this in the justification.
What does the rapporteur know that we do not?
Can Mr Byrne help us?
The Commission gave no substantive reason for this.
That information was not given to the committee.
No information was given to the committee!
I think we must all take note of this.
We are in a vicious circle.
Personally, I find sweeteners a difficult subject.
That suggests both political and scientific arguments were invoked.
We cannot endorse this figure for political reasons.
I believe they lack sound scientific basis.
The Commission can accept these amendments.
This is always a difficult task.
Let me clarify the following.
This is done from time to time.
I will have to give reconsideration to that issue.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
.
Ours is an historic responsibility.
.
Detergents
They are accurately summarised in Mr Nobilia's report.
It will completely overhaul and modernise legislation concerning detergents.
Otherwise we can wholeheartedly support Mr Nobilia's report.
There is work for us all to do here.
I am very happy about it.
There are after all sufficient alternatives to them.
That problem has been overcome.
It really can be done.
Then there is another problem.
Finally, on the subject of odours.
Okay, that is not what we have decided.
Another important point concerns phosphates.
In some Member States they have already been banned.
It is also a matter of public health.
We need to find products that are more biodegradable.
Madam President, I welcome this proposal.
I would ask one question, however.
Phosphates are the key question buried inside this proposal.
This proposal does not fully address that question.
We may have to revisit it in future.
We cannot leave it for another day.
We must act on that issue.
I do not believe that that is enough.
It is therefore not enough just to examine biodegradability.
Consumers must be able to choose.
That would be to lose all sense of proportion.
The new regulation introduces many benefits.
I shall only mention two.
My position on the subject remains unaltered.
Labelling is only an initial step.
I hope that will happen.
There are four points I should like to make.
Toxicity tests are desirable and cannot be skipped.
Secondly, the criteria must be clear.
The environmental benefit must also be demonstrated.
No misleading green labels, but honest information.
Then we had the compromise on phosphates.
We have here a sensible proposal.
I wish it well and again congratulate our rapporteur.
I will enumerate them later.
I will come back to phosphates later.
Fifthly, on derogations.
In this way we provide for a tiered approach.
Finally on phosphates.
The other amendments are not acceptable to the Commission.
Thank you, Mr Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
We therefore wanted a ban.
The Council has since rejected Parliament's amendments.
It should be exactly the other way around.
We must accept matters as they stand.
Thank you, Mr Bowe.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
In fact the problem is not just coffee.
It concerns many other commodities and commodity-dependent countries.
There have been calls for action on trade policy.
However, there is limited room for manoeuvre.
However, market access alone is not enough.
You could survive on planting coffee.
Competition has become tougher.
It contains caffeine, which animals cannot tolerate.
Twenty-seven ACP countries are dependent on coffee.
Now it is less than eight cents.
We want a statement and an action plan.
Is the Commissioner going?
Is the Director-General going?
How can they get away with it?
Mr Wijkman had a solution involving mushrooms.
This has been proven.
We shall continue to be extremely vigilant, Commissioner.
Parliament is full of hypocrites!
We also want to see some more immediate measures.
Why is that issue not on the WTO agenda?
I could give any number of examples.
I will, however, make a few comments.
I am sure they will reply accordingly.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The next item is the vote.
(The President declared the common position approved)
(Parliament approved the joint text)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament approved the recommendation)
(Parliament rejected the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote on Amendment 9:
I think this amendment should satisfy the Socialist Party.
The June Movement is voting against the proposal.
That disrupts the legal system.
.
(FR) We are against reproductive cloning.
.
.
Life exists and its laws are not invented.
They are discovered.
.
.
Boarding up the legislation actually has an undesirable effect.
.
.
.
.
.
Existing legislation does not fully meet these aims.
.
.
.
This contamination is uncontrollable.
.
.
.
.
How best do we serve this purpose?
.
.
I am glad that this is what has happened.
.
They deserve our support and they certainly have mine.
.
.
The reality is unfortunately different.
.
We Moderates are therefore voting against the above-mentioned report.
.
Why not?
.
In fact, quite the opposite is true.
.
.
.
.
I have therefore voted against the report.
Defence is a national issue.
We shall therefore vote against the report.
.
All that is contradictory.
We have to choose.
All the rest should follow on from that.
.
We therefore voted against this report.
.
.
.
Consequently, we have voted against the report.
We call for peace and cooperation, not war.
We totally reject this approach.
.
What a peaceful future!
.
Anything that goes beyond this I reject.
.
This would be unacceptable.
I have therefore voted against the report.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Regression has even been noted in some cases.
The judiciary lacks the means to administer justice.
I am very grateful for this initiative.
Mr President, this is an important issue.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place following this debate.
The situation in Cuba remains unchanged.
Independent journalists such as RaÃºl Rivero were also targeted.
These regrettable events illustrate why this is so.
Four days later came the arrests.
The American boycott is ill-advised.
Cuba is crazy about dollars.
That is why a new invasion is needed.
This is not, however, what has happened.
We were deceived.
All dictatorships are intrinsically evil.
I personally wish to protest against this!
We must unite our efforts to isolate Cuba politically.
I am talking about moral and political isolation.
These are troubled times for dictatorships, Mr President.
This violation of the international legal order is unacceptable.
We must put a stop to this.
The sum of USD 20 million has been mentioned.
These run into the hundreds in Palestine.
We must do more than simply condemn, however.
We certainly condemn them.
It is unfair and often perverse to do so.
We are however saddened by them.
Piracy and terrorism must be condemned too.
We consider ourselves friends of the Cuban people.
We understand them and are in solidarity with them.
I also believe it contains serious untruths.
These detract from its credibility.
It is unbalanced and therefore not useful.
It is in fact answerable to this House.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
But the dictator Fidel Castro has betrayed this!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place following this debate.
WRITTEN EXPLANATION (RULE 120)
Socialist Cuba is a thorn in their side.
These events are no isolated incidents.
Everything suggests that Egypt is not respecting these principles.
Do we listen?
No.
He was arrested, along with his friend.
He is now in prison.
He is awaiting appeal.
Of course not.
The regulations governing churches are very complicated and long-winded.
Evolution is possible therefore.
Relationships may be of whatever kind they deem appropriate.
Another 29 individuals were effectively cleared, however.
There is one piece of good news, however.
He is a human rights defender.
Those are the principles this Parliament must uphold.
Mr President, yet another resolution on Egypt.
It makes one wonder who is ruling Egypt?
Homosexuality remains a sensitive issue for Egyptian society.
I will now pass to other issues raised.
It is a rapidly evolving situation.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place now.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
That brings the day's business to an end.
I declare this session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 4.30 p.m.)
.
(ES) Europe is now almost reunited.
I therefore voted in favour of the Bayona report.
This is the case of Catalonia.
.
Resumption of the session
The following changes are proposed:
Tuesday
The reasons for this are very clear.
Mr President, this is about Wednesday.
Thursday
No legislative procedure is therefore required.
We therefore consider the question to be superfluous.
There are not enough MONUC soldiers.
Thus the violence continues to increase.
The Security Council should now speak out about this.
I am talking about breast cancer.
I am sure Ireland is not alone in this.
Thank you.
That is disgusting and shameful.
Baroness Ludford has already raised this matter.
What is happening?
That is all I can tell you.
I can tell you the facts of the matter.
The Spanish judiciary has banned them too.
There were no other conditions.
More than thirty people are reported dead.
(Protests from Mr Ortuondo Larrea)
I am not a magician!
You will have to speak tomorrow.
.
The title of this programme is self-explanatory.
Enough about 'stupid' energy.
Parliament will pursue that idea in other ways.
This programme will help.
As we know, Mrs McNally possibly wanted more.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Mrs McNally has come up with an interesting idea.
That is something this agency could do here.
The second point is about the budget.
We welcome this.
I think it would have helped us.
It involves heavy, ongoing investment.
We must look far into the future.
Demand will grow and fossil energies will decline.
As always, I can only register my disapproval.
Setting up new agencies does not increase administrative transparency.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Implementing this technology can also make supplies more secure.
I think that is a very fine achievement.
And why is all of this the case?
The remainder is sold on the network.
Congratulations, Commissioner.
We eventually succeeded in finding the compromise we sought.
My final note is one of caution.
There are a number of amendments tabled.
Common objectives are set very carelessly in the EU.
Let me turn to the definitions.
This definition is independent of climate zones.
Annex III defines the energy efficiency of cogeneration plants.
Cogeneration plays a very important role in this.
Amendment No 42 is essential.
I hope that it can.
They are concerned about this 50-megawatt threshold for eligibility.
That can come from a variety of sources.
I wish to raise two concerns of my own.
I would once again like to thank the rapporteur.
Nevertheless, there are 28 which we reject entirely.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Hopefully that confidence will return.
They do not have a problem with this.
There could be an added cost to them.
That is something we want to try to avoid.
I feel we have achieved this.
We have introduced three extra categories.
There are still some areas of concern.
We debated them in committee.
Mrs Foster brought forward a couple of amendments.
We should return to that at a later stage.
That certainly is not my intention.
I also met with the insurers.
There is very little competition in this field.
None of these concepts should make us nervous.
My group has tabled two amendments again for plenary.
That is a shame.
I broadly support the Commission's initiatives.
It is overstretched.
In a real, insured aeroplane.
This is what is important.
What do I mean by rigidity?
Mr Vermeer spoke of the issue of open skies.
These international agreements therefore clearly allow cover of overflights.
We are working on this at the moment.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
We have high expectations of its outcome.
We could also have purchased planes elsewhere.
The European Union's common space policy is important.
Quite the opposite.
We therefore consider that it should be implemented swiftly.
Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, good evening.
Why space, one might ask.
Do we have the money in the first place?
Let me show this by way of some examples.
That is the greatest and most important challenge.
It shows the widespread support.
We want a consolidated European space policy.
We do not want continuous, ad hoc structures.
We need a permanent solution.
The reasons are obvious.
There is considerable European added value in working together.
Otherwise we will lose them.
We have already heard about launchers and satellites.
Let us have space policy in the Convention.
It is an ideal area for the European Union.
I support the arguments in favour of Galileo.
We must not dawdle on this, however.
That is something that is very important to us.
Our credibility is at stake.
We must choose.
We must seek the most efficient location and headquarters.
That is what we must seek.
At any rate, we will make the attempt.
Thank you for that clarification.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
(The sitting was suspended at 9 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
There are several key issues that deserve special attention.
We have voted on these.
I would just like to briefly outline the background.
That is my position.
The first compromises I suggested were based on this.
Unfortunately we were not able to achieve that.
Unfortunately we were not able to achieve this.
I think that this violates the Aarhus Convention.
Our vote will not bring about immediate change.
We want stricter rules on environmental liability.
A further example is the directive's scope.
No, most certainly not!
Under no circumstances!
This minimum must be reached.
We must not allow this to happen.
We cannot afford to waste any more time.
What, then, does this Commission proposal achieve?
The second factor is the scope of the proposals.
This list of activities is very restrictive.
This is not acceptable.
This proposal is also suffering from this.
Insurance aspects are in particular being raised.
On the contrary.
'The polluter pays' should be the logical adage.
It works well, and it saves money.
The second example is that of GMOs.
However, we have been deceived.
This House must make changes.
I do not agree with altering the legal base.
None of this is very radical.
(Applause from the left)
There should be more prevention.
That is all I wanted to say to you.
This directive is vitally important.
The second question is that of maritime transport.
How is this regulated at the moment?
The same applies to liability for maritime transport.
This is very regrettable.
It is completely unacceptable.
Such 20th-century class warfare has no place today.
The two are complementary.
Fantasy solutions are as detrimental as pollution itself.
Will this proposed directive face up to the challenge?
We refuse to accept this.
Why am I not happy?
I doubt it somehow.
I have my doubts about this.
Then there is the definition of habitat.
This will now be reviewed after five years.
That is what this directive sets out to do.
Who will pick up the cost of that?
It will be the general public.
We cannot allow that to happen.
We must not allow that.
That is where compulsory car insurance comes in.
We must introduce exactly the same responsibilities for industry.
That is the core of the polluter pays principle.
It would genuinely undermine the Commission's actual proposal.
There is a need for important changes.
In Co.
This provides legal certainty.
This also represents a balance between different interests.
The directive does not apply retroactively.
It gives that very clear signal.
In that case, there has to be remediation.
We want to see an insurance system.
What about the scope?
That was the starting-point.
Is that something insurers will be happy to cover?
Would that be a manageable system?
Digging the foundations for a house would hurt worms.
Do we want that to be covered?
Is that reasonable?
We have to see it as a step-by-step approach.
For international activities, there should be international rules.
What about oil or marine pollution?
The polluter shall pay!
This is the only rule that can apply.
We have seen accident after accident.
This is not acceptable.
What about regulatory compliance and state-of-the-art and development risks?
Again, this is what will cover traditional damage.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
.
This is based on voluntariness.
Take the packaging covenant, for example.
It is a voluntary agreement.
The same goes for the PVC strategy.
The same applies to pedestrian safety.
I am in favour of a good environmental policy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
But it is normal practice.
That is something we find unacceptable.
The Commission proposal almost achieves that.
It comes very close to doing that.
I beg to disagree.
This is something I hope the Commission will welcome.
This is common sense.
Some implementing measures are discretionary, not obligatory.
I gather that is not a matter of controversy.
That is something that all should welcome.
That is not our point.
This power seems to us to be completely excessive.
We do not believe that this is acceptable.
Those are the two reservations that we have.
This is not exactly a straightforward subject.
That is the intention of Parliament's amendments.
Why are we doing this?
That too has already been mentioned.
We have to change this.
I believe that the Commissioner is wrong.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
A great deal remains to be done, however.
(Laughter and applause)
We shall therefore take a single vote.
I think that is clear to everyone.
Before the vote on the draft legislative resolution
.
(Laughter and applause)
... it is not as bad as it sounds!
(Parliament decided to defer the final vote)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
.
.
.
.
Sweden abolished these forms of aid some years ago.
We therefore have our doubts about reintroducing them.
.
.
I wish to highlight the importance:
.
.
.
.
.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
.
.
.
That is why we voted against the proposal.
.
It is of no greater value than self-regulation.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
They are summarised as follows:
rapid detection of all suspect cases through good surveillance,
As you quite rightly said.
This is an unknown virus.
This is something that we have to change.
What consequences did it have in the end?
Other countries are doing that.
There are countries that have introduced entry restrictions.
Why are we not doing so?
We do not know anything about the infection channels.
Is that as it should be?
That is not enough, however.
The European Centre has once again been mentioned.
Perhaps this is enough at this point.
That might have happened.
That could already have happened.
That could have happened to us.
What would we have done?
The problems are broader than this.
It is not just about SARS.
What should we do about these?
They can also not be healed with medicines afterwards.
There are only three ways of limiting the consequences.
The first is to limit the chance of infection.
The second method is not being given much thought.
In any case, we must have guidelines.
Why is that?
Take heed!
What are we doing now in Europe?
In Europe we have an internal market.
I am not one of them.
Is this too little too late?
We have no knowledge of any vaccines.
I regret that.
What do I see?
What security can I offer citizens now?
What must I now actually conclude?
They are needed more than ever.
The measures against SARS are inadequate.
Unfortunately no other conclusion is possible at the moment.
Confidence in the government is important.
This sort of attitude does not help anyone.
It simply passes around as it chooses.
The text in general was the result of compromise.
A great many topics were touched on.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
The debate is closed.
I am delighted to see them here in Strasbourg.
It is an absolute disgrace.
There are also important budgetary considerations.
It could be very expensive.
Let us not fool ourselves.
For me, information policy is of key importance.
However, this lacks ambition and innovation.
This is not just Parliament's role.
Where has this money gone?
That brings me to budgetary rigour.
We see no need for that.
It concerns the Association of Former Members.
This expenditure item is new.
The focus is the right one.
What is so wrong with it?
All this is absurd.
Then there is the question of heading 3.
The workload for each language must be divided proportionally.
Any overcapacity must be scrapped or redistributed.
What does it involve?
Our institution respects the principle of public debate.
Moreover, the House is half-full today.
What are we asking?
Why should our Parliamentary committees not also do this?
It is not very expensive.
The second was necessary institutional reforms.
We have no greater challenge than this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The 2004 Budget is a truly historic one.
For the first time it covers 25 Member States.
This presents a particular challenge for the budget.
The funds are available for this.
Thank you very much!
The Parliament had sought an austerity budget.
So in this regard they have remained the same.
It may come later.
They are not being increased very much.
There is still an enormous amount as yet unpaid.
What relationship does it bear?
This too is an issue for Parliament.
Perhaps Europe will have to do something about it.
No mention has yet been made of Iraq.
This we shall also have to discuss.
It cannot come from Berlaymont alone.
This too we shall examine critically.
Who knows?!
That concludes the item.
It is not just energy.
That is the first step.
Are they interested in such a solution?
Perhaps you could say something further on the subject.
Yes, they do have a great interest.
That concludes the item.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
I imagine there is no problem with this.
It will make the order more logical.
Part I
Subject: Storm of 11-12 April 2003 in the Azores
Subject: Discharges of oil in Gibraltar
ESPart II
Subject: Commission disciplinary procedure
When were disciplinary proceedings started?
At what stage are these disciplinary proceedings?
Questions to Commissioner Nielson
I am grateful to the honourable Member.
A little more than twenty minutes.
Subject: Drinking water in developing countries and industrialised countries
What steps has it already taken?
Mr Posselt is absolutely right.
Oil is not the only resource in that country.
Subject: Reproductive health
Can the Commission rule this out with absolute certainty?
The Commission's policy on abortion is clear.
This is what I find most important.
Subject: Angola: current situation and outlook for democracy
Everything seemed relatively well organised.
Difficult, but all right.
However, we should not rest on our laurels.
We must therefore pay the utmost attention to them.
Have there been any developments?
The Commission supports the UK initiative.
It is absolutely necessary to discuss this with Angola.
I agree that the elections are the big test.
Subject: Convention on the Future of Europe
I certainly welcome what you say about Article 35.
Mrs Kinnock's remark is important.
This is reality.
The point about governance and democracy is also true.
This is another aspect we have to work on.
Questions to Commissioner Schreyer
This is the global figure.
This is now an ongoing effort.
The timetable is also part of the issue.
Delegations, DG-Development and AIDCO.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We thank you for your cooperation.
In any event, Mr Alavanos has the floor.
Mr President, these are oral questions.
We still have 10 minutes left.
The first question is my question.
Three Members will take the floor.
That is how the order is decided.
Mrs Ahern has the floor.
Excuse me.
Mrs Schreyer?
Mrs Ahern, please put your question.
Abortion rates in Ireland were referred to.
Can Mrs Schreyer confirm that?
I have nothing to ask the Commissioner.
It was an internal point of order.
Why do they appear in the document?
So that they can be answered in writing.
That is why they are there.
You witnessed that just as I did.
Thank you.
Further reforms are on the way, moreover.
This is unacceptable.
This is not the case.
Is that, I ask you, democracy?
Is that freedom of opinion?
The list could go on and on.
This is where we might bear Cyprus in mind.
That is not the situation.
Sadly, that is now the case.
What conclusions can we draw from this?
That is how life is lived there.
Thank you very much, Mr Korakas.
Cooperatives are an important part of that social economy.
The Council has ignored that warning in this case.
This is something that we must not tolerate.
I take the same view.
All contributions must constitute an ongoing process.
We cannot now wait any longer for this Statute.
I was a Member of this Parliament in 1993.
Really this should be a reason for great joy.
This we have always supported.
That cannot be denied.
The problem is that the Council never learns.
At the first opportunity it abuses its position again!
The Council can simply adopt our amendments.
This I find quite proper.
The Commission learns with difficulty.
The Council never learns.
This Parliament learns, but not always.
Like others I regret the legal base chosen.
I shall cite just a few.
Some of these resolutions are very significant.
This provides extremely valuable employment indeed.
The principles in supporting this directive are clear.
This entire package has taken far too long.
The outcome from virtually all sides has been satisfactory.
We have reached a satisfactory outcome for all concerned.
I commend the proposal to the House.
Thank you, Mr RÃ¼big.
The debate is closed.
On the contrary.
We are talking about added value at Brussels level.
This is the situation we must now address.
In my view, there are three specific issues.
The first is the environmental impact.
A second aspect is the link with regional policy.
The third link is transport policy.
That distorts the competition among them.
Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.06 p.m.)
Situation in Iraq
The minister should be here in a few minutes.
I hope this will be a transitional challenge.
However, it is a complicated operation.
They are very different.
Our ties with the region are already very important.
The presence of violence is strong everywhere.
Today, we face a new situation in Iraq.
A third issue relates to developments in trans-Atlantic relations.
The President-in-Office was right to refer to Chechnya.
Let me add a further point.
Now let me turn to Iraq.
(Applause)
We must seize this opportunity now.
(Applause)
We Europeans have responsibilities here.
Why?
This is an absolutely essential issue.
In any event, my group is ready.
It is not right and nor is it smart.
Did you hear anything in that line?
I did not.
Of course there are great hurdles to overcome.
That is not in dispute.
It is time for some straight talking.
New and divisive structures are not needed.
What we need is increased capability.
(Applause)
Mr President, I visited Iraq 12 days ago.
I listened to the people.
The people are relishing their freedom.
It is early days.
Mr President, we cannot shirk our responsibilities.
I do not know what we are surprised about.
The food stocks of Iraqi families are totally exhausted.
Prolonging the current situation is therefore especially dangerous.
Its contribution totals EUR 964 million.
The figure for ECHO is EUR 100 million.
Then there are the figures for other countries.
We have to help promote stability in the region.
Syria is part of the Euro-Mediterranean Association.
Secondly, I feel sorry for the European Parliament.
What did we do doing the war?
What did we do after the war?
They are occupying forces.
It sets a very dangerous precedent.
That is clear.
As we all know, that is highly unlikely.
This is a war crime in my eyes.
Now that education system has been completely decimated.
It is a disgrace!
It is a disgrace!
We owe them our solidarity.
So how do things look now?
The United States tolerates other dictatorships around the world.
Wars are not fought about those.
No such weapons have been found, however.
Spain has been sidelined.
Not a single prohibited weapon has been found.
The United Nations has not failed.
In all events, today we face political premises.
However, there have to be certain principles.
What are they?
There is no way out of this.
The European Union has to address this issue.
This is of the utmost importance.
We are talking about war and peace.
I value the transatlantic relationship.
Mine have not changed.
Yet this is still not enough.
We have to face up to the truth.
The truth is that we have grown apart.
We must begin to rebuild that relationship.
We have far too great a common bond.
We share common values.
Those are natural disagreements, which we can have.
Where was his loyal cooperation?
Do you not agree that such disloyalty is reprehensible?
There are important gaps here which need answers.
A lot of inspiration is needed.
To do this an honest broker is needed.
I am not going to restart the debate.
The Commissioner can reply if he wishes.
It was a member of OPEC.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENTS (RULE 120)
.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament approved the joint text)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
After the vote:
That is quite clear.
Thank you for pointing that out.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
We will now continue with the vote.
Before the vote on Amendments Nos 85 and 99:
In Amendment No 99, it is.
They are the same.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
Lastly, I wish to highlight:
c) gender balance.
.
It is therefore appropriate to remove this clause.
.
.
.
.
I do not think so.
.
.
.
.
.
I would highlight the recent example of the Prestige.
.
.
.
.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
The Bilderberg meeting is starting at the weekend.
These negotiations are now in their final stage.
They will exist alongside bilateral agreements.
It remains outstanding.
As I understand it, it will.
Will this agreement reinforce the European Judicial Area?
The third issue relates to procedure.
This allowed Parliament to consider its contents.
An important precedent has been set.
I will move on to outline the negative aspect.
In our opinion this is unacceptable.
Thank you very much for being here today.
I would welcome further clarification on this matter.
I will now outline my second question.
It provides for the International Criminal Court to prevail.
I firmly believe it is not.
We need a robust and effective response.
Yet these proposals cover the whole Palermo agenda.
I would urge the Council to rectify this.
The European Union must guard against it.
Do not let the Council's haste facilitate it.
Ask the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay.
This provides an opening for further negotiations.
In any event I have some specific questions.
Have the candidate countries been consulted?
This proposal does after all affect them too.
We do not have this information.
First as regards the extradition treaty.
Is Miami Vice about to arrive in Europe?
I find this nothing short of scandalous.
Is this request also supported by Member States?
I shall try and reply to these concerns.
The EU-USA agreements will bring added value.
That is what we want.
Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
That brings me to common economic values.
Fourth element: close cooperation in the energy sector.
Fifth element: adequate criteria for progress with reforms.
Thank you for listening.
Where do we stand at present with this project?
On that particular point I think you are wrong.
This is urgent.
The logic of force is persisting after the war.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This represents an enormous shortcoming in the communication.
This ambiguity must be clarified.
Doom and gloom.
That was what it boiled down to.
It looks remarkably like the expansion process.
Naturally I warmly welcome the latter news.
I can imagine that there are such countries.
Each of them has significant political and economic problems.
A new financial instrument must be developed for cooperation.
They are therefore not foreign to Europe.
Geography is another issue that we need to discuss.
We must respond positively to these expectations.
Thus, each person has their borders in mind.
They are also neighbours and friends.
The challenges are not over yet, however.
Mr President, I welcome the Commission communication.
Their agendas really are too different.
That should be clear.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
It will appear in the Minutes.
The debate is closed.
Its political system presents a similar picture.
There has been another such attack today.
I am grateful that the President-in-Office commented on Chechnya.
We do not see it that way.
I should like therefore to begin with the latter.
This question is still hanging over the market somewhat.
Can we exert any influence?
If so, in what way?
I have a question on this point.
That strikes me as an excellent first step.
That has been apparent in the past.
It is the most recent example of that.
Russia must put the Investments Protection Agreement in order.
This makes political efforts by both sides particularly important.
That is not acceptable.
Not least by Russian politicians and Russian citizens themselves.
And not only because of wider geographical repercussions?
That is the reality today.
We do not need any new organisations.
We have had success with the MNEPR.
I should like to refer to Kaliningrad.
These are not issues that can proceed quickly.
I specifically asked for that.
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
Council Directive 1999/70/EC
You clearly heard the Council's response.
Mr Nogueira has the floor for a supplementary question.
I am forced to remind you of this.
There are no points of order.
Question No 3 lapses.
Subject: Reforming the Dayton Agreement
I have nothing to say.
Restricting bureaucracy may be a problem.
Subject: European corporate tax reform policy
I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
We can examine it and give a written answer.
Subject: Cotonou Agreement and Council priorities
When you are illiterate that is impossible.
That is where the emphasis should be.
I have noted the member's comment.
Subject: WTO and agriculture deadline
Subject: Closure of Calder Hall Magnox reactor in Sellafield
Subject: European Rural Model
I thank the President-in-Office for that comprehensive reply.
I shall bear the comments expressed in mind.
Subject: Women in Afghanistan and Iraq
This is a problem in western Afghanistan.
Subject: Cuba: policy review
The Council will keep the situation under close review.'
(Applause)
That started in a shipyard in Poland.
(Applause)
(Laughter)
(Applause)
That concludes the formal sitting.
(The formal sitting closed at 12.30 p.m.)
This point has not yet been satisfactorily resolved.
That does mean, though, an increased risk.
There are a number of important questions.
How are we to deal with this?
We urge the Commission to achieve this through negotiation.
The culls have brought heartbreak to countless families.
Once again he has done an excellent job.
Meanwhile we are engaged in a legislative process.
The first concerns political responsibility.
Confidence in politics suffered a severe dent.
This buck-passing game has backfired badly on Europe.
Responsibilities for choices and compliance must be clearly established.
It is our task to communicate on this matter.
On the first point: better border controls.
What exactly were the new measures?
We went even further.
It could extend to all infectious animal diseases.
We are constantly given different explanations.
It will happen.
But it still has not happened.
I should like to know why.
That strikes me as a huge problem.
There was sufficiency leeway in the agriculture budget.
In that respect the Commission did do its work.
It must be put on a sound financial footing.
It should not be permitted by this directive.
The EU's animal disease policy requires re-evaluation.
Since then we have learned the hard way.
I did not dare to count on preventive vaccination.
This makes preventive vaccination the option for the future.
It is not a public health problem.
This is the second report.
We must not rule out the use of slaughter.
Finally, we must not become complacent.
He was considerate, courteous and thorough.
These arguments will move with the science.
We are right to prioritise the research needed.
The epidemic moved with terrifying speed.
It was awful to see that speed.
Movement restrictions were not effective in the early stages.
They traumatised whole communities.
He has shown that.
The EU has become a single veterinary zone.
Denmark has lost its independent veterinary status.
I declare an interest in the equestrian area.
A fast response is of critical importance.
Containment saves the situation considerably.
That responsibility rests with the Member States.
It is a matter for the free market.
Work has been done and a report is anticipated.
Mr Whitehead asked me about research on vaccines.
When will it start?
Public tenders have gone out.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
The need for capacity building is accepted everywhere.
This problem is being addressed.
I conclude by once again thanking the rapporteur.
Sixteen would own a telephone.
Besides wealth we should also be speaking about power.
In my country there were elections in March.
This means compliance with certain minimum basic health standards.
Individual capacity-building through education is the ultimate capacity-building system.
Thank you very much, Mrs Junker.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
That is a significant and important start.
I appreciate that very much.
It is a success for us all.
This has been a missing element.
This is in respect of the reality of ownership.
The poor have no access at all to training.
There are also too many programmes.
New difficulties have arisen in some countries.
These are all complex and interrelated issues.
Of course, macroeconomic support is important.
I know he will be thinking that.
So what is the situation?
We have a long road ahead of us.
No!
It happens through education.
We have already seen this in Europe.
But it is a long road.
I have, despite this, three further observations.
The financial consequences are not properly set out.
The financing needed is EUR 8 billion per year.
That is the key to development.
It is a question of priorities.
We also congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work.
Education - I repeat - must be our priority.
The water initiative is one other such case.
Therefore they are excluded from the system.
That is quite tough!
This is an important point.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Do you know who wrote the script?
No?
Shame on you!
Do you know who composed the music for it?
That neither!
Do you know who directed it?
Perhaps someone can remember?
No, they cannot.
Hmm.
Why?
What is the Commission going to do then?
On this I agree absolutely with Mrs Hieronymi.
This is, primarily, about their moral rights.
May the exercise be a success!
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Broad economic policy guidelines (2003-2005)
These are therefore no ordinary economic guidelines.
We have achieved this.
We have two proposals in this regard.
That is what coordination is about.
Monetary policy has worked well during this period.
This policy is aimed at achieving price stability.
Some States have gone significantly astray.
The Commission has to verify that budgets are balanced.
You cannot have your cake and eat it.
We advocate increasing labour mobility.
We appeal for social dialogue.
Under investment occurs in the private sector.
We just need to know how things stand.
Clearly, we are launching a new venture.
It differs substantially from our activities in previous years.
We believe these changes are crucial.
It alleges they are not sufficiently ambitious.
In my opinion this criticism is not justified.
Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil emphasised this.
We fully agree on the need to increase employment.
We think the latter is the best option.
You asked two questions.
Establishing another new plan would not resolve the problems.
We believe we already have the plans.
We know what we need to do.
You queried whether or not this is sufficient.
I think we share your disquiet.
Clearly, implementation is behind schedule.
Political will is essential for this.
So too is Parliament's support.
Why do we need new economic policy guidelines?
Reform is needed to guarantee pensions and associated benefits.
The first was failure to attain the Lisbon objectives.
Action on these is certainly needed.
Another is failure to adopt technological innovation.
Research and development is not being promoted adequately either.
This is happening at the moment.
We cannot afford to restrict or weaken it.
Instead, the economic perspective will totally dominate.
Today, the situation is different.
We have not managed to do this.
Both have pledged this in writing.
Alongside this, entrepreneurship should be stimulated.
We should like to maintain this equality.
This is the subject of political debate.
I very much welcome this.
I indicated that the promises were very rarely kept.
First of all, social policy.
The first is pension provision.
Another point: immigration.
I quote in English:
I reiterate: this cannot be the way forward.
Madam President, chance occasionally organises things rather well.
It concerns salaries.
In particular, wage developments should remain moderate.'
Potion number 6: review labour market regulations.
They should seek quality, not quantity.'
Responsibility for this failure is shared.
I share this view.
I should like to mention a few points.
Europe must distribute the burdens more fairly.
This issue has already been addressed on numerous occasions.
I have written to these Commissioners.
Unfortunately, your answer was not specific enough.
I appreciate the problems it is up against.
Sadly, one was not possible.
I appreciate how little time Parliament has available.
The Council and the Commission are under similar constraints.
Monetary policy has changed, obviously.
I shall return to this point later.
This is not the case.
It provides for an appropriate and flexible fiscal policy.
It focused on detail and veered towards caricature.
Nothing could be further from reality.
Wages are always set in relation to productivity.
All the information is therefore available.
This is obviously a crucial point.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
I am now speaking on behalf of my group.
It will render its positions clearer and more public.
Monetary policy is handled by the independent Central Bank.
Budgetary policies must be consistent across the Union too.
I referred earlier to wages policies.
Who is this lady?
Nor is she a token woman.
Thank you, Mr RÃ¼big.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon
We shall proceed to the vote shortly.
The next item is voting time.
I see absolutely no objective reason to postpone it.
I put the matter to the House.
(Parliament decided to postpone the vote)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote
The House has decided, Mr Posselt.
It is incorrect.
That is all.
That concludes voting time.
.
That is why we have abstained from voting.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Why did I abstain, then?
Egunkaria is merely a newspaper.
That is why I abstained.
.
.
Several thousand Russian soldiers voted.
.
Nothing is said about foreign debt.
.
The rapporteur himself admits this.
.
.
.
That would be a mistake.
.
Is it the tragic situation of certain population groups?
Is it the increasing poverty?
Not at all!
It will have to do without our support.
We voted against this report.
The report as a whole is sound.
.
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr Posselt has the floor.
Mr Wieland has the floor.
Who is making the decisions here?
I therefore fully support Mr Posselt on this issue.
Mr Korakas has the floor.
This attack is not the first.
These obstacles are deliberate.
Mr Schmitt had previously consulted the President.
(The Minutes were approved)
I wish him well in Sunday's elections.
This mechanical excavation work would certainly cost 20 billion.
This worked well then.
Surely we wanted a dynamic Europe?
Thank you very much Mr Vermeer.
.
The Commission is at present still evaluating this question.
We need codecision.
The age pyramid is turning on its head.
That is not competition.
That is not customer-friendly conduct.
We must learn to call a spade a spade.
Yet this is inevitable.
What would that mean?
Nothing is clear!
The debate will definitely continue.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The last shred of civilisation has left Congo.
How does the international community respond?
This must stop at all costs.
We certainly do not only need French soldiers.
The European Union must insist on this.
Similar problems are delaying the formation of a Parliament.
This must however remain a United Nations mission.
French troops must also abide by the MONUC mandate.
It has enormous human resources at its disposal.
Hundreds of people have been injured.
We are trying to encourage democracy in these countries.
We seem to turn a blind eye to this.
I have been an MEP now for four years.
I have lived in Africa for many years.
It has to be the other way round.
We must act.
We must ask ourselves one question.
Why are Europe and the world looking away?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, I join in the chorus.
That change is to be welcomed.
Cooperation is the politics of the future.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place after the debates.
I genuinely wish to assent to this resolution.
Information is being deliberately suppressed on a massive scale.
The security services are extremely active in those areas.
Soldiers are also billeted with the villagers.
Nonetheless, there are still some very worrying developments.
We are not interfering in Vietnam's internal affairs.
That is not our responsibility.
They know exactly what our positions are.
That is what this House demands.
Mr President, Mr Nassauer is absolutely right.
We are talking about fundamental and universal human rights.
Many thanks to all those Members.
This was a first.
Their meeting was broadcast on Vietnamese television.
I believe that this is an extremely important element.
Nevertheless, this small light has been lit.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place after the debates.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Resumption of the session
The vote is scheduled for Wednesday at 12 noon.
Thank you.
The point which you raise is perfectly correct.
The following changes have been proposed:
Wednesday
motions for resolutions: 12 noon on Thursday 12 June
Can we not invite him?
This is a serious matter.
I can only offer you the facts.
The order of business was thus established.
They are also being deported from Germany and Belgium.
I should be grateful to you for your intervention.
I will take up the matter, Mrs Maes.
Thank you for raising it.
Could we not get something done to improve it?
Both matters are worth examining.
This must apply everywhere, the Basque country included.
The debate is closed.
There is a similar situation as regards primary law.
It found that too much of a hot potato.
That is what the Statute is for!
That is what it is about!
(Applause)
(Laughter)
That is what this Statute is about!
(Applause)
(Applause)
.
That, though, makes no sense.
That shows how old this law is.
This issue calls for new law.
This is something on which the Bureau will decide.
(Applause)
I believe it should be adopted in plenary.
Mr Lehne has referred to them.
That is what we are currently addressing.
It is not a simple decision on remuneration.
Surely this is the point.
This is our last chance.
The turnout in every single election has been low.
So we have got this wrong.
Transparency in expenses is essential.
That is what is most important.
That is the right course to follow.
In my opinion, that is very true.
This contamination makes the negotiations too difficult.
That is a considerable step forward.
That cannot be the intention ... can it?
This Parliament has been directly elected for twenty-four years.
This, therefore, is not acceptable.
There is a fly in the ointment, however.
The chance of that ever happening is very small.
That is unacceptable to many Members, myself included.
Unfortunately, that is not the case.
They demand answers from us.
We invite you to join us in supporting it.
The debate is closed.
4 recommendations for second reading:
What did Parliament and the rapporteurs try to achieve?
What have we achieved?
Innovation will not come from dinosaurs.
We need ownership unbundling.
We need ring-fencing of the decommissioning funds.
The games must stop.
I think this is a good result.
My third point is, therefore, indisputable.
The Committee officially withdrew them.
These directives make these quite explicit.
It is like an election.
Both these options are still under consideration.
I will see to it that this is done.
Fine.
Let us focus on a couple of points.
My colleague Mr Mombaur also pointed this out earlier.
This is the way it should be, too.
That will be the crux of the matter.
Electricity is a sector which requires long-term investment.
I have just spoken to him.
My group will vote in favour of this tomorrow.
There will be new Iraq oil wars.
We risked this acceleration and creation of cartels.
The reason is obvious.
Liberalisation must be continued and the network improved.
Achieving this compromise has not been easy.
This is definitely a step in the right direction.
The market mechanisms have been working perfectly.
What comes next?
That is the question.
Transposing this directive into law will not be straightforward.
We have not achieved all we want.
However, those earlier directives were inadequate.
Types of energy choices can be affected, however.
We need to look at that.
The risks are to research.
It is an important move forward.
Parliament appears to be disregarding this concern.
Why is it to their advantage?
The energy market is different from other markets.
They will favour short-term vision and calculations.
Basically, competition needs to be developed further.
Some Members want to force this.
We are not capable of securing development investment.
Do the gains offset the costs?
What are the gains?
And the disadvantages?
All the transaction costs and lack of security.
I would say, no, it does not.
I would say that it does.
Reconsideration of this is necessary and appropriate.
It is something that we have to change.
Thirdly, I would like to have something clarified.
.
I agree.
Why do we need to establish trans-European networks?
Thank you very much, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
.
.
Let me address a couple more aspects.
We had three proposed amendments.
We wanted a five-year waiting period to 2008.
Be that as it may.
Those are the problems we have to face.
.
We are also trying to improve Parliament's reputation.
In short, see recital 5a.
This is waste management.
If only they were, Commissioner.
Increasing maritime safety involves financial costs.
What is a dirty vessel?
I think that we have succeeded in this.
I have two further remarks.
The first of these relates to shipbuilding.
The European shipbuilding sector is doing particularly badly.
The Commission can present proposals on this.
.
That is now crystal clear.
That is a good result.
Amendment No 7 refers to the shipbuilding industry.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
Regional trade agreements are not uniform.
FTAs should be based on the rule of reciprocity.
Regional integration is the backbone of the European Union.
I know the Commission has some reservations on this.
.
No.
We have as it were moved on a generation.
That is what we are providing at multilateral level.
Are we entirely in agreement then?
Not quite.
Let me add a few observations.
We approve.
.
Experience has shown this.
This is a fascinating debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
It does not currently have one, however.
Which legal basis constitutes the required solid legal basis?
b) decision-making procedure based on codecision.
The 'complementarity' criterion invites three comments.
That explains the current situation.
Reform is sought in this area.
The Commission should promptly propose such measures.
It is for exceptional crisis situations.
The 2001 report is an interesting one.
Once again I thank the rapporteur.
What is going on?
Possibly!
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
.
Secondly, the comitology has been simplified.
A methodological guide was published in March 2002.
.
So much for the political issues.
That is a good thing.
.
The report was presented in March 2003.
The new situation gives rise to new questions.
What is happening about South-South cooperation or interregional cooperation?
Otherwise we will only achieve unbalanced representation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 10.20 p.m.)
Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States
.
What are the main elements of reform?
Firstly, stability.
I now turn to the new priorities.
We must fully integrate immigrants into the labour market.
We must transform undeclared work into regular employment.
Let me now address the views of this Parliament.
First of all, a reference to reducing unemployment.
This proposal has been taken on board.
The discussions on governance were rather difficult.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
We have therefore put forward a range of proposals.
Firstly, we have proposed increased attention to unemployment.
That is not the same as combating unemployment.
There has therefore been a considerable lack of efficiency.
They will then have Parliament's support.
I am therefore opposed to Amendment No 62.
Another disagreement concerns tax policy.
There are quite a few amendments about this.
They are interesting, but very drastic.
Employment policy is important on the whole.
We fully agree with this strategy.
Allow me to say something about the overarching objectives.
We have abandoned the pillar structure.
Another objective is work of good quality.
A third important issue is integration.
That is important.
Allow me briefly to say something about the disagreement.
We need to resolve this in the committee.
The fact is, it is not.
His report has our broad support.
That said, we have some concerns.
Are they fully compatible with sound public finance?
We prefer our own Amendment No 58.
But this should simply be the norm.
The present situation, however, demanded much more.
That would be a tremendously damaging blow.
They are placing considerable emphasis on that point.
I hope the group will pull back.
It is simply not worth it.
There was a need for this.
The first is an action plan against unemployment.
These areas are:
Recruitment of immigrant workers should be done selectively.
The amendments adopted in committee are along these lines.
I feel these are tangible goals.
Social cohesion was to increase.
Then there are the policies on equal opportunities.
They are in a good position to identify needs.
Amendment No 9 is also important.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Military tribunals are an example of the latter.
Existing arrangements between Member States should therefore take precedence.
The European arrest warrant is a good example.
.
Mr President, this is indeed a significant agreement.
A precedent is being set.
I believe Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar has done good work.
The reservation on extradition is therefore quite clear.
The same is true of other European states.
I find the situation quite unacceptable.
Habeas corpus really is a basic right.
It is enshrined in all the conventions.
No adequate explanation has been given.
That is the question asked by this report.
It has not been an easy task.
Nobody would dispute that.
Mr CoÃ»teaux a few minutes ago echoed these ideas.
That is partly due to the procedure followed.
The fault for this lies entirely with Europe.
Who is extradited?
Mrs Buitenweg went into detail about that.
Then there is the point about GuantÃ¡namo.
Something really has to be done about this.
Is this a milestone, then?
Not yet.
Definitely not.
Can we sink any deeper?
There certainly will be scrutiny, therefore.
I would like to ask two questions.
Why?
.
I shall begin with Article 13.
I shall try to make myself clear.
Therein lies the problem.
It does not exist.
Finally, on the matter of special courts.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
.
It also supplements the directive on family reunification.
Students enjoy ever-greater mobility.
I therefore share the concern expressed by the rapporteur.
This is stated in the Commission's proposal.
The latter could then set up illegal immigration networks.
The centres need to be properly equipped too.
That is the usual length of an academic year
I am not opposed to the idea.
I believe this proposal is very helpful.
We recognise that reasonable restrictions are required.
That is probably even more important.
The proposal needs to be fast-tracked through the Council.
Mrs Roure deserves to be congratulated on her work.
Sadly, we are far from achieving this.
Mr President, this is a very timely report.
I congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
The concerns are specific to the United Kingdom.
In general the report is balanced and sensible.
.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
(Mixed reaction)
I welcome this.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote on the proposal for a recommendation:
This is noted also in the voting list.
Mr President, this is about the Stability Pact.
We had a long discussion between the groups yesterday.
(Applause)
The services are aware of the problem.
The texts will all be aligned with each other.
Before the vote on Amendment No 10:
Before the vote on Amendment No 23:
I shall therefore vote against it.
We now have a majority.
.
Of course, we did not support it.
.
.
.
The democrats will appreciate this?
.
The rapporteur's vision is centralist rather than federalist.
I put the question to the House.
.
.
The proposal contains many positive features.
We do not share this view.
That is why we are abstaining on this point.
.
.
The term employment policy is completely misleading.
.
The same applies to labour market policy.
.
We want more jobs, but also better-adapted jobs.
The fight against poverty is key.
It is a matter of solidarity.
The objectives we set must be accessible.
.
.
We are sorry that this amendment was not adopted.
I think that Parliament?
(The President cut off the speaker)
.
Article 27.
.
.
.
Members of the EP are elected in national constituencies.
This is a vision that we do not share.
Hence our vote against the report.
.
The amount of remuneration is a matter of dispute.
.
The EU's enlargement must not affect political diversity.
.
.
.
.
.
That is why I voted against this draft statute.
.
.
.
But what of peoples' access to basic rights?
.
What is the point of these words?
Hence my vote against the report.
.
.
I therefore voted against the report.
.
.
.
.
(PT) I voted for this excellent report.
Strengthening political stability and democracy; 2.
Creating a free trade area; 3.
Attaching priority to the social and cultural spheres.
.
But that is far from being a perfect solution.
We see here the consequences of badly negotiated treaties.
.
.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
.
That reduces prices on the world market.
We insist upon food safety and quality.
We demand worker protection.
Prevention is better than cure.
That is something we Europeans should also appreciate.
What are the Commission's proposals, in fact?
Then, the abolition of monthly increments.
So why shouldn't we do the same?
None of this appears in the Commission's proposal.
This is unfair.
This is then transferred to the market management system.
I refer to private storage.
The latter will not work.
There does not appear to be agreement, however.
The task before us seemed almost beyond our capacities.
The 50 cents proposed are definitely inadequate.
Another key element of this reform is modulation.
In June I applauded and supported it.
That is not true.
That is not fair, Commissioner.
The first is decoupling.
This is without doubt the core of reform.
Second issue: modulation.
The third issue is cross-compliance.
.
This model is our programme.
I am therefore convinced that this proposal makes sense.
.
The Commission advocates simplification.
The spectrum extends from outright rejection to qualified approval.
The difference is, in itself, marginal.
That is something with which we agree.
In my opinion, decoupling is ethically unacceptable.
Even the United States has abandoned the idea.
That should give us some food for thought.
What is happening as regards the transfer of rights?
Perhaps I will be in luck today.
The studies were launched very late in the day.
Commissioner, your proposal fills farmers with despair.
You have been utterly deaf to their requests.
The CAP is now 40 years old.
The CAP is only funded until 2012.
The milk quotas stop around 2013-2014.
I shall close on the issue of cross compliance.
Thank you, President-in-Office of the Council.
(Restrained applause)
Commissioner, in Finland rye is very special.
We should all be clear about this.
The work before us has not always been easy.
Decoupling is also a complicated area.
Even here the Commission is very restrained and cautious.
The cutbacks must also create better conditions for livestock.
All have been under enormous pressure of time.
This is not always the case in this House.
The second exception should apply to potato starch.
They are very vague.
Such a situation is totally unsustainable.
Commissioner Fischler proposes decoupling aid and production.
That way, he is overshooting the goal.
Should we repeat this mistake?
Why?
However, we do have a number of concerns.
We shall continue to fight to achieve these aims.
The time we were allotted was very short.
Is this or is this not a profound injustice?
I challenge your conscience with this injustice.
Next, Commissioner, your policy is discriminatory!
I call that discriminatory, Commissioner!
Why have you abandoned the ceiling, Commissioner?
Their markets are far from being saturated.
They need incentives to help develop their farms.
The Commission and the Council must now shoulder theirs.
Let us have total decoupling.
That is perhaps partly behind the Commissioner's principles.
I have a question for the Council.
The fruit and vegetable problems are great.
The Commissioner mentioned this very briefly.
I hope he can confirm what he said.
That will not work.
It is not fair.
That does not begin to solve the problem.
We must look into that.
We should also give some thought to that.
First of all, there is set-aside.
It is a cheap form of armchair socialism.
We are worried.
Beware of the various menus on decoupling!
Beware of partial decoupling proposals!
Buyer beware!
In fact, the contrary is the clear message.
There is little chance.
They must be looked after.
We should really use this negotiation capital.
(Applause)
It will also help us face up to enlargement.
.
This has been demonstrated again recently by the OECD.
We should therefore be very careful here.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I
Subject: Measures to combat the deadly SARS virus
.
Subject: Violation of human rights in Cuba
These conditions are clearly a violation of human rights.
Part 2
Question addressed to Mr Monti
.
.
.
Subject: Parallel trade
.
.
The assessment under Article 82 is ongoing.
.
Questions to Mrs Reding
Subject: Minority languages
Member States are supporting minorities in the accession countries.
.
.
.
That is one point.
Subject: Violence at football grounds
However, it is not the case with Catalonia.
.
The honourable Member is right.
Subject: Article on sport in the future Treaty
Sport is therefore added.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
A World Anti-Doping Agency code is not enough.
Could the Commissioner take steps in this direction?
.
We are responsible for the labelling of medicinal products.
That is fine by me.
.
Has France banned rugby?
That is news to me.
It should not be a social problem itself.
Thank you very much for your cooperation, Commissioner.
Questions to Mrs Diamantopoulou
There is legal chaos in Greece.
Subject: EU senior citizens' card
They are consumers.
It is a nice idea.
It has not changed.
Subject: Youth unemployment
Have specific projects already been drawn up?
Usually, it is the youngest workers who move.
This is the 5 + 2 rule.
You specifically raised the issue of school drop-outs.
That is genuinely very important for youth employment opportunities.
.
I am not at all ready to say adieu.
Young immigrants are always an asset.
Is this feasible?
.
.
.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, the formal sitting is closed.
.
(SV) Thank you, Mr President.
To date, 49 countries have ratified the protocol.
.
.
The package consists of Amendment Nos 19-26.
So the Commission can accept Amendment No 19.
Here, practicability must be the key imperative.
The ratifications will bring the protocol into force.
I welcome that.
It is an excellent step forward.
This is a pragmatic and sensible way forward.
This regulation is a great success.
I think that is absolutely crucial.
The common position is also a great success.
The debate is closed.
.
We worked well together.
Acidification is still a major problem.
How do we arrive at this 0.5% threshold?
This is indeed ambitious.
Such a system of emissions trading is cheaper.
This aspect should also be taken into consideration.
We can visualise this in very practical terms.
There is clearly something wrong here, technically speaking.
There is clearly a great deal of potential here.
The aim is to reduce emissions.
Low-sulphur fuel is of course more expensive.
So of course we export to the third world.
We have worked openly and constructively.
That is how we must work together.
The overall effects need to be looked at.
.
Shipping is a global industry.
The second issue concerns emissions offsetting, or trading.
Trading is not permitted under MARPOL Annex VI.
The last issue relates to requirements on the Commission.
You know how sensitive we are to these things.
In each case we would propose an alternative wording.
Thank you Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
I disagree.
I seek full support for their inclusion tomorrow.
I hope that this omission can be corrected.
If they go, the whole industry will collapse.
Let us be quite clear about this.
That is why it is a conservation zone.
We cannot allow this to happen.
I support my Spanish colleagues in many ways.
For example, the Mediterranean is completely disregarded.
Another key aspect is job losses.
One last point, on the subject of women.
.
I will turn to Mr Hudghton's report first.
.
There is a reason for this.
These are tough times, of course.
This cannot be called discrimination between states.
There is a lot of hypocrisy here.
It is not a political one.
I concur with the people of Ireland.
We must ask why.
Tomorrow it will be the Shetland waters.
After that, God only knows.
We support Mr Hudghton's report.
They are two principles which the Commission must accept.
We have scrupulous respect for the conservation measures.
This must be made absolutely clear.
These sensitive areas must therefore be sensitive.
The conservation measures must therefore affect everybody.
This sensitive biological area deserves protection.
This is not about discrimination.
Far from it.
Help is urgently needed.
An excellent message indeed.
We are not in a transitional period!
This is completely unacceptable.
I have no difficulty with the other two.
They are allowed in there at the moment.
There is no discrimination against the Spanish fleet.
Are these not our waters in that sense?
There is no equity in that.
No discrimination against the Spaniards is intended here.
.
I will start with the Hudghton report.
Thank you for pointing this out.
We will of course correct these mistakes.
There is only one Commission proposal.
Let me turn now to the Stevenson report.
The proposals relate to the western waters.
There is no going back.
Amendment No 30 concerns relative stability.
This should be looked at in more detail.
.
Perhaps this was not translated quite correctly.
It does not become invalid of its own accord.
There are therefore two conflicting legal opinions here.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
.
However, we do this for very different reasons.
Welcome
The Council plans to focus on five important entities.
Ideas and proposals have been submitted.
Considerable progress has been made.
That brings me to the western Balkans.
We shall see how this develops.
I cannot prejudge anything.
.
Without this we will lack democracy and efficiency.
We cannot accept this!
(Applause)
But I no longer have any such fears.
Nevertheless, we need to make still further progress.
(Applause)
The same should apply to home affairs.
'Yes' for Polish membership of the European Union!
That is why we need to redouble our efforts.
I wish you every success at the Thessaloniki Summit.
(Applause)
This is an absolutely fundamental point.
And that is what exacerbated the Yugoslavian tragedy.
And this involves certain fundamental issues.
Firstly, the question of the Commission.
There must be one body with executive power.
One is the economy.
What do we want to do together?
What do we really want?
Earlier, I quoted a French author.
It is clear where the danger lies for Europe.
We are unable to have proposals translated and debated.
Our democracy would be reduced to something very local.
Why?
Parliament is demeaning itself.
How do we define our identity?
First the Lisbon process.
Beware!
The Balkans is a complex region.
Which precise stance are we following?
Health, for example, is one such policy.
I believe this proposal should be given careful consideration.
We do not want that kind of Europe.
We agree with these Councils.
The Congress of Peoples is no more.
No one knows what will happen in the future.
It is unthinkable!
This is a haze, it is incomprehensible.
The current system is a thousand times better.
Provision could be made for improving the current system.
Every Presidency is characterised by certain important elements.
The President of the Commission is absolutely right.
That brings us to the Thessaloniki Summit.
Democracy means parliamentary control.
Our economies want migrants.
I hope we will look at that soon.
That would be quite wrong and extremely foolish.
Your starting point is, I think, correct.
This conclusion is in itself nothing new.
Think of European Union action in Macedonia.
Other elements must be added to them however.
It will place great demands on their citizens.
(Applause)
Nevertheless, there are far-reaching problems.
There can be no avoiding that.
And there must be cooperation with The Hague.
What does that mean?
I fear we have missed an opportunity.
We have made progress, but in which direction?
Europe must become important for its citizens.
Europe is about content and not about window dressing.
The European citizen deserves better, Mr President.
Europe is currently experiencing a few problems.
That should not happen without Parliament being consulted.
These are two essential, but different, objectives.
Do that, please.
A danger to the European Union?
To whom?
That would scarcely contribute to a more effective EU.
One EU priority this term has been food safety.
There is greater understanding and effort on numerous sides.
Efforts must be made.
We are an area with 25 Member States.
.
There is a very simple reason for this.
(Loud applause)
Thank you, Mr President of the Commission.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
(Mixed reactions)
Calm down!
It is very amusing.
That is why.
It is simple.
(Mixed reactions and applause)
He has spoken in favour.
(Applause)
I do not want to reopen the debate.
.
...
I have pleasure ...
(Laughter and applause)
So there!
(Laughter and applause)
Its support for the Parliament's position is welcome.
That is not the case at all.
We all want the reform.
We are quite open to that suggestion.
There is a great deal at stake here today.
(Applause)
That is what I should like to propose.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This compromise document is accompanied by two statements.
Before the vote:
.
I can now therefore withdraw the amendment.
I would therefore urge Members to do just that.
.
(Laughter)
Thank you for that, rapporteur!
The semicolon, and order, have been restored!
That is what support for Amendment 20 would mean.
(Applause)
It seeks to insert text.
We have precedents for this.
I am not making an arbitrary choice.
The wisdom of the House will decide the matter.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
.
We do not harbour any such delusions.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
The system should be changed.
This issue is going to go on and on.
.
.
.
Members of the EP are elected in national constituencies.
This is a vision that we do not share.
This would be quite incomprehensible.
Hence our vote against the report.
.
.
.
.
Here is mine:
.
I have therefore voted against the report once again.
No, this statute is not perfect.
Yes, this text is only a compromise.
.
.
.
Distribution takes place along lines under the public highway.
.
This argument is irrational and lacks objectivity.
To reject it accords GMO a privileged status.
These proposals consequently warrant our support.
We voted squarely in favour of the Piecyk report.
Today's text is sounder.
Its scope should nevertheless be broadened.
.
.
.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
About time!
What is going to be left for Irish fishermen?
What we have done here today is regrettable.
.
.
Last December this restrictive measure lapsed.
None of this is consistent.
That must be our first priority.
It is unjust, discriminatory and I believe illegal.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
That is the message of my report.
Turkey is no exception.
There is little room for the trade union movement.
Other candidates had leeway to make up here too.
Clarity has been the express concern of this report.
Turkey has to know where it stands now.
This is a question of mentality and culture.
Freedom of religion must not be a dead letter.
That unfortunately proved not to be the case.
You can go back as far as 1963.
They relate to Cyprus and Greek-Turkish relations.
Discussions are continuing between senior officials.
.
Turkey has a key role to play here.
There are still many examples of repressive behaviour.
That featured in our debate in the last plenary.
(Applause)
It rather implies that Turkey is not very welcome.
This can sometimes be comforting in this House.
This includes the question of minorities too.
My final remarks concern the issue of Cyprus.
And yet these friendly contacts have resulted.
I do not know how long this will last.
(Applause)
The many amendments have clearly improved the report.
There nevertheless remains one anomaly that cannot be overlooked.
Ultimately, the problems are many and varied.
Its premises were searched only recently.
Why not?
Moreover, the reference to religion is utterly superfluous.
The EU is a political and economic union.
The main thing is that they are fulfilled.
It was in fact done in committee.
Just three brief remarks about the text.
Do we want the reformers to succeed?
Torture is a matter of daily practice.
There are no rights for Christian religions in Turkey.
In Turkey, this is not guaranteed.
That is its obligation.
This will be reviewed at the end of 2004.
Please be honest, however, ladies and gentlemen!
Many of you simply do not want Turkey.
Anything else really is just a performance.
Turkey is a worthy European cooperation partner.
I am pleased at the comments from the Commissioner.
Our countries have experienced all of that.
Turkey must, of course, make significant progress.
Paper is patient!
The European Union is a Union of shared values.
This is the bottom line.
Turkey is applying to join.
We are not opposed to this in principle.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
No more cooperation frameworks are needed.
.
Multilateralism without the US may well fail.
This is an important debate.
A partnership is different from rivalry.
Firstly, as regards politics.
Secondly, in economics.
Commissioner Patten is right.
This situation changed following the fall of Communism.
Having formulated the question the answer becomes obvious.
Let us take a very simple example.
We now have the euro.
Therefore, our strategic and economic interests differ.
The United States is doing just this today.
The US needs investment to pay off its debts.
The real stakes are these.
We need to ensure that we define our interests.
Do the Council and the Commission share this vision?
This would promote the transatlantic partnership.
First, there is the question of Iraq.
This is just increasing the threat.
The European Union is at a crossroads.
We must listen to the people of Europe.
They do not want Europe to be overcautious.
Otherwise, I cannot see us achieving anything.
We cannot allow the past to overshadow the future.
The legislative dialogue must be restarted.
That is the important point.
It stands to reason.
It was extremely unilateralist from the outset.
Decisions would be taken in Washington.
Our American friends will have to accept this.
They certainly do not speak for Europe.
It adds no additional military capabilities.
This is not unilateralism.
This is sadly lacking at the moment.
The debate is closed.
.
I would like to say one other thing.
I would like to mention a few conclusions.
We did not mince our words.
It was, and still is, their task.
The Council should have taken a more professional stance.
It should speak with one voice.
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
I believe I have obeyed them to the letter.
That is why I put the question.
Subject: Trafficking in human beings
She asked about a coordinated policy of assisted returns.
The Council has competence here.
This is a new policy area for the Union.
You have 15 seconds to say your final word.
Subject: Network for epidemiological surveillance
Decision 2119/98/EC
appropriate protection of hospital personnel treating the patients;
Finally, the Council encourages the Commission to
continue coordinating EU action on SARS;
coordinate and network laboratory expertise;
Thank you, Mr President.
Subject: EU/Ukraine
Trade and business need a framework, however.
I gladly reserve the right to reply in writing.
Please submit your question to the Commission.
Subject: Problem of funding GALILEO
I cannot reply to all these details straight away.
These are Commission issues.
Subject: List of terrorist organisations
This is a particularly interesting case, incidentally.
We therefore need to ask the question again.
Subject: Violation of human rights in Cuba
These conditions are clearly a violation of human rights.
The Council will keep the situation under close review.'
A very sincere thank you for that.
I have nothing further to add.
I thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
Who sent it?
Perhaps it would have awarded them a prize?
(interruption off the microphone by Mr Korakas)
I have asked burning questions.
Subject: Thessaloniki June Council meeting
enlargement issues;
the question of EU policy in the Western Balkans;
Wider Europe, New Neighbourhood;
Thank you for taking on the seventh question.
It has been a tough session.
The question was put on a personal basis.
The Commission has not yet done this.
Are there plans to undertake such a study?
The relevant work is continuing.
Efforts have been made to bring forward this idea.
Subject: The Iranian regime's nuclear weapons programme
This is what I would like to know.
Thank you very much.
Mr Casaca has the floor for a supplementary question.
Subject: Destabilisation of the Middle East promoted by Iran
Subject: The Iranian regime's anthrax programme
Subject: Democracy and human rights in Iran
This is an explicit request.
There must be firm points of reference.
You are against a referendum?
Thank you very much, Mr Yiannitsis.
President.
The next item is the joint debate on:
However, it remains a drop in the ocean.
Parliamentary powers and possibilities for control remain restricted.
Nobody can stop this method from going ahead.
I will illustrate this with migration policy.
I can only say that this is regrettable.
Mastery of IT is nowadays required in most professions.
This cannot continue.
There are two essential categories of issues.
This strikes us as rather suspect.
The open method of coordination was a godsend.
A number of speakers have echoed this.
These have to do with democratic legitimacy.
Parliament will need to be consulted systematically.
I think that this does not benefit public involvement.
Citizens feel represented by their Members of Parliament.
I think in precisely the opposite terms.
That is something I find odd.
It would then be nothing like so effective.
I am now tabling it again.
It cannot be based upon sanctions and penalties.
What we need are best practices.
That is where the focus must be.
This method is quite different.
I should like to see this method promoted.
It is also more prevalent in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
There are interesting imbalances within it.
I believe it to be important for two reasons.
This was an extremely important achievement at the time.
Nobody produced honest figures with regard to employment.
Those figures are important.
There are risks.
Member States will then start pooling this power.
Then what?
This is very understandable.
It is really very welcome!
How are we to have access to documents?
What rules should we put in place?
So far, so good.
We can always learn from others.
Thank you, Mrs Stauner.
Let us embark on the path towards this goal.
That was absolutely spot on.
But that is a very small point.
I agree with that.
Why, though?
Is this a theme for the European Union?
It certainly is!
It has a psychological effect.
It has an effect on the company.
That is how it has been presented.
Yet what age are we living in?
That now applies to the Commission as well.
What is the reality in Europe?
That is the problem.
That is actually what we want.
Employee participation must not be just a theory.
Thank you, Mr Ettl.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
It is essential to recognise this disparity.
I wanted to stress this point.
This is also a key element.
This is the way forward.
Women remain under-represented in sports administration and decision-making.
Sport is of fundamental importance to our society.
Sport in schools involves more than just learning sports.
Sport is therefore about achieving emancipation and autonomy.
Services such as childcare are not always available.
Specific physical training should also be provided for women.
Sport must be promoted.
I hope that it extends beyond this year.
Real action on equality is needed to solve it.
That is sport.
Ladies and gentlemen, times have changed a lot.
One hundred years is not so long ago.
The first is the media.
This is not just a Spanish problem.
The second front consists of sporting bodies.
I recall the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996.
They were prevented from doing so at that time.
We cannot make such sweeping generalisations.
Quite a lot has happened.
However, this will be regulated by the market.
Women are certainly not under-represented in the media now.
Sport is undoubtedly a key area in this respect.
We must be pro-active and take the initiative here.
How are resources allocated between male and female competitions?
This has already been happening for a long time.
Sport and the arts are always dropped first.
This is completely inappropriate in serious sports reporting.
This is something we need to protest about.
The men wondered what was to happen now.
Perhaps she was better than some of them.
Women are discriminated against in sport.
Sport is significant in many ways.
Sponsors can exercise pressure on clubs.
Thank you, Mr Karlsson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
.
Breast cancer
Breast cancer affects all of us.
We know that the Commission is on our side.
A number of figures were quoted.
What does it contain?
There are great differences in Europe.
The same goes for prostate cancer.
Same problem.
Prompt detection therefore, but prompt treatment also.
I think that that is very important.
This view I share entirely.
That is by no means a luxury.
We really must learn from that.
Why is this so?
That must make us think.
There are discussions about this.
Lithuania and Latvia also have low rates.
Now it is a question of transposing them quickly.
This is particularly important with regard to breast cancer.
We do of course clash with other interest groups.
Every seventh or eighth woman will be affected.
We must therefore act at different levels:
firstly, prevention and screening.
secondly: diagnosis.
thirdly: treatment and follow-up.
Research and gene therapy will also help us.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
First, it is based on scientific data.
Let me also thank Mr Schnellhardt.
That is a clear and good principle.
I therefore ask you to consider Amendment No 127.
Which means that we keep having complaints and incidents.
Our way of working is not very transparent.
Scandals crop up again and again.
I shall appeal once more for complete transparency.
Let us not therefore be deflected in our course.
If something is wrong, they report it.
This has to do with making consumers more discerning.
The approval of establishments is another difficult question.
Who should be responsible for it?
Should it be at Community level or national level?
Where does subsidiarity fit in?
European consumers will benefit directly from this.
I salute Mr Schnellhardt for his report and diligence.
I agree with almost everything he says.
The consumer demands it, public safety requires it.
We need food safety.
Professional controls are of crucial importance here.
I am frequently in the same boat as them.
Thank you, Mr President.
We cannot treat large slaughterhouses like artisanal small businesses.
Now to the question of marine biotoxins in shellfish.
The Commission text is based on scientific proof.
This applies to the serious risks affecting food safety.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Thank you, Mrs Malliori.
Mr Posselt spoke against the proposal by Mrs Malliori.
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
(Applause)
In my opinion you have misread the Rules.
Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca rightly applied Rule 145.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
After the vote:
(The President cut off the speaker)
We have yet to see this document.
I can explain this very quickly.
There is no new Commission proposal.
The secretariat tells me that you are correct.
Before the vote on the legislative resolution:
That seems perfectly reasonable.
Mr President, it is exactly the same point.
Our amendments say they are compatible.
Can I ask you to follow the same procedure?
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
Mr President, it is not an oral amendment!
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
I certainly do not wish to be difficult.
Now though, a new procedure is creeping in.
The House then voted in accordance with Rule 145.
We cannot enforce a speaking time on them.
This was a question of convenience.
He was applying the Rules.
We need to finally get through to these people!
.
.
.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
.
.
There are serious defects in the Commission's proposal.
.
- (FR) Will Parliament be heard?
.
.
.
What do we have now?
.
.
The CAP must be reformed.
.
.
Rural development cannot exist without farmers and agricultural production.
.
.
.
This situation will be exacerbated after enlargement.
.
This proposal for a regulation is unacceptable.
We have therefore sided with the rapporteur.
.
.
.
.
.
It is costly and at times unfair.
.
.
.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
However, Turkey needs to comply with specific conditions.
.
.
.
.
(FR) I abstained.
.
.
Arrests, torture and murder continue.
DEHAP is about to be banned.
Its militia continue to occupy 37% of Cyprus.
.
Turkey is heir to a great civilisation.
.
.
.
Unfortunately, at this point the interpretations diverge.
There is a complete lack of understanding.
.
I actually think this is unfair.
I would nevertheless like all this to be investigated.
.
Sport in schools is clearly in decline.
The ELDR Group has therefore voted against this report.
.
.
.
.
Hence our vote in favour of the report.
.
.
There is a lot of work to be done.
We are dealing here with explanations of vote.
We now have written explanations of vote.
We now come to Explanation 5/2003.
We have noted the point you have made.
The clarification is simple.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
The Minutes have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
I have already asked for this to be rectified.
Thank you.
.
This communication serves two purposes.
There have frequently been many criticisms in this respect.
The agreement must be maintained up to the end.
The citizen must therefore be given an answer.
The Commission must inform the complainant immediately and consistently.
That has already been mentioned too.
Once again it boils down to transparency.
The debate is closed.
Aceh was a great seafaring nation.
This is encouraging dangerous radicalisation.
This terrifying prospect should encourage Jakarta to act tactfully.
Aceh never wanted to belong.
Military solutions have never lasted in Aceh.
President Megawati understandably wishes to prevent Indonesia falling apart.
A political solution now needs to be found quickly.
Unfortunately these continue at present.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Reports of personal injuries are all the more alarming.
Opponents are being silenced.
Anyone who has had an education is distrusted.
The regime practices systematic discrimination against the Rohingya people.
It is of crucial importance.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This resolution calls for us to renew our efforts.
Prices for essential goods are soaring in Zimbabwe.
However, those sanctions are not being consistently applied.
This must be demanded as a matter of urgency!
We have experienced many disappointments.
Let us keep things in perspective.
How does Europe handle this pressure?
Is that the right method?
This will not help us at all.
We are sending an intervention force to the Congo.
We are monitoring this week's events very closely.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Before the vote)
We urge immediate acquittal instead of release.
Mr van den Bos has the floor.
That would naturally make a very odd impression.
I understand the Greens' argument, though.
We would then vote in favour of them.
That was the last item on the agenda.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 4.40 p.m.)
Turkey constitutes a test of principle for the EU.
.
That is why I have voted against the report.
.
Each mammograph must be read independently by two radiologists.
Resumption of the session
They are currently facing capital punishment.
I am happy to do that.
Hypocrisy?
Complicity?
Without doubt both!
29 of their comrades were seriously injured.
The results of the Convention are also innovative.
It should not be lightly discarded or unbundled.
A sound basis is now available to the governments.
The Convention has given its lead.
We call now on the governments to give theirs.
Firstly, Mr President, we have a Constitution.
And this democratising effect also impacts on national parliaments.
I believe the citizen has won.
You have said that this Constitution represents radical progress.
Thank you very much to everybody for your help.
That is without parallel in history.
What is new about it?
Today, these promises have been fulfilled.
In this respect, the Constitution makes significant progress.
Treaties are based on mistrust born of past experience.
Not all the dreams have come to fruition.
That is almost unprecedented in constitutional history.
(Applause)
We have more scope for action.
We have clarity between the institutions.
(Applause)
I believe that Parliament has done significant work.
There is still work to be done.
This brings me to my final point.
I fully endorse this.
The Convention still has to meet and debate.
That, however, was not the case.
Are the Treaties really going to be simplified?
Laeken called for more democracy and transparency.
I am not sure this has happened.
What do I expect from governments, then?
Mr President, constitutions belong to the people.
Why does the electorate not have the final say?
(Applause from the right)
Work has begun on the Constitution.
Mr Straw and Mr Hain are profoundly wrong.
We must take care to avoid this.
That is the way the EU process operates.
That concludes the debate.
WRITTEN STATEMENTS (RULE 120)
On the contrary, it diminishes them.
The Roadmap must be applied.
You are well aware of the intra-Palestinian negotiation.
It is the exclusive responsibility of the European Union.
The operation is not easy.
There are now 400 soldiers in the region.
.
Further progress is needed.
All Quartet partners should be able to contribute.
Both undermine the envisaged two-State solution.
Without their political will and commitment nothing will change.
The killing will go on.
We can point to some progress.
This is not a new point for us.
Firstly, our relations with Iran.
Finally, a very brief reference to Operation Artemis.
Their Roadmap is one to hell.
Egypt too has played an active role.
This will lend impetus to the peace process.
It is already long overdue.
Something basic is missing from the step-by-step plan.
The colour of the helmets is of lesser importance.
Your state, for pity's sake!
Now you are trying to impose this famous Roadmap.
A day, a week, a month?
Two Palestinian states?
We must not set them off along that road.
We must not encourage it.
At last!
And under whose control have we placed it?
Focard's heirs!
I repeat: Focard's heirs!
I wish you luck, Mr President.
I wish you luck, fellow Members.
High Representative, Commissioner, I wish you luck.
We need it.
It also includes Prime Minister Sharon.
The settlements must be removed.
Mr President, it was 4 June in Aqaba.
Remarkable things were said.
However, neither Sharon nor Bush want that.
It has the political resources to act.
The peace process is still fragile.
You mentioned the protocol.
We need to combine it with other points.
The Commissioner cannot establish it as the main priority.
The most effective methods are the political methods.
That opportunity must not be wasted.
I think that we are playing with fire.
To finish, I have two questions.
It is futile to answer this question.
This option requires serious thought.
In fact, publication kills implementation.
Mr President, I have three observations to make.
We were horrified by the events of 11 September.
My second comment relates to the Roadmap.
We must not be mistaken as regards its nature.
That needs to be recognised.
We also need Abu Mazen to be successful.
.
Thank you very much, Mr Solana.
The debate is closed.
.
I now wish to summarise its structure for you.
.
I think the point is clear.
That is the essence of our security strategy.
The same applies to the area of non-proliferation.
I believe that we have to answer these questions.
In my view, this is the wrong approach.
It should be deployed effectively and proportionately.
This is still the current CFSP's strongest asset.
What plans exist for doing so?
No, no one takes us seriously!
Are we credible?
No.
We proclaimed: peace, peace, peace.
We therefore were not credible.
We are not credible.
Let us take another example.
No.
No.
I will end with a comment on terrorism.
Simply showing the flag is far from enough.
Good accounts make good friends.
What, however, should this strategy rest on?
On certain positions in principle and an equal footing.
What does parity mean?
We are in a new era.
This personality cannot result from minor moves.
The rules on arms exports must be stepped up.
Invariably, the weapons have been obtained illegally.
I hope that they will follow this example.
At present this applies most particularly to Africa.
.
It is a key sector for the developing countries.
Four major findings emerged from that conference.
Thirdly, the importance of the Euro-Mediterranean area.
I will come back to this.
We have projects concerning it.
The first answer is development.
I am thinking of the least developed countries.
I am thinking of the ACP group of countries.
I am thinking of the small economies.
Thirdly, the Euro-Mediterranean area.
This is precisely why trade policy is so important.
That company is relocating 500 jobs to Bulgaria.
The textile industry is very important in these countries.
That is false justice.
I see that as one of the core issues.
Obviously, this situation needs to be addressed.
Opening up trade and access creates challenges.
There is a word for it: dynamism.
To the question: can we make this link?
I have a very clear and very frank answer.
Yes, we can do it at bilateral level.
We have tried, we Europeans.
We will have to come back to it later.
A lot of governments play that game.
These are the answers I wanted to give.
Yes, globalisation has its effects.
Yes, globalisation results in relocation.
That used to be true at national level.
It has become true at European level.
The debate is closed.
They are difficult for us to accept.
.
They are a factor for integration.
.
Tomorrow, we can vote in favour.
I hope that we will.
.
Why has this been a never-ending story?
That is why we welcome it.
No doubt this can easily be corrected.
Certain other officious bureaucratic provisions have been removed.
This is good news for parliamentary democracy in Europe.
I am, myself, in favour of them.
The proposal has totalitarian features.
The proposal before us contravenes the principle of equality.
In our opinion, that constitutes real discrimination.
We have no uniform right to vote.
We owe him our thanks.
I will not conceal my personal satisfaction.
I believe they should be supported by the latter.
For what is a European party?
Matters are not very satisfactory at present.
It is almost faultless.
This brings me back to my envelopes.
It does not promote democracy, it reduces it.
It is not clear why.
Perhaps you know that, Mr Karas.
Is that democracy?
Do you know them?
Bravo for your united stance on the Gulf!
Is there a single activist in these parties?
Your compromise amendment is somewhat bizarre.
I wonder who will give the money?
Thank you very much, Mr Dell'Alba.
So much, perhaps, will not surprise you.
The bill before the House tonight traduces these principles.
That would lose us our credibility.
The financing scheme leaves no doubt about it.
Certainly, Spanish nationalists have no limits.
This makes those parties particularly artificial.
.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Access to modern energy varies considerably, however.
No new financial resources are proposed.
.
I fully share these positions.
Energy has a role in education.
This is the first, but not the last.
It should be complementary to public action.
Very often these companies are European.
Financial support is therefore needed.
The Commissioner referred to this today.
That right must be recognised, guaranteed and protected.
The need for finance is evident.
That is another kettle of fish altogether.
Please remember that, ladies and gentlemen.
True, we have proposed privatisation.
We should focus instead on genuine issues of substance.
These are two quite different issues.
Money may be private or public.
What is actually needed however are funds and resources.
I want it to continue.
Mr President, I shall not prolong the debate.
I am grateful for the contributions made.
Thank you for the debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11a.m.
The second question is that of staff training.
The third question is that of urban development planning.
.
In our opinion this is not the case.
A notification should only provide certain minimum information.
The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 8 to 11.
Moreover, potassium nitrate should also be incorporated.
We should not therefore wait any longer.
Safety should assume an important place.
This also means providing the public with sound information.
Everywhere else we have responded.
We responded to Enschede and Toulouse with this Directive.
That is a reasonable remark.
Other issues have still to be addressed.
Please act on them.
Authorities were only aware up to a point.
It is therefore logical to tighten up the rules.
Hazardous factories do not belong in housing estates.
Every citizen is entitled to this information.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
All these activities can have very serious consequences.
The Commission sets out 14 objectives and 23 actions.
They must not be seen as substitutes, however.
.
It is interesting that the Swedish Commissioner is here.
This sends out a very bad signal.
This possibility was removed and I cannot understand why.
That contributes to the depletion of stocks.
There are many predators.
Fundamental opposition from Parliament will certainly not emerge tomorrow.
That would promote shared Euro-Atlantic understanding of environmental problems.
The replies made disappointing reading.
.
I have taken note of everything you have said.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Additives in animal nutrition
.
.
This case is no different.
The ban on Nifursol may end up being re-examined.
Not that doing so would necessarily justify a ban.
I suspect they will not be that charitable.
Is it in the interests of the farmer?
Is it in the interests of the environment?
This is certainly necessary.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
.
There are many international waters with open access.
The Mediterranean fishing sector is fragile.
Their experience is vital.
The rapporteur mentions such projects in the Mediterranean.
The Mediterranean is a semi-enclosed sea.
Quite right.
This is an utter tragedy and completely unsustainable.
That will cure you for sure!
That is why it is necessary to take action.
That much is indisputable.
Is this claim true or false?
It certainly constitutes a challenge.
Who is right?
Such an evaluation would also have to be on-going.
All these efforts must be taken into account.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
We shall now adjourn until voting time.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(The President declared the common position approved)
(The President declared the common position approved)
(The President declared the common position approved)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
.
The regulation will be a well-balanced compromise.
All the compromise amendments before you fulfil this objective.
The text will be aligned as you request.
This really is a good day for European democracy.
My sincere thanks to my Greek fellow MEPs.
(Applause)
So please, support this today.
I shall read out this amendment:
Mr President, we support this oral proposal.
.
.
I therefore voted in favour.
.
Fortunately, Portugal has a fairly good take-up rate.
.
Utilisation of payment appropriations was 69%.
All this had already been mentioned in previous reports.
.
.
These are measures that will help to enhance transparency.
.
(PT) I find myself forced to abstain.
.
We must not frighten people.
.
.
We therefore voted against the motion.
.
This opens the floodgates to arbitrariness.
.
We strongly recommend that the proposal be withdrawn.
.
.
I therefore voted against the report.
There would be a significant temptation to do this.
I do not add my voice to this majority.
.
Why?
.
.
For everybody.
.
The rules and directives are in place.
.
.
I shared its positions and voted in favour.
.
.
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
.
For these reasons, I voted against the resolution.
This hostility is illustrated in Sections 8 and 14.
.
Lastly we cannot support QMV in the CFSP.
Resumption of the session
Openness.
Piet Dankert, monsieur le PrÃ©sident.
Perseverance.
Democracy.
Vision.
Governments were not quite ready for this.
Enjoyment.
Relations.
The following changes have been proposed
I will be quicker next time!
They wanted to work in Europe.
These reports have been ongoing over the past week.
That is a long time.
We have a cooperation agreement with that country.
We have written to the authorities concerned.
Such was the prevailing opinion.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
There are other similar or even more unpleasant remarks.
But that is a separate issue.
Let the Council simply adopt our statute.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
rapporteur.
This solution may be pure in legal terms.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
This should put some fears to rest.
.
That is something the Commission objects to.
It is an important and highly significant achievement.
What is today's debate about?
What do we mean by a prospectus?
What does the directive aim at?
The directive has rather missed the mark here.
That is what we need.
This may well continue to be a live issue.
We fundamentally support the idea of issuer choice.
We therefore risk weakening the markets.
I accept the distinction established between debt and capital.
We can thus tolerate a lesser degree of rigour.
These two questions remain pressing.
I also fought hard against this.
I believe that is a great success.
That is a victory for Parliament.
On this point, the compromise is satisfactory.
I believe this is a very good thing.
Finally, there was the matter of convertible bonds.
Should convertible bonds be treated as equity securities?
We are fully reassured on this important point.
Mr Turchi's amendments will remain on the table.
This will become a selling point.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Wednesday.
and
.
.
That concern was also explicitly debated with Council.
That is why the Commission cannot accept those amendments.
Amendment No 24 must therefore be rejected.
With this I believe we can all agree.
That was a real advance.
Then we have the common position.
That would give rise to all manner of disputes.
Let us be brave!
Let us go forward, colleagues!
Why are they not included?
We must move forward in other areas as well.
This is not an instrument for adding new provisions.
I agree with you on that.
This must become a natural part of public procurement.
These lists are arbitrary.
Water is a public good.
Experience in the UK and elsewhere is frightening.
That is a frightening prospect.
I want, briefly, to consider four points.
State money attracts them.
Returns are all that counts.
Social organisation has been reduced to a balance sheet.
No!
Who would not be?
You forget other aims, however.
That seems incredible to me.
Very well, then.
Not to do so would be a retrograde step.
We want to create innovation.
This is only the lower level.
That is the only thing we need.
That is why we are pushing this so much.
My Europe is a Europe of citizens.
I am proud of this.
No one is talking about disturbing the internal market.
Philips and Daf were in dire straits.
There was little employment in the building industry.
We found this valuable and subsequently applied it.
But we could have gone further.
.
Mr MacCormick referred to the current state of jurisprudence.
There is no doubt about that.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.34 p.m.)
Greek Presidency
Six months of important events and developments have intervened.
We said then that we had five main priorities.
A second point was the new employment strategy.
We overcame that.
What was the problem?
What does the agreement mean to farmers?
And it acquired it during this period.
.
We must learn from this for the future.
Europeans must act together!
The second point concerns the Convention.
A further point is the Convention.
Mr President, I have a problem.
Finally, a comment on external relations.
Please do not cease your efforts.
The Liberal Democrats in this House agree with you.
What, then, does this document say?
Let me give you a few quotations.
The new threats are dynamic.
Left alone, they will become more dangerous'.
That is the question, Mr Prodi!
The Chalkidiki Summit was also a success.
This was not a foregone conclusion.
We were put under pressure by governments.
So far this request has been turned down.
They too are making efforts to enter the EU.
Hold referendums on the constitution in all the countries.
I doubt it.
I wish the Convention had chosen this route.
No democrat should put up with that.
The result would certainly be greatly inferior.
The European Council was completely silent upon this point.
Each of us shall serve his cause.
The Council is denied any power of legislating.
I hope that will not be the case.
To my mind, the opposite is the case.
Should we have more qualified-majority votes?
What will we use them for?
Yet very important issues of principle are still outstanding.
Yet a nation is not simply past history.
Why this standstill on such an acute problem?
What readmission agreements were concluded?
With duality?
Double structures?
And what Community of values?
And, finally, what values?
That is very good.
I do not understand.
Will Greece do so?
We will need this imagination.
We have a lot at stake in this field.
The co-existence of our Member States is at stake.
You have made some reform progress but not enough.
I agree with him.
This feeling is not present among Union citizens.
This calls for staying power and caution.
The Convention has not quite finished its work.
It is important that progress be made on that.
Greece is a case in point.
You have helped to make this happen.
This may give rise to conflicts within the EU.
This weakness should therefore be remedied.
When and how shall we be discussing these issues?
Therefore the situation is not the same.
The third point concerns Parliament's involvement.
You cannot rely on structures alone.
Europe is more than the sum of its parts.
Europe is more than the sum of the governments.
All of us are Europe!
You mentioned it in only one sentence.
Media freedom in Serbia is under threat.
Please give your word.
Do not tolerate it!
Otherwise, thank you very much for your commitment.
I thought I knew Europe well.
Therefore, compromises are needed on all issues.
There is misinformation here.
Of course it was discussed.
That is not what it is about.
This is the distribution of burdens.
We need prevention.
That would be ridiculous.
Why, what did we want to do?
I should like to close by repeating our aspiration.
We need to create.
We cannot stay put.
.
The first point concerns immigration.
Firstly, close, ongoing cooperation with third countries.
Secondly, solidarity between Member States.
There can be no tolerance of modern-day slave traders.
Lastly, we must not confuse rigour with inhumanity.
My second point is equally brief.
This is progress.
(Loud applause)
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
(Applause)
The plane was half an hour late.
(Laughter and applause)
(The President cut off the speaker)
.
(Loud applause)
None of us should be coming here.
It is not anti-French: it is anti-Air France.
(Loud applause)
They are not contradictory.
Transport problems provide an easy excuse.
One Member saw rats everywhere, and so on ...
This will facilitate communication between the various operators.
.
That concludes voting time.
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Would you please correct my mistake?
(The Minutes were approved)
We have had only limited success here.
I was and still am strongly opposed to this.
There was no majority in favour of this.
.
.
.
The USA has already filed a complaint.
We are not making policy to order here.
I confess to having no such absolute certainties.
We think there are good reasons for scepticism.
That is an illusion.
Anything else would amount to deceiving the consumer.
Otherwise, these two regulations would quickly become wastepaper.
This is not about unavoidable technical uncertainty.
The Council is proposing 0.9%.
This is too much!
Secondly, GMOs pose two major risks.
What should we do?
Certainly we should continue with the research.
It also means communication without ideology.
These texts propose lifting the moratorium.
That is a disgrace for Europe!
The political system has abandoned all responsibility.
I can give you a list.
There is John Ashcroft, the US Attorney General.
What does this mean?
Meanwhile, what are we doing?
Our legalism is up against their imperialism.
That is a tiny amount.
Let us be honest.
I have one question for the Commission.
There already is.
We did not do so.
What should the legal framework contain?
A non-GMO label would therefore have been much better.
He must be released.
I do, however, have several reservations.
The first concerns the 0.9% threshold.
My second reservation concerns consumer choice.
Demand for GM food is not driven by consumers.
They should also stop exploiting them.
What are we going to do in Europe?
It is absolutely impossible!
This is all about profit and greed.
We have to be very careful here.
This is the real challenge we face.
How kind!
The consumer will never discover what he has eaten.
No doubt it was too late for that.
It is no panacea.
We must minimise the risk.
The moratorium therefore must stay in place.
It is vital that those processes are taken seriously.
.
Perhaps that is the case.
The choice is for them.
I also enjoyed working with her during that period.
.
This is not the situation.
This is a fact.
We have proposed traceability labelling.
We have looked at food and feed proposals.
We have added this.
This is exactly what it addresses.
This is exactly what we have taken into consideration.
Is it enough to restart authorisations?
That is the main point for me.
This is how we do it.
That is utter nonsense.
My fear is that this House is being tricked.
Is it not technically avoidable?
I ask you to speak and account for this.
I had reasons for saying what I said earlier.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
People are afraid of anything that is new.
I support the compromise.
.
Millions of Europeans use medicines everyday.
This has not happened by chance.
G10 medicines were born out of this background.
Benefits to patients are at the heart of G10.
.
There are a number of interlinked issues here.
This is the critical issue at stake here.
Relative effectiveness is one key tool towards rational use.
This brings me to the issue of benchmarking.
Finally, the discussion on enlargement is particularly timely.
The accession treaties have been signed.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
I have just one question for the Commissioners.
.
Thank you, Mrs Bordes.
.
The Commission has never proposed direct-to-consumer advertising.
I believe that this is a crucial point.
.
There is a lack of innovation.
Your communication is therefore very well-timed.
.
.
.
.
There are also other issues in this field.
I would be interested in your views on that.
.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I.
.
Thank you for your response, Commissioner.
.
.
I wish to thank Commissioner Nielson for his reply.
.
Economic relations with both countries
This all bodes well.
One negotiating round was concluded last week in AsunciÃ³n.
We can only welcome these statements.
Subject: Foreign trade with southern Africa
How can we improve the situation?
There is virtually nothing moving on that front.
Your question is most pertinent.
The answer to Mr Purvis's question is no.
There are peoples fleeing from war.
There are shattered countries.
There are tragedies in Africa that defy description.
You are quite right.
I repeat; you are quite right.
This is a daily chore that requires patience.
This, I believe, would be a mistake.
Subject: WTO - TRIPS
Our strategy remains the same.
The diagnosis is, therefore, clear.
Subject: Unfair competition from goods imported from China
The details are missing.
We must make clearly separate two issues.
This can quite easily be checked and investigated.
Give us more precise details, then.
We must respect that commitment.
I would ask the other Commissioners' forgiveness.
I had to attend another Parliamentary meeting.
.
Is that mutual solidarity not in this way undermined?
.
.
Commissioner, thank you very much for your answer.
.
I cannot say more than this.
Subject: Principle of 'fair compensation'
Directive 2001/29/EC
.
.
What are the facts of the case?
.
Let us see how all this works in practice.
Subject: Rapid Alert Notifications
.
We will do so for each subsequent year.
Does the Commissioner have this information on him now?
.
That is their responsibility under the rapid alert system.
Since my enquiry in April (H-0149/03
.
Has he ever seen an auction market?
.
I raised that question specifically with them.
.
Is this non-compliance not reprehensible?
Your reply can only be yes.
.
Shortcomings are still being detected.
.
Allergies have hitherto been unheard-of in this area.
This new directive gives consumers certainty.
Thank you very much, Mrs KlaÃ.
I will then ask you to conclude very speedily.
I shall address this issue in three ways.
.
I will address each dossier in turn.
However, one question is not completely settled.
It is, therefore, not acceptable.
I very much welcome the progress made.
Parliament supported this.
They help in technical processes such as filtering.
I thank you.
My group will support all three of these reports.
That has fortunately been retained in the compromise.
All of this alters their characteristics fundamentally.
May I just make one additional observation?
Would the Commission like to say anything more?
One final response, perhaps, Commissioner?
.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The shadow rapporteurs have been especially helpful.
Which is why recycling and prevention are necessary.
I shall turn to them briefly now.
First of all recycling.
This is an important part of the directive.
That is why we need clear objectives now.
We need a good middle position.
This compromise is 55% in 2007.
They must themselves be involved with this.
Waste and recycling have become global markets.
The exporter must prove this.
Prevention.
We have to do something about producer responsibility.
The responsibility of producers here is not just financial.
Firstly, re-use.
Deposit systems can indeed conflict with the internal market.
I have a question for the Commission about this.
Commissioner, what is your opinion on this?
.
This revision builds on this success.
This also applies to the accession states.
Therefore they merit a proper discussion.
This is neither fair, logical nor equitable.
So let us be flexible.
The issue of recovery is a major problem.
Recovery is stretching definitions to the extreme.
How right that is!
Others will find them impossible to meet.
The United Kingdom has a problem with this.
For many years we have relied on landfill.
Our geology favoured that.
That takes time and money, Mrs Corbey.
That would kill off small businesses.
That is not what all this is about!
Such a thing would surely be false.
I would ask you to support that.
Culture change takes time.
A realistic timetable for implementation is five years.
I can understand the compromises that have been made.
Not everyone can be equally tough.
What we have therefore is a trade embargo.
We import 75% of our packaged goods.
There will be another time for that.
They pose no problems for the environment.
I therefore urge you to support Amendment No 4.
.
We will therefore have to come back to this.
Thank you very much, Commissioner
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
We will vote on this recommendation tomorrow.
.
It has the support of all Member States.
I think we are on the right track.
Many thanks, Mr Moreira da Silva.
Climate change has major economic and social consequences.
We cannot skate over it too lightly.
The PSE Group is entirely satisfied on other points.
That too is an important point for us.
The allocation of emission rights is already complicated enough.
It is also a reflection of our shared concerns.
Emissions trading is not a market mechanism.
We must not let that happen to European industry.
There are many questions the directive does not answer.
I will mention some of them.
How will its sale or non-sale be taxed?
How will emissions be recorded in company balance sheets?
And that is most sorely needed.
This was an extremely controversial proposal.
How will this impact on our business?
That was the underlying intention of this proposal.
Yet something good came out of it.
The political compromise takes the existing differences into account.
I will mention just three of them.
May it continue to do so.
For example, are emissions rights securities?
How are they treated?
Europe is now moving into unfamiliar territory.
That of course is our real problem.
.
Firstly, the treatment of allowances.
This is now part of this compromise package.
We will also come back on these issues.
Could you please answer this question?
.
Thank you very much for that additional information.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
It is currently legal to fill chickens with water.
What is your response to this?
.
Third, the meat contents expressed have been overstated.
Fraud appears when you are looking for fraud.
I would like to press the Commissioner further.
That is long enough.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
.
First of all we have agriculture.
What are the financial consequences of this rate?
We want to make a start on this.
Something has to be done about that.
Common foreign and security policy.
We shall be examining it closely.
It is always interesting to make this comparison.
We shall be raising this as well.
.
EUR 55 million are now available for fisheries research.
.
.
.
Who can help?
Mr Mulder is willing, who else?
The Commission or the Council perhaps?
The situation is alarming.
That is hard to understand.
Please give us your support.
Now to the individual points.
I want to concentrate on a number of questions.
This is an excellent reform.
Given enlargement this cannot occur.
Amendment No 4 does not therefore warrant any support.
.
That is not the case.
This money is for the entire European Union.
I just wanted to make that correction.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
There are a whole lot of different problems.
We must therefore make a new attempt this year.
That is not something we intend to accept.
.
These are direct figures from the accounts.
You will be getting a detailed listing of these.
It is a fundamental reform.
We had a special situation with humanitarian aid.
You mentioned it yourself.
I think everyone involved agrees with that.
The situation is grave.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
First, on the subject of child soldiers.
Children are a focus for humanitarian aid in ECHO.
Secondly, on combating trafficking in children.
Thank you very much for your attention.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12.38 a.m.)
The programme of the Italian Presidency
, President-in-Office of the Council.
A great Europe needs great institutions.
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
No reform is possible on the basis of unanimity.
The Commission is working actively on this.
That is why the Commission has decided to react.
This calls for vision and conviction.
(Applause from the right)
Sometimes people have no sense of symbolism.
What a great moment in history!
(Applause from the right)
Mr President-in-Office, you talked about strong European institutions.
(Laughter and heckling)
Mr President-in-Office, you mentioned infrastructure projects.
We will be looking at that very carefully.
We do not want that to happen.
(Applause from the right)
Today you have taken the Ciampi line.
(Applause from the left)
That is the cornerstone of European construction.
(Applause from the left)
Now there is something else, however.
The Convention has taken place.
The doors cannot be closed.
You have also talked about the European economy.
(Applause from the left)
She has had no problem talking to everybody.
Why should an important European have such a problem?
(Applause)
I hope this is not a presage.
So initiatives to revive growth are welcome.
These two policy areas are linked.
This is the trademark of the most conservative forces.
(Applause from the left)
In all this, it is disregarding Community law.
Then you are on excellent terms with President Putin.
One final word on the European Constitution.
(Applause from the left)
(Applause from the right)
Is the Danish constitution lawful or unlawful?
What does it say?
This is quite clear.
And that is supposed to herald its accession!
This is Christian Europe!
We Radicals applauded!
We applauded at the G8!
Those few have now become the vast majority.
That is not all.
This, Mr President-in-Office, is not Europe.
It will never work without legal immigration options.
Peace in the regions in Europe is also important.
I believe this question at least deserves your attention.
Let us take foreign policy, for instance.
You are absolutely right on all three counts!
(Applause)
You are a friend of Sharon against Arafat.
You did not expressly defend the draft constitution.
Do not disappoint it.
But what does it really mean in practice?
There cannot be competition between us and America.
We ought to talk about him as well!
Why should that be?
Is Italy not a member of the European Union?
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Heckling)
I have had nothing.
I waited with bated breath.
But what we got was the usual warm words.
That is what concerns me.
I am also concerned by a lack of consistency.
That will not happen in this House.
That is something you must now clearly reject.
In international affairs, transatlantic relations are obviously fundamental.
European solidarity depends on such efforts.
Christianity is no restriction to the secularity of politics.
I wish you success in your work!
It talks in riddles.
Italy is a great European country.
You, Italy, are a clear example.
You ask us not to bring Italian arguments here.
Do not bring the Italian debate on immigration here.
We do not need it.
We do not need an escalation of press headlines.
We need to know exactly what is going on.
I wish the President success.
Thank you very much!
Parliament fully agrees with the Commission's recommendations.
A last thought concerns world poverty.
(Applause from the right)
What has happened in the world since 11 September?
(Applause from the right)
I will suggest you for the role of guard.
You would be perfect!
(Laughter, protests from the left)
(Applause from the right)
Why?
(Uproar on the left)
You have made a proposal.
(Applause)
There is considerable emotion in the House regarding this.
(Mixed reactions)
We will close the debate after hearing Mr Prodi.
I do not need three minutes.
I will be very brief.
(Standing ovation)
I said what I said ironically.
I said it ironically; he did that maliciously!
Colleagues!
Please, could we have some calm!
We are running very late.
I will not take those points.
It is unfortunate.
It is regrettable.
(Sustained applause)
In what fields?
These are the guidelines for the coming six months.
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
Others have long since left the building.
In short, it wants to liberalise.
That is why we voted against it.
The Helsinki case was about this very issue.
For these reasons, we voted against this proposal.
.
I reject this approach.
.
The same applies to concerns regarding discrimination.
This too must be counteracted.
This directive follows the Lisbon Strategy guidelines closely.
.
We need this labelling.
.
.
.
(FR) No compromise is entirely satisfactory.
Measures supporting and encouraging such research should never cease.
.
The Cartagena Protocol on biodiversity recognises this right.
.
.
This last point is essential.
.
.
The rules should be clear and simple.
.
.
.
I respect their work.
Detectability should then also replace the paper criterion.
.
This is done in difficult circumstances.
They need to resist attempts to bribe them.
.
Personally, I cannot agree.
I broadly shared the rapporteur's stance.
We regard it as a good instrument.
We feel that this is not the right approach.
.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
.
.
There must be no doubt about this.
That is what happened the first time.
Human rights must be protected.
This will require a long-term presence.
Outsiders cannot advise or guide them.
But that is by no means enough.
The situation is far more complex.
People are being abducted on a daily basis.
What sort of political process is this?
So this is the normalisation process!
That is what it is really about.
Convenient partners for bogus peace talks have been created.
The OSCE has already observed elections in Chechnya.
There has already been peace in Chechnya once.
Why has he been forced to go underground?
That is not the sort of normalisation we want!
The referendum was an illusion of normality.
Chechnya is an international issue.
We need effective election monitoring.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
There is still therefore much to be done.
Firstly, agriculture.
In agriculture, we have done our duty.
The second point is market access for industrial products.
This is a major objective of the Doha programme.
This objective remains one of the Union's priorities.
These questions cannot be separated from the single commitment.
I am personally delighted about that.
We will do so with you.
Firstly, on agriculture.
My group has a number of outstanding questions.
The second set of questions concerns the Singapore issues.
Final set of questions.
The Development Agenda must not be a paper tiger.
What is meant by sufficient manufacturing capacity?
Let us not forget the spirit of Doha.
Nature and human beings are not commodities.
Work for sustainable and fair solutions in Cancun.
Let me ask you a few questions.
Mr Clegg has already spoken about this.
What has sugar got to do with rural development?
Of course we appreciate the importance of both.
What should the EU do in those circumstances?
Let us concentrate on them at Cancun.
But it is a bit like squaring the circle.
The negotiations on GATS need to change course.
The distinctive nature of European farmers must be protected.
Now, the Doha deadlines are to be maintained.
My question is therefore this.
These include the service sector among many others.
Now for my third point.
So far, no progress has been made.
Under these circumstances, there should be a moratorium.
It is, after all, a development round.
Cancun is in the new world.
Let us look at the Singapore subjects.
You are right.
What path should we take?
We must find ways of responding to this concern.
We are working on this.
I will deal with two or three more questions.
We do not export any cotton.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
Our initiative will take various forms.
The Union regrets this measure.
What does this position mean?
So how can we put forward our position?
This position was the result of reasoning and dialogue.
What are the results?
The results are rather mixed.
No one will be surprised at this.
This is when we got this Tribunal for Yugoslavia.
Power is exerted in order to administer law.
This is a very fine definition of national interest.
There may be room for some humour in this.
It will help make the world a safer place.
That is extremely perverse.
The Balkan states are in a very vulnerable position.
Croatia and Bulgaria have refused to sign.
Everybody must be equal before the law.
This attitude can only leave us all with doubts.
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
.
These restrictions cannot be justified on any account.
I thank the Mr President-in-Office.
His reply is very positive.
Subject: Suicide attacks against European targets in Casablanca
Similar opinions have appeared in other European media.
.
.
So I would like to ask a question.
.
.
Subject: Illegal occupation of Iraq
.
Firstly, in relation to the resolution.
.
.
Subject: Human rights in Russia
.
The Russian state today is achieving economic growth.
It is making progress again.
Subject: Hallmarking of precious metals
.
.
.
I also wish to ask a follow-up question.
.
Subject: Ban on cloning
.
I would like to put just two supplementary questions.
.
.
I would thank you very much for your answer.
Subject: Human rights workers in Indonesia
.
Will the Council make contact with the Indonesian authorities?
.
Subject: Victims of the war in Iraq
How many were members of the military?
How many were women?
How many were children?
How many were reporters?
How many reporters, woman and children were injured?
What other data of this type should be compiled?
.
.
Today, however, we have an occupation.
So there were other reasons.
What will the Italian Presidency do?
Will it act to stop this criminal occupation?
.
.
.
.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
The next item is the joint debate on
.
So how do matters stand?
Why is this so?
How are these to become reality?
The problem with European airspace is congestion.
The objectives in the report are ambitious.
It has a number of far-reaching proposals.
One of them concerns the division of airspace.
A problem, too, is charges.
I will come back to this.
Harmonisation would also be ensured for pricing of services.
Is this good or bad?
I think that it is a process.
The European Parliament has espoused the first philosophy.
This was the philosophy at first reading.
The concerns and doubts prevailed.
In this procedure, the Council must demonstrate flexibility.
That is what it is about.
.
That is not our job.
We simply cannot do that, ladies and gentlemen.
We are not liberalising anything here.
There will therefore be neither liberalisation nor competition.
That is another issue.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
What do we want from the conciliation procedure?
Consequently, we must be moderate in our position.
And they must also be respected in this instance.
This is a false distinction.
Both sides of this equation have to be considered.
(Applause)
Noise, too, constitutes a nuisance.
That will not help matters at all.
That is simply false.
Let me give you a simple example.
Never could you justify such a thing!
In moral terms, Austrians have no greater entitlement.
It is just not on!
The Austrians reject anything of the sort.
We are familiar with all the technical proposals.
Do not rob these people of their homeland!
(Vigorous applause)
.
It represents an Austrian exception.
I just wanted to clarify that.
That is all.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow.
The second issue concerns the distance bands.
We then come to the subject of cancellations.
.
We are taking numerous steps in this direction.
Consequently, I totally agree with the rapporteur.
We nonetheless have two points of disagreement with him.
What might the side-effects of the regulation be?
Compensation must be paid where flights are cancelled.
That is my main objection at the moment.
That is no longer acceptable, however.
Unfortunately, we find this a very vague concept.
The problem lies with mechanical breakdown.
This is where action is urgently needed!
I hope colleagues will support Amendment No 2.
This extends the provision to other modes.
Will you, Commissioner, support Amendment No 2?
Commissioner, will you support that Amendment?
But that is a semantic aside.
One case among 250 000 others, I imagine.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
I apologise again for Mr Bradbourn's unavoidable absence.
.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow.
.
The amendments he proposes clarify or improve the text.
The Commission agrees with and accepts these suggestions.
, rapporteur.
Our responsibility extends to the models of cars.
I should like to express my thanks for this.
Even consumers have a one-sided awareness of these things.
We cannot throw out the baby with the bathwater.
I am extremely pleased with the outcome.
That is not my last word on the matter.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow.
(The sitting closed at midnight)
We have tried to seek a compromise.
.
Thank you Mr Staes.
ECB 2002 annual report
So, President, you are particularly welcome.
Many thanks, Mr President.
The last quarter saw zero growth.
This puts the European Union in a worrying situation.
Many of those expectations were not realised.
.
.
Monetary growth was strong in 2002.
Other policy-makers also have to take up their responsibilities.
We could do something to change that.
After all, there is a 1-dollar note!
(Applause)
It is a question of transparency and public scrutiny.
Transparency and public scrutiny are always good for democracy.
This needs to be tackled once and for all.
That needs to be emphasised too.
I would like to make one last point.
That is something I feel very strongly about.
They are believed to constitute real progress.
Many thanks for your work.
She is mistaken.
In fact, the reverse is true.
I think that is a mistake too.
You have already changed the inflation range.
That is pure nonsense!
.
May I add one remark?
Let me be crystal clear on that.
That is our aim.
Is the definition of price stability too rigid?
I do not believe so.
We recently clarified our definition and our strategy.
Let me answer another question clearly.
The answer is that we do not see that.
Deflation is not around the corner.
That is clear.
Is the definition too rigid?
Let me speak anecdotally.
Let me remind you and give an example.
Their answer was: 'Why?
What's so special about the euro?
We don't know anything else!
What was there to explain?'
It is simply their money.
(Applause)
We are deeply grateful to you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at 12 noon.
.
We must make more progress in this direction.
The euro area is growing.
We have finally obtained a practical common European symbol.
The euro has provided stability and security.
He asked for strong coordination of economic policies.
Nevertheless, the disadvantages exist too.
I hope it is not heading towards a superstate.
The euro denominations currently in circulation are fine.
The euro has actually been our currency since 1999.
The euro payment zone did not really exist.
The euro is not only a means of payment.
Thank you, Mr FÃ¤rm.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
(Applause)
What are the specific objectives of the report?
.
Why are there calls for gender budgeting?
I shall give two examples.
A second example is as follows.
It does not give them their due.
They will be forced to be the same.
Where have I heard those words before?
The resolution tramples on the subsidiarity principle.
That is why we need a budget analysis.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mrs GrÃ¶ner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
That is right.
We will see what we can do.
The next item is the vote.
Joint motion for a resolution
Amendment No 16 deletes Article 18(2).
Before the vote on Amendment No 31:
Amendment No 31 deletes Article 10.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Before the vote:
It is about compulsory agricultural expenditure.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
.
.
.
That is a democratic requirement.
.
I was persuaded to vote in its favour.
.
The reality is very different.
.
We need generational budgeting.
Which generations pay the taxes?
Which generations gain the most advantage from public expenditure?
Which social categories shoulder the tax burden?
Is it the rich or the poor?
This is a question about justice.
.
.
.
This particularly applies in the case of long-distance traffic.
The neoliberal ideology has since arrived.
.
Parliament's amendments are the result of all-liberal ideology.
.
We welcome FUA as a major step forward.
.
.
Food additives are already regulated.
This guarantees the precautionary principle.
For these reasons, we agree with the rapporteur.
.
.
(FR) We voted against the joint resolution.
These are atrocious as a result of Russian bombardments.
.
.
That is what I hope will happen.
.
.
.
.
This would give the WTO further powers.
This misses the point of what the WTO is.
.
This goes against the interests of the poor countries.
That is why we voted against the report.
.
.
.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Social security differs from country to country.
We have had a shortage of tools to date.
.
I shall now address these.
(The President cut off the speaker)
My group has endorsed Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report.
That is where opportunities lie, particularly for women.
There are vast areas in Europe with large cities.
This report is thus very timely.
We will need to shape those forces.
Some of these forces are more flexible than others.
This recognition is, of course, necessary.
Families there live by farm tourism.
What would become of this without the female entrepreneur?
This is all done in dribs and drabs.
(Applause from the centre and left)
Society owes them a debt of gratitude.
Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report follows that line.
We must incentivise transversal policies for helping women.
It is necessary because the CAP is still sexist.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
.
Nor are there enough controls.
The first is the issue of speed limiters.
The legislation exists.
.
I will try to respond to these three arguments.
The Commission reiterates this in its decision.
The decision says no more than that.
France and the livestock price therefore came under pressure.
In an exceptional crisis, exceptional measures are needed.
Mr President, I totally disagree with your analysis.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon.
This situation is completely unacceptable.
This was brought up before in this Parliament.
There must be total freedom there.
Cambodia has a horrifying and violent past.
The Cambodian people deserve a peaceful future.
My group has concerns on both counts.
The human rights situation is still bad.
We too have come a long way.
In January and February the situation was extremely worrying.
Violence is still taking place today.
.
The joint debate is closed.
They did not get a fair trial.
The situation in Laos is quite alarming.
Many of these people are unjustifiably in prison.
They do not have visitation rights.
This morning we met with a delegation from Laos.
The evidence that they gave us raised serious concerns.
There should be freedom of the press.
It must stop.
The court case was also criticised by Washington.
They called it a farce.
They called for a fair trial.
It was brutally wrecked by Communist occupation.
We in the European Union seek cooperation with Laos.
Their names and locations have not been published.
They are simply Laotians.
This is crucial.
We have dozens of cooperation projects running.
.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
His story was shocking.
Freedom of speech is essential for democracy.
In the year before it was less than 100.
Much needs to be done.
Responsibility for this lies in various quarters.
No!
It is, therefore, being punished.
How does the Commission assess this threat of war?
That is why we need a clear-cut policy here.
.
Providing aid is clearly not everything, however.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
That is why we want to add to it.
It is as follows:
Qa. ...
I do not believe this would be appropriate.
It talks about 'the American journalist'.
.
.
Thank you very much for you comment.
I have taken good note of it.
Parliament has come to the end of its agenda.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 5.35 p.m.)
Statement by the President
The following change has been proposed:
(Parliament agreed to the request)
The order of business was thus established.
I understand that it will have her urgent attention.
(Laughter and applause)
To my point now.
The issue to which you refer certainly deserves consideration.
The delegation included lawyers, politicians and trade unionists.
I will respond to that.
I shall look into the issues you raised.
Now we have Najaf.
It was also an advertisement for the European notion.
We crossed four national boundaries.
I would be happy to do that.
This Fund was set up in three months.
This phenomenon has also caused considerable damage.
My third point concerns civil protection.
They are right to do so.
Nobody is now left unaware of that.
We funked it.
We did not manage to do that.
They did not manage to do that.
It is true that Europe must do more.
It is crucial that we step up awareness-raising campaigns.
What are we requesting?
It is madness!
We must make huge investments in these policies.
One of the problems is the clearing of scrub.
We are world leaders in wood heating.
Agricultural policy has caused us to lose some farmers.
Europe must be innovative.
Was this the result of humanity's own thoughtlessness?
The answer must be both of those factors.
This gives us food for thought.
Are the Portuguese fire-worshippers, perhaps?
I doubt it, however.
Soil erosion does the rest, and desertification continues.
We therefore agree that funds should indeed be reallocated.
The depopulation of rural areas is a reality.
It is a national disaster.
These figures are terrifying.
Finally, I would turn to prevention and causes.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Where is this Timisoara taking place?
Under Milosevic?
In Baghdad, under Saddam Hussein?
In Haider's Austria?
In the camps under the guards mentioned by Berlusconi?
In Somalia, in the Rwanda of 1000 hills?
It is in France.
Where did all these deaths occur?
They were not given enough to drink.
They died of dehydration.
Why is that?
Why?
Most of those who died were women.
What, then, is to be done?
Then there are the immediate requirements.
Let us keep this in mind.
I began in this Parliament in 1986.
Why have appropriations always been left over, Commissioner?
Why?
Because the governments have not used them?
We must take action at Community level.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Meteorologists are unanimous: we can expect more heatwaves.
I would have thought that resources were available.
Let us, then, learn the lessons.
That is preaching to the converted.
Prevention is precisely what we are talking about here.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Furthermore, that tone managed to ease our burden.
Mr Coelho mentioned the speed of payment.
It will therefore be usable from October.
Switzerland was mentioned.
Morocco has also contributed to the relief effort.
The money is, therefore, there.
It is not the money that is lacking.
Chance has nothing to do with it.
Mrs Ries mentioned education.
That is fine by me.
That concludes the item.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
The first is the issue of the legislation.
This leads me to my second comitological point.
(Sustained applause)
.
Mr President, this is an important subject.
Parliament's interest in this issue is most welcome.
We are now very close to achieving that objective.
Venture capital is risk capital.
The fifth area demands something of us.
A transparent partnership must be created or extended.
Mr President.
The EU average is only 46%.
The consequences would be disastrous.
This is particularly important in relation to investment firms.
Mr President.
Basel II still needs to be discussed.
.
A number of Members have asked for further studies.
Mrs Randzio-Plath and others mentioned the matter of procyclicality.
Soft law means that Parliament may be circumvented.
Mr Radwan also drew attention to accounting standards.
I think Mr Radwan would agree with that.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
The title of the report is not accurate.
I would say it is slightly misleading.
The states are at liberty to follow this method.
I just want to quickly address three principles.
That is absolutely vital.
Those are three important principles in an excellent report.
.
I will be brief.
That is a very good point.
However, it is certainly worth considering.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 9.10 p.m.)
Cohesion policy
and
, Rapporteur.
Thus it:
They need to be simplified.
It is translated in different ways in different languages.
The Commissioner recently ordered studies on the subject.
We should not try to lump everything together here.
This triad is important.
Thank you, Mr Duin.
That is inevitable.
Through united efforts we can take care of both.
Our group supports the main arguments in the reports.
The same region nevertheless holds many great opportunities.
Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz's report has increased cohesion.
We understand one another better now.
The inequalities in regional development continue to exist.
We must remember that enlargement will increase regional disparities.
These regions were sidelined under previous programmes.
That is the so-called statistical effect.
We want to avoid this.
It is especially true of areas like my constituency.
I represent Aragon in Spain.
Yesterday Commissioner Barnier outlined the difficulties facing Portugal.
Or should we be aiming at a balanced Europe?
Furthermore, such ageing is inevitable.
Today is no different.
In essence, this is a good idea.
I believe this fundamental revaluation to be important.
There are handicaps that are ongoing.
The ferry connection is quite crucial in this connection.
It is a question of creating equal conditions.
The French overseas departments will not be affected.
People must be able to reside throughout Europe.
European policy must, therefore, also promote cohesion.
There must be a regional policy.
We must also have territorial cohesion.
We must be able to live in these areas.
Administration must be dramatically reformed and greatly simplified.
That is why this rule too should be revised.
We must keep on the right track.
I must emphasise one point in particular.
It concerns our development indicators.
GDP alone is no longer a relevant criterion.
It must not be a uniform policy, however.
This is an initial first victory.
I would like to comment on three areas.
Firstly, Europe is a Community of peace.
It is solidarity that we are talking about today.
Neither is solidarity limited to the nation state.
I am particularly unhappy about the timing.
Enlargement is only eight months away.
Well then, what can we do?
How?
Currently these areas have Objective 1 status.
It is also very much welcomed by the Parliament.
How could this happen?
.
Solidarity is one of these.
Nobody wants that to happen.
We are currently witnessing a very significant change.
Commissioner Barnier is well aware of it.
This is indeed significant.
It is all quite straightforward.
Aid is granted according to certain regulations.
The same should apply to territories.
I trust this will be the case.
It needs to be a policy on territorial cohesion.
We do not have any hidden agenda.
All this has resulted in real proposals for reforms.
Mr Karas was speaking just now about charity.
This policy is the expression of something else.
It symbolises a certain concept of Europe.
Cohesion policy ought to be symbolic.
These figures prove that this is a useful policy.
Mr Santini did the same for mountain regions.
As for Mr Segni, he spoke about islands.
There are also objective reasons.
What is at stake here really is very important.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon today.
The idea is very simple.
(Sustained applause)
That is an important task.
When autumn comes the birds fly to the south.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon today.
.
I particularly welcome two important features of this agreement.
Nevertheless, I thank you for your understanding.
Thank you for your attention.
This amendment is quite simply superfluous.
We trust the Commission.
The amendment is superfluous!
My group supports his work in all its aspects.
This principle of non-discrimination is vital for us.
That is also an important breakthrough.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon today.
.
The text is concerned with two points.
We have taken note of this guideline.
We have taken note of this argument.
We can take note of this suggestion.
It is also vital to accident prevention.
It is important to pay attention to training.
That is why this is very important.
Can this spell anything but disaster?
This is no longer a coincidence.
International shipping has been in trouble for decades.
Such collisions have unfortunately become common along our coasts.
The debate on this report is suspended.
It will continue at 3 p.m.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament approved the request for consultation)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(The President declared the common position approved)
(The President declared the common position approved)
Before the vote:
.
That is a significant step forward.
I commend it to the House.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
After the vote:
.
Mr President, I have a small oral amendment.
The committee still addressed its demand to the Convention.
.
.
Prevention is better than compensation.
This proposal clearly moves in that direction.
.
.
Why not?
.
.
.
.
We voted against this report.
.
.
Naturally we voted against this rapport.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
concentrate on underdeveloped and other acutely structurally disadvantaged regions;
strengthen inter-regional cooperation;
include the regional dimension in all EU policies.
Finally, the Mastorakis report includes worthwhile special proposals.
.
.
.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
This action would be neither practical nor productive.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you, Mrs Scallon
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.
The first concerns the personal aspect of the regulation.
.
It is parity of treatment.
Amendments have been submitted by all groups in Parliament.
That is absolutely essential.
The IGC changes that, and quite rightly so.
I am now going to list its blessings.
Cross-border workers.
Unemployment.
I do have sympathy for Amendment No 49.
How, though, do things stand in practice?
This has not been a success to date.
People will certainly be recruited from my area.
This receives my support.
Some measures contained in the report are particularly noteworthy.
This would clearly also involve reviewing the Maastricht criteria.
We also have a catalogue of problems.
This could represent a historical step forward.
I think that it is quite favourable in itself.
This shows that we must welcome this text.
Few feel up to the task.
Nevertheless, many problems still persist.
Fiscal regulations are another major problem area.
European coordination rules are lacking.
I should like to add this quite emphatically.
We must not delay the reforms unnecessarily.
Why?
Because a great deal of money is involved.
That is the first reason.
This is an outrage.
Why is this so?
I agree with that point.
It is true that it is not about harmonisation.
Its purpose is to extend and to modernise.
I think that is very important.
I do not myself believe that this will happen.
I must congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
This involves coordination and not harmonisation.
.
It is such a complex and difficult area.
However, the proposed text is too rigid.
A yearly declaration would be sufficient.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow
Would that be possible?
Mr Stevenson, I understand your position.
A mere adjustment is proposed for the intervening period.
Such arrangements are more flexible.
The amount involved is EUR 42.82 million per year.
They could also be beneficial to the Community.
The Community pays for these although nothing is caught.
It is encouraging that sensible steps have been taken.
I mentioned some of them.
More than a simple cosmetic review is needed.
That would be the ideal.
There are, therefore, no more paper-fish.
Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos has already pointed this out.
It represents an annual commitment of EUR 42.8 million.
Fishing remains crucial to the economy of Greenland.
These general reports should contain cost benefit analyses.
Have we been asked about them?
It should also allow for greater transparency and accountability.
We are in a good frame of mind!
It very often ends up in the wrong place.
We should review the whole situation.
The truth is something different.
That is where a very bad job was done.
That is why the stocks are run down.
What was everybody's business was nobody's business.
Greenland withdrew from the Union.
It should have stood its ground and maintained solidarity.
That is too generous.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Commissioner Lamy has the floor.
I have a second question.
Not all developing countries are the same, however.
The least-developed countries do not want them.
The second point is workers' rights.
We will carry on down this road.
My final point is in response to Mrs Frahm.
This was among our negotiating objectives in Doha.
Thank you Commissioner Lamy.
The other practical question concerns the blue box.
Are they in a position to do so?
Can you reassure us in this respect?
My second question concerns the mandate.
I referred earlier to the geographical factors for example.
Nonetheless, our main interests lie elsewhere.
Mr Cunha is right.
This process must operate within the multilateral system.
It is a simple one.
Take the example of sugar.
The sugar market has yet to be reformed.
The others urged us to reach an agreement.
We have responded to their request.
There is nothing surprising in this.
Decisions are not taken for them.
This is what compromise is all about.
This represents 10 % of the problem.
This is about supporting development.
It is about national governance.
The way ahead is open.
Thank you Commissioner Lamy.
I know there were legitimate requests to speak.
We will take questions to the Commission.
Part I
.
Mr President, this answer is certainly gratifying.
.
The European Union is absolutely clear about the position.
Subject: Operation Ulysses
.
Commissioner, thank you very much for your reply.
.
Subject: Additional Protocol on safeguarding nuclear material
.
.
Thank you very much Commissioner Patten.
Part II
.
So we can only estimate it.
.
I live in Perpignan, in North Catalonia.
I am afraid there might be further countryside revolts.
.
He should do so within the allotted time.
Is it possible to obtain these estimates?
.
.
Nothing about this is changed by the agricultural reform.
In less-favoured regions, there is much more.
Furthermore, your proposal is bureaucratically much more complex.
You are not replying to my question, Commissioner.
What does this mean?
(The President cut off the speaker)
.
I do not see a problem in that.
The reform stands.
It is you who must decide!
A one-word answer will suffice.
.
.
Subject: Development aid for Congolese agriculture
.
The Commission therefore has no information on this matter.
.
No, I cannot do that.
I have done what I could.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
.
Absolutely.
We have to keep trying.
Subject: Linking Kyoto mechanism credits to development cooperation
The EU also intends to hold emission rights itself.
.
.
.
This is where we are at the moment.
We have to be careful about that.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
.
.
That is where we are.
.
In practice that answer was very satisfactory.
I thank the Commissioner.
.
Those were also finalised in record time.
.
I was there immediately after the accident.
We have to work in collaboration.
Our civil protection unit was also activated immediately.
In its answer to my Oral Question H-0371/03
.
I thank the Commissioner for her substantiated reply.
.
We will continue to do so.
I cannot answer your question today.
Subject: NATURA 2000 site designation
.
Finland has endeavoured to address these shortcomings.
99 times out of 100 they were rejected outright.
People therefore feel frustrated and powerless.
They have simply been the victims of injustice.
.
The honourable Member has raised a very valid question.
We cannot find any such formal mispractice at all.
.
That is why it is a good one.
It is not my report.
It is a non-exhaustive list because of space.
We must be inclusive.
There are 600 million disabled people world-wide.
That also means protection from degrading and inhumane treatment.
That includes institutionalisation.
Then we look at civil and political rights.
Many do not have organisations of disabled people.
They only have organisations representing disabled people.
Are we going to exclude them?
We are not just dealing with the European Union.
This is a world-wide convention.
We share the same principles and the same objectives.
My final comment concerns the possible disability directive.
These are figures which give cause for thought.
This is a truly worldwide issue.
I congratulate the Commissioner on what she said tonight.
But what about People First and other self-advocacy organisations?
These prove her wrong.
We stand by the split vote.
This is extremely important.
This will be a great opportunity.
We can therefore imagine their quality of life.
This unborn life is also entitled to our protection.
There are some loopholes which must be closed.
You have said so yourself, Commissioner.
They wish to be as independent as possible.
Transposition is currently incomplete.
I refer both to special and mainstream education.
The two are not contradictory.
These areas are detailed in the report.
It is not a question of charity.
It is a question of rights.
This is the simple demand of disabled people.
But this is only half the story.
Today we talk about the rights of disabled people.
I regret this too.
Disabled people are vulnerable both physically and intellectually.
We need a convention to do that.
They have all failed to implement the framework directive.
Much, however, remains to be done.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
Its success will be measured in tangible results.
.
Let me now turn to the amendments.
Firstly, duration.
I will give you three examples.
This is clearly discrimination.
This is not an acceptable situation.
Thank you, Mrs McKenna.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
That is something we must combat.
This is an important period, however.
That is precisely what everyone has talked about.
The children were two and three years of age.
This story sends a cold shiver down the spine.
It highlights the importance of the DAPHNE II Programme.
No one would dispute the importance of DAPHNE II.
Today, we are talking about children.
Tomorrow, it could be old or disabled people.
Why is this an achievement?
We do indeed lack a legal basis.
The survey revealed a very simple fact.
There is a continuum of different types of violence.
The existence of this continuum should be acknowledged.
They have exposed a second problem.
The problems we face are already numerous and serious.
We must, however, be pragmatic and realistic.
We cannot waste time on protracted negotiations in conciliation.
It behoves us to take this matter seriously.
Thousands of women face the self-same fate every day.
This taboo must be broken.
Politics has an important role to play in this.
This is why we welcome the DAPHNE Programme.
DAPHNE I was a runaway success.
Hence the appeal for an increase in the budget.
Agreement has now been reached on 50 million.
Thank you, Mr President.
Knowledge about the projects is what is needed.
Which were successful?
DAPHNE II must succeed in mobilising public awareness.
I understand.
.
One already exists, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
Indeed, the House knows your discipline well.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The final point is the euro.
Thank you, Mr President.
A legal basis is urgently needed.
It risks jeopardising the work of Eurostat staff.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
EU-Cuba relations
I think this has to be made very clear.
.
I will merely say that we were not surprised.
.
The Commission is monitoring the growth of internal opposition.
Commission projects have been undertaken in this context.
The Cuban people are suffering.
Castro has provoked the EU.
What Cuba needs is democracy and freedom.
This means that we must stand united.
Aid needs to be transparent.
.
This is exactly what we are trying to do.
We have to have a presence there.
I shall now recall these proposals for you.
It will express and embody the common European interest.
Parliament's rights are also extended in budgetary matters.
This is, therefore, an open proposal.
(Laughter and applause)
Three solutions are then possible.
Let us be good sportsmen, however!
This could have serious consequences.
(Applause)
This ratification is by no means a foregone conclusion.
It must, therefore, adhere to specific rules.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Colleagues, your reaction speaks volumes.
.
We are therefore pleased with the end result.
A great deal has been achieved.
.
We undertake to prevent any such destructive attempts succeeding.
(Applause)
.
A great job well done and an unhoped-for result.
It therefore involves a new phase of political ownership.
(Applause)
This is a matter of facilitation rather than innovation.
This is definitely one of those times.
(Applause)
Why?
Because we have modified the institutional system.
We have modified it profoundly.
Our work has ended.
Now we have the Intergovernmental Conference.
Wer soll der HÃ¼ter der Verfassung sein?
[The guardian of the Constitution.
Who should the guardian of the Constitution be?]
The Convention did precisely that.
That now belongs in the past.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is our success.
The governments were represented at the Convention.
That is something we have to prevent.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
That is the great thing about this draft constitution.
That responsibility is ours.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is our destiny.
(Applause)
You are very welcome here.
That is what I have to ask of you.
(Applause)
Obviously, the name has changed.
Having a tortoise made of jade was felicitous.
Allow me to comment on your quotation from Montesquieu.
Democracy means choice.
Is that not a legitimate question?
I await your reply.
In this you will have our full support.
Now, where is the constituent power?
That is an outrageous claim.
What referendum, however?
At European level as a whole?
At national level?
That is a pity.
To a state or to an international organisation?'
Our peoples certainly want to see European cooperation.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
That is a crucial point.
Hence, balance must remain the reference point.
Rather, it is necessary to take the lead.
I believe that your three principles are sound.
You stated that this compromise was incomplete.
You raised the issue of qualified majority voting.
This point has not been raised.
I would cite the case of taxation.
We debated with them.
They were the subject of debates within the Convention.
Finally, you talked about natural disasters.
I now turn to MEPs' speeches.
It is the fruit of a joint effort.
There is no intergovernmental element.
That is not an intergovernmental procedure.
He was wondering about our constituent power.
Where, however, are the constituents?
It was composed of named people.
What is important in the constituent procedure is ratification.
The constituent is whoever ratifies.
He was in favour of the congress.
So was I, so we have both failed.
My last reply is to Mr HÃ¤nsch.
(Loud applause)
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
The result does not surprise us.
.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Before the vote:
The rapporteur is in agreement with this.
.
I would ask that the Spanish translation be changed.
We will ensure that all language versions correspond.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
Are you withdrawing the request for a split vote?
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
.
.
We ought to learn from it.
.
.
We also need to look to the future.
.
.
.
.
.
I need to get something off my chest.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Could they not have seen it coming?
.
Why is that?
.
.
.
.
I have therefore voted in favour of it.
.
.
.
The interest in wiping out poverty is hypocritical.
.
That is why it is important:
for discrimination to be abolished,
.
.
.
.
This is not a legally-binding document.
.
.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
.
There must therefore be increasing support for this objective.
The Presidency is making every endeavour to this effect.
The reconstruction of Iraq can and must be achieved.
.
A number of tributes were paid to him.
Our first priority was to provide humanitarian assistance.
Let me give one example of political reality.
Maybe I am wrong.
Maybe my political judgment is way off the mark.
But I do not think that it would be.
(Interjection from Mr Cohn-Bendit)
I am grateful for the endorsement of my colleague!
(Sustained applause)
Where is Secretary of State Powell's exit strategy?
Our message was: probably as both.
Not that I think he was a hero.
Far from it.
More is required.
The UN must become involved.
Where is that going to get us?
There is growing political support for this position.
Security issues are always best addressed collectively.
I wish you luck, Commissioner.
Yet guilty men and women are still at large.
Without that protection the UN agencies simply cannot function.
Unfortunately, what has happened is what we feared.
This is an extremely sad situation.
We know what that does.
It is the same with Iraq.
That is why Europe's hour has come.
We must provide help.
Look at the century we have just left.
What is all conflict about?
Difference in religion, nationality and race.
The answer to difference is to respect it.
It is an act of terrorism pure and simple.
.
I feel this is a necessary experiment.
.
You have to build democracy from the bottom up.
Secondly, we need reasonable security in Iraq.
It is not a very sophisticated point to make.
We need to ensure that the security situation improves.
We are at the beginning of a long road.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
Everything else is a 'pretext for evil'.
.
Political dialogue with third countries is still optional.
Religions are still being suppressed across the globe.
The objectionable caste system.
Children.
Every three seconds, a child dies of malnutrition.
.
This European activity targets a large number of countries.
.
First, through efforts in international fora.
Second, thorough dialogue with third countries.
This is a good, relevant reference.
However, the system is interesting.
I agree with Mr van den Bos.
That is precisely the goal of recent innovations.
Finally, I would make two remarks.
There is nothing but the conflict.
The other point I would make relates to torture.
We can support rehabilitation centres.
I thank you again for this comprehensive report.
Fundamentalism and intolerance are growing threats.
And what of our relations with third countries?
Our message is clear: these are our values.
If you support them we will engage with you.
Nor can we forget political preferences.
Is it not so convenient politically speaking?
Upholding human rights is not all that simple.
This also holds for freedom of conscience.
I therefore hope for wide support from this House.
Divided, we weaken our power for human rights.
We also warn against intolerance based on atheism.
This is an urgent matter.
It could be done.
Maybe then we would have some progress.
I hope the Commission will consider these in detail.
.
.
I only need make one final, general remark.
We have to remain multilateralist.
Everybody talks about the international society.
We do not have one.
We are trying to create one.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
This must be resisted.
Why should it be a lesson for us?
The final problem is equality.
Too much progress is still required.
.
.
My second comment relates to the countries.
That is the aim of the report.
Let us first look at the facts.
There is a slight problem though.
I refuse to believe that.
I wish to comment on three areas.
The second area is prison conditions.
The third area concerns a sensitive but important issue.
We cannot have this situation.
A simple suspicion can result in detention.
I think not.
This annual report contains yet again many painful areas.
What is it anyway, this principle of neutrality?
Our good name is at stake here.
That certainly happened during the summer heatwave.
(Applause from the right)
Personal comments have been made about the rapporteur.
I could reply in the same tone.
I am not going to do so.
Hurrah for the rapporteur!
We will gladly vote for the report.
I believe that some caution is called for.
Thank you very much to the rapporteur.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
We have inherited this delay from previous debates.
.
.
Subject: Operation Ulysses
.
.
That is a very good point.
.
.
.
Thank you Minister.
Subject: Competitiveness in the EU
.
His report rather smacks of complacency.
.
Will Italy therefore continue the eVote initiative?
What do you think of this idea?
Subject: Detainees in Iraq
Subject: Euro-Mediterranean dialogue and the status of women
Modernising such societies involves including women in democratisation processes.
and
In practice we are considering two related motions.
Three billion people have no access to sanitation.
I therefore urge you to support it.
However, the issues up for negotiation were different.
.
We are trying to do something about that.
This has an influence on the balance of water.
There is no such pressure.
That is the approach.
What does 'commercial' mean?
This is what makes things so extremely difficult.
It is too long-term and too expensive.
There are no quick profits.
We are nowhere near achieving that.
We know what to do there.
Please be realistic.
We are doing everything we can on that front.
That is the real battle.
I am still somewhat optimistic.
It has to succeed.
Why were no mosquito nets being produced in Africa?
We are taking the safe route.
I have cut across the themes.
The situation in the Middle East is explosive.
I cannot do that here.
This is with good reason.
There are quite a few sticking points there too.
Water management is a perfect example of this.
Mutual consultation and sound agreements could have prevented these.
That goes without saying.
We deem participation of the countries concerned highly important.
We therefore demand full involvement in its implementation.
I hope they will not be disappointed.
Secondly we need to make trade in general fairer.
Every second, eight people die of malnutrition.
We give two dollars a day to a cow.
In CancÃºn we can make a difference.
Well, I want to see them fight.
What are our lives about?
The free market does not actually exist any more.
UN figures prove it.
Proper globalisation is the way ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
No.
Everyone knows that it is quite simply about money.
It was easier to earn money that way.
A European fund is vital.
This will also mean increasing public funding.
Economic diversification is crucial.
It is a resource which must be shared.
His argument is that water is public property.
The Commissioner has explained this.
Then we will have fair trade.
There is only one answer: water.
Not democracy.
Not human rights.
Not medicines.
Nothing else, just water.
What a fantastic job.
This is what these people need.
Sadly, it is not enough.
Parliament needs to be involved.
I want this to happen.
That is the key to trade.
I hope he will do more.
.
This is not difficult to understand.
This is not an attempt to create one solution.
It is more like a facility.
This is a totally political judgement.
That is what we are trying to do.
There is no easy answer to that.
The reality of the market is here to stay.
The joint debate is closed.
.
In return, we send them just 1 300.
This is unacceptable.
That is simply inadequate.
That will not achieve results.
Diarrhoea diseases kill 1.5 million children a year.
We heard in the last debate about water.
.
That is one of the advantages of budget support.
I do not want to prolong the discussion ahead.
That, not least, must be avoided!
Women, too, are especially at risk.
It is true that a holistic strategy is required.
Ultimately, only the grandparents will be left.
Major vaccination campaigns are needed.
Preventive health measures need to be built up.
In the long term a preventive strategy is essential.
There is no lack of information from us.
They have a pain threshold.
Attention is focused on these three diseases.
There are two stages to this infectious disease.
In stage 2 the victim suffers fits and convulsions.
In this our positions do not differ.
The debate is closed.
.
They are crucial to us for four reasons.
Democracy and development go hand in hand.
We must, we should and we will.
.
In some countries these things are very new.
It is not our country.
There is a limit to our powers.
I am quite optimistic.
It is simply wrong.
It does not.
This is well understood.
It is possible to keep it that way.
This should be given more attention.
Certainly, the NGOs have got their act together.
Others are missionaries, particularly in Africa.
They provide substantial support for local communities.
But today I am going to focus on accountability.
I want to say one last thing.
He has my full support.
This communication should underpin real cooperation with non-state actors.
Who are these non-state actors though?
Who are these privileged partners?
Are they partners imposed on us?
On the contrary, they should encourage such activities.
They are funded from within Europe.
.
.
This works well and happens regularly.
We are entitled to expect better than that.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
.
We are learning year by year.
We started with a very difficult background.
So, getting started was very important.
First of all, it addresses many different audiences.
Following this dual purpose, there are conflicting demands.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
.
Announcement by the President
We have benefited from the European Union.
Parliament played a leading role in this.
We now have to decide how to achieve it.
The first concerns an Agency on Linguistic Diversity.
You should have received a copy.
Would the President like one?
President Roca, your copy awaits!
You can therefore forget any concerns regarding this issue.
I take the same view of minority languages.
.
I wish Mr Ebner well with his report.
We often talk about Europe's cultural heritage.
It is part of our very identity.
It is vital to safeguard and promote these languages.
Various resolutions have been adopted in this respect.
It was a sound initiative.
Language is an important key in this.
I am convinced that such an institute is needed.
Why?
We therefore know what has to be done.
I give you my word.
Linguistic diversity is being destroyed in Europe.
Let us try it at least!
The Presidency has no knowledge of this request.
Could you explain how this has happened?
Mr Wyn is from my group.
We would have had it translated for us.
So congratulations on this good report.
Sign language is not a crutch or a wheelchair.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
.
Today that figure is 2000.
Indeed, a thorough review is becoming urgent.
Plurality of media ownership is important for democracy.
This was also borne out by the consultation.
This aspect is thus being taken into account.
Full coordination is therefore needed here.
The dialogue has started.
It may be public.
I do have some remarks.
Excellent children's films have been made in Europe.
The Television without Frontiers Directive provides a negative definition.
We know what it is not.
The problem is defining the scope of audiovisual works.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
We are in a constituent phase.
Television must empower as well as entertain.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
.
The citizens also watch television programmes.
The internal market is growing.
They have to do with creation.
We need to look beyond it.
.
This was a depressing and alarming example.
Thank you.
The proposals are in keeping with the concerns expressed.
Their contribution to the Lisbon objectives is undisputed.
Thank you, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Thank you, Mr Turmes.
We take note of your statement.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
.
In this respect, public intervention is crucial.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The Spanish version will be corrected.
We shall now proceed to the vote on:
[I think that is perfectly clear].
(Parliament approved the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
That is very kind of you.
I will read it to you in English.
.
If not, we shall proceed to the vote.
(Mixed reactions)
(Applause from the right)
I would insist that the result was perfectly clear.
You did not do that Mr President.
(Applause from the right)
.
(Parliament approved the resolution)
Mr Turco is requesting the floor.
Is it on the same issue?
I will vote against this compromise.
Your observation is not therefore relevant.
In any event it has to be approved.
My concern is with torture.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(Parliament approved the resolution)
President.
Are there any objections?
The rapporteur is requesting the floor.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
.
.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is helpful too.
I hope that the Commission will take that up.
I rejoice in it.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
For some things, it is already too late.
.
.
We need to make different choices for our society.
.
.
We are still, however, sending contradictory messages.
.
I have voted against.
And why?
I object to this behaviour.
Rather, it is encouraged by the United States.
.
We had no part to play in this masquerade.
.
.
.
.
.
The regime will not let him.
It is our duty not to abandon him.
.
It was a violation of our rights.
.
Democratic politics is therefore never impartial.
It would be sensible simply to recognise this.
.
.
Oppressive dictatorships were backed for fear of mass rebellion.
.
.
I hope that they will never do it.
.
.
.
The following proposals are completely unacceptable:
passing European legislation on homosexual marriage;
.
.
.
(SV)
The report is defective in this respect.
Unaccompanied children must always be assigned reliable people.
Discrimination (page 48):
Trade union rights (pages 65, 101):
(page 97):
The Swedish labour market is regulated by collective agreements.
.

.
This report however, will not go unanswered.
.
.
.
Clearly, all this is but fantasy.
.
.
.
.
.
This is unfortunate.
.
.
.
Climate change will make this situation worse.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
I therefore agreed with most of this report.
.
We also have the financial means.
.
.
I voted in favour.
.
.
It also, however, has negative aspects.
.
.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
.
That says it in a nutshell.
I listened very carefully to what the Commissioner said.
I would like to touch on those.
This is not a new issue.
The situation cannot continue for two reasons.
We recognise there are difficulties.
Nevertheless, this practice still continues.
This illegal and incorrect practice nevertheless remains in place.
This is unacceptable.
Thank you, Mr President.
Now we all know the role that Hamas plays.
What freedom?
That, I will leave you to imagine.
The situation now, however, is radically different.
What type of cooperation is the Commission talking about?
In this way, new territories are being annexed.
There are precedents.
The legal settlements are the main obstacle to peace.
This colonial war claims more and more victims.
In Israel the situation is tragic.
This is a discriminatory and racist law.
In the occupied territories the situation is tragic.
That would be the answer.
In practice these are complex situations.
There is a wonderful climate.
.
Others have mentioned that Member States have to agree.
That is absolutely correct.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
.
I also thank Commissioner Nielson for his statement.
.
That is the source of the complication.
The debate is closed.
.
His report reflects broad agreement between us.
This is an internal EU discussion.
.
I support the need for reform.
It will lead to increasing transparency and accountability.
The main purpose of granting aid is poverty reduction.
Among the latter are many intergovernmental organisations.
.
The debate is closed.
I certainly hope it will not.
Hindus fear Muslims and Christians, particularly demographically speaking.
An escalation must be avoided at all costs.
The European Union should also look into this issue.
This is not, unfortunately, always the case.
That, of course, is the right response.
.
The joint debate is closed.
We recognise that more may be necessary.
Those troops are required as soon as possible.
We ask that these neighbouring states act with discretion.
.
We are still concerned about the ongoing fighting.
ECOWAS is doing what it is expected to do.
Some things were possible, but only very little.
This, unfortunately, is not the case.
The joint debate is closed.
Any remaining business contacts should be completely severed.
Burma is still the pariah of the international community.
The last time she was visited was in July.
The regime denies that.
No one has seen her since.
Political pressure should increase.
In the case of Burma, not very much.
We should use our liberty to promote theirs.
He has set the problem out very well.
There is an urgent need for immediate action.
.
The joint debate is closed.
The next item is the vote.
.
.
We must continue to give them our support.
in writing.
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
.
Resumption of the session
She was one of the very best.
She will be greatly missed.
She had daily contact with her two sons.
(Loud applause)
The following changes have been proposed:
Tuesday:
We in the Socialist Group back the motion.
This is a highly contentious issue.
Subsequently, changes were introduced to satisfy DG I.
Which is the request that you wish to stand?
The first petition came to us in 1997.
We need to vote on this.
(Parliament rejected the request)
So the report is then on the agenda.
The last issue appeared in May 2003.
Thank you, Mr Van Orden.
Mr President, I will be very brief.
It is our job to set an example.
We are tired of it!
We will see what we can do.
You are unanimous in that.
We will need to look at the detail.
That concludes the item.
.
That is the only thing we were working on.
What went wrong with the accident involving the Prestige?
What are they like?
Are we now establishing an effective system?
What happens to double-hull ships when they get old?
We must watch out for that very carefully.
We must make use of existing expertise.
The freedom of shipping is not absolute.
We must regulate shipping in congested and sensitive areas.
We must not criminalise the captain.
This is important.
Then there is the wreckage.
There is confusion about this.
Preparations are continuing.
The argument is about its mandate.
.
That is the first thing that must be said.
They have all responded, although inconsistently.
They refer to different interpretations of the Community regulations.
I feel that the outcome is important.
I trust that this discrimination will not continue.
It will be decided during another debate.
The security of fishing depends on it.
The Commissioner herself referred to ports of refuge.
There is a problem with port controls.
What will we have to say that is new?
It is not officially called a committee of inquiry.
Information from the people on the ground.
I believe that we must continue this work.
We therefore support the amendments tabled by Mr Sterckx.
The fuel oil is still reaching the beaches.
That is why we always participate in these debates.
They must remain on the political decision-making table.
These measures must not be forgotten.
The rapporteur deserves much praise for his report.
This is a completely different operation.
Unfortunately, it is not a new cry.
Indeed, what was the problem in this tragedy?
Was it the lack of places of refuge?
No, of course not.
What was the problem with this tragedy?
We will talk about that later.
That is what the minister says.
That is something we have said on numerous occasions.
The same applies to the cargoes transported from Murmansk.
The EU cannot attend to this alone.
The victims should be properly and fully compensated.
Openness is evidently still a difficult issue.
How unfortunate that expression sounds in this context!
Now we have new arguments.
These facts reopen the whole discussion.
They evidently think that that is beneath them!
Our group will support this.
Nunca mÃ¡is!
[Never again!]
There is an urgent obligation to clarify this matter.
What is position of the Member States'?
How reliable are double-hulled ships?
[Never again!]
Technology, though, is not the decisive factor.
We need port State control and classification societies.
Countries must have clear contingency plans.
I also would like to mention an example.
We all know the answer to these questions.
However, allow me to make a few comments.
That was the context of the report.
That is of no concern, however.
Ladies and gentlemen, read the documents.
It is important.
We need more support and action from the Commission.
I shall return to this in a moment.
Prevention is paramount.
What has become of this willingness to take action?
What we need is a task force.
Monitoring and adapting these proposals is our duty.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The Convention does not reflect present maritime reality.
I am happy to comply.
.
So there was a problem.
This is the information I have.
.
Let us be frank.
That was the situation, ladies and gentlemen.
The third issue is recovering oil.
Fourthly, cleaning ships.
There are two reasons for this.
The Baltic.
And they won the battle, through spectacular efforts.
They worked day and night.
Thank you very much for your words, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
.
The market is not always right.
Some of my amendments were rejected.
That is something I think worth noting.
The first problem is the proposal's legal basis.
Let me now turn to security of supply.
It will not!
The question does not even arise.
I can agree with it almost without reservation.
I think this is an unnecessary measure.
So I urge you to pause and think again.
That should give us pause for thought.
That will be the real problem.
What arguments would you use?
Madam President, it has been an interesting debate.
.
That is my intention, ladies and gentlemen.
That is not what we are talking about.
That is what I am advocating.
And that is what we are talking about.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Why?
2 of the proposal).
That was also stated in Thessaloniki.
What is the situation regarding this matter?
.
This is an initiative by a Member State.
That is still an open question at present.
That is what we all want.
The present situation is unsatisfactory.
Yes, we do need a legal framework.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
.
This report should assist in achieving that end.
That would be very ambitious.
I have made my position clear.
.
That is unacceptable.
Different countries have very different perceptions.
Sometimes transits through other countries prove necessary.
This can lead to people being deported.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 10 p.m.)
Appointment of the ECB President
.
Is this what we want?
Our second cornerstone is the independence of the ECB.
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
This dual policy is, therefore, necessary.
Europe must pull itself together.
We cannot confine ourselves to constantly calling for stability.
I wish to add three observations to this statement.
For the rest, I enjoyed his expertise.
You see, psychology is important in monetary policy.
The pact does not take this principle into account.
Good luck!
I think that would take us much further forward.
Then it would have greater validity and greater weight.
.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
.
That is not the case.
We do not want that.
The proposal rejects that.
Let me explain what I mean by that remark.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
The condition of technical innovation is essential.
Well done!
This is what we want to hear.
So what do we want?
We should be aware of this.
This directive achieves these goals.
That is regrettable.
I think that would be a bad thing.
We have submitted a number of amendments.
Why?
I think that would be a bad thing.
Now a few words about interoperability.
We have applied this distinction in our amendment.
Why are they doing almost the opposite?
Let us, therefore, stick with that.
We are not in fact without rights now.
I very much want to invite reflection.
We are talking about computer-implemented inventions based on software.
We all know the reality of the market.
Why?
Not at all.
This is the danger.
Say no to software patenting!
It is also the heart of the directive.
That is very important to us.
So be it.
That would be a real disaster.
I have some sympathy for that.
This is inherent in the patent system.
We are sorely aware of this.
I hope that trend will continue.
Patents are an indispensable part of that.
We therefore insist on this point.
Any form of software is explicitly excluded from patenting.
Only genuine inventions must be patentable.
This appears to contradict the Commission's objectives.
I do not understand what is going on here.
We are against this directive because it represents over-regulation.
The present protection offered by copyright is sufficient.
We Greens are often reproached as being busybodies.
That would be excessive.
I took every letter and every discussion very seriously.
Some fears are rooted in misinterpretations.
However, I do endorse some of the arguments.
We need this directive.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Copyright is more suitable.
Of course, copyright already protects software codes.
We support small-scale entrepreneurship in this sector.
There are very few absolutes in this debate.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Our rapporteur wishes to add a few words.
I have been bullied and harassed by lobbyists.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
My main arguments are as follows:
I am in favour of open interfaces.
This should also be possible in Europe.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
The Council agreed to nothing of the sort.
My committee accepted that proposal.
This situation cannot continue.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament rejected the Commission proposal)
President.
.
Parliament has rejected the Commission proposal.
.
.
I can assure you that it happens very infrequently!
(Laughter)
(Parliament agreed to the proposal)
Before the vote:
(Parliament agreed to the proposal)
Before the vote:
We now continue with the vote.
Before the vote on Amendment No 11:
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
(The President cut off the speaker)
It is therefore not accepted.
Before the vote on Amendment No 3:
, rapporteur.
I would therefore like to amend these two figures.
.
There should be no more shifts of this type.
Let us show some moderation!
.
The real reason is quite different.
.
The right of asylum must be unrestricted.
.
This is refoulement by another name.
This means choosing refugee camps over welcoming refugees.
.
What is there for the national governors to do?
.
.
.
That is why we voted against this report.
.
.
That ceiling is turning into a recipe for disaster.
.
This decision should not be endorsed, however.
.
This is what matters to Scotland.
.
.
There were more than 300 of them.
What a wonderful aroma there was, Mr President!
.
Both face inevitable decline.
.
Recent studies confirm this.
For that reason, I was forced to abstain.
There would have been a real problem!'
As a result, I voted for the motion.
.
.
.
.
So why do we need to build up stocks?
We do not worship at that altar.
.
.
That, however, is not the case.
That is why we abstained from the vote.
A dream, Mr President.
.
.
.
.
.
The only word to describe it is devastation.
That is the reason we voted against this report.
.
the creation of refuges for ships in distress,
frequent surveys of high-risk ships,
the creation of a special anti-pollution fleet,
the creation of special zones for ecologically sensitive areas.
.
.
.
They were:
These conditions are to be respected aboard ship;
setting up a European Parliament committee of inquiry.
.
There has been too much shilly-shallying.
I am in favour of such a development.
.
.
.
It must even become a priority.
.
Never again!
That concludes the explanations of vote.
I have a genuine procedural motion.
.
I suppose that we are now less confrontational.
This period has not been without its moments.
All those issues need to be resolved.
I will touch on that shortly.
We have to ensure that this is done correctly.
.
Now the budget in general.
Unnecessary expenditure is something we do not need.
What do we do about Iraq?
Perhaps the Council can say something about this.
.
We need to have a balance here.
I want to understand the Council's strategy.
However, we have a considerable margin in 2004.
My next question is to the Commission.
.
It is a good procedure.
Thank you for your attention.
It is going to be a turbulent year.
One is Commission reform.
It produced a very impressive numerical report.
Who knows?
The other point is the question of Iraq.
Certainly, this budget is equipped with fewer resources.
That is something which we will certainly do.
Who pays?
We pay from the taxpayers' money.
We wonder which of these figures is correct.
We will not get involved in this game.
They are the backbone of the European economy.
I agree with all the previous speakers here.
There must be equality.
We will monitor this very carefully.
This applies especially to foreign policy.
We have had to restructure.
460 billion!
Yet we spend just 37 billion on development.
We want to work preventively.
Nonetheless, we will focus more intensively on prevention.
The European continent is changing dramatically.
That has an impact on all institutions and agencies.
It will also have an impact on us.
The second is dependability.
This has long been our group's clear objective.
It will facilitate the monitoring of EU activity.
Administrative and operational costs are itemised.
The Commission is underrepresented in this parliamentary debate.
The Commission should have.
Our group takes a very critical view of that.
Thank you very much.
I mention this for your information.
What are the consequences of the reserves?
How can you use them in a positive way?
What happens when you discover this?
There are more examples like this.
That is throwing money away.
How does the Commission explain that?
What lessons has the Commission learned from this?
What is the Commission's response to this?
.
Others are suggesting an amount of EUR 500 million.
.
My committee finds this unacceptable.
.
I find it impossible to work on that basis.
Why has that been cut?
We want an explanation about Chernobyl.
.
It may perhaps be worth considering that possibility.
We hope this proposal will be approved.
This is unacceptable.
How do you intend solving this problem?
This is one of the most important aspects.
One is permitted to have doubts.
.
Mrs Figueiredo asked about the Forest Focus programme.
The answer to that is in the affirmative.
We appreciate that very much.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development regrets that.
The same applies to promotion, control and prevention.
We want 30 million extra for these two items.
How can this be justified?
Lastly I turn to CAP reform.
.
I take a favourable view of this.
Thank you for your attention.
We have had this discussion before.
Such a development we really would regard as crazy.
I strongly support this trend.
.
(Applause)
The main point concerns Eurostat and OLAF.
Finally, I turn to Eurostat.
Finland has announced its intention of joining.
.
That is fundamental.
The minimum necessary number has been proposed.
I only give praise where it is due ...
Expenditure in that area is neither excessive nor decorative.
It is absolutely essential to good performance.
This budget is in fact the first activity-based budget.
How to improve activity-based management is a continual challenge.
This measure must be implemented as soon as possible.
I could give you many other examples of this.
.
It was not quite as complicated on this occasion.
That will be very welcome.
We acknowledge where further development needs to take place.
I am impatient for further change.
I want to see total implementation.
I do not ask for that for one second.
.
I rise to do two things.
I would certainly not repeat that.
We need people!
Do not take it personally Commissioner.
It was just a general remark.
Commissioner Barnier is well aware of the matter.
the 2000-2006 programmes,
the closure for the period 1994-1999, and
the structural policy consequences of enlargement.
My second point is the 1994-1999 closure.
This closure will in fact be longer than expected.
Cohesion policy is also a top priority.
What are the budgetary effects of this enlargement?
That is an increase of around 20%.
Time passes and nothing changes in this.
That is a matter for reflection.
This is therefore worth investigating more carefully.
I myself do not expect this at all.
What can we see happening?
I think we should put a stop to this.
Let us have less padding and more quality.
Mr Pronk, I have answered your question.
Thank you.
.
The public learn about Europe through television.
This year Parliament voted EUR 3 million for Euronews.
I hope the Commission will take these points seriously.
I would like to draw your attention to that.
What have we done?
You raised the question of the legal bases.
I have nothing but full confidence in that programme.
I welcome this project.
There was one matter that was left.
The same applies to the Economic and Social Committee.
We want it down by the same percentage again.
We want a further reduction to 46%.
Mr Vitorino, I therefore rely on your courage.
Thank you, Madam President.
There must be at least two partners.
As simple as that.
.
.
On the whole, it has gone quite well.
However, occasionally we have strayed from the subject.
Thank you, Mr Wynn.
The debate is closed.
Thank you for your question, Mr Harbour.
That was a perfectly normal decision.
I understand the feelings of the trade unions perfectly.
End of quotation.
'French industrial giant Alstom saved!'
'Alstom shares fall after initial rescue.'
'Paris urges Alstom industrial conglomerate to restructure.'
'Battle for the future of 110 000 jobs.'
Anything that goes against EU law must be prohibited.
All discrimination is banned.
Commissioner Monti is its independent regulator.
Such arrogance is no longer tolerable.
That is what will happen in the immediate future.
I shall mention three of these.
Ought we to have blind faith in you?
The answer is 'no'.
I do not see any clear industrial policy.
You have won then, but at what price?
You are not a lawyer, Mr Monti.
The support package amounts to EUR 2.8 billion.
That is the reality.
We need to support Alstom.
The uncertainty over the aid is not helpful.
We are not doing that.
We must give them some form of certainty.
.
This is the task of state aid control.
Thank you Mr Cashman.
The debate is closed.
The sitting is suspended until 9 p.m.
.
We consider such accusations to be unfounded.
Poverty is our main problem in the social sphere.
Romanian society has grown up.
Thank you, Mr President, for that address.
We thank you for your presence.
.
Here also, I fully agree with you.
Payments will also be made as promptly as possible.
.
I will deal with those last.
The converse also applies.
The worst offenders are not DG SANCO.
In conclusion, this is a modest proposal.
I therefore want to say thank you to Phillip.
Does it give value for money?
The definition of such bodies must be strict.
The expansion in the sphere of competence is important.
We must go further, however.
That is the real consumer protection policy.
They know who they are.
This is as it should be.
They are quite wrong.
.
We have been making progress on this issue.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.
We think that the Commission's communication is sound.
The Commission has carried out a sound analysis.
We have a number of viewpoints.
Pensions systems still reveal a lack of equality.
There is good reason to address these problems.
We must show solidarity with future generations.
We are not interfering with the statutory pensionable age.
There are many reasons for this.
We shall then also address the subject of enlargement.
We have enjoyed sound cooperation in the committee.
We agreed on three lines of approach.
.
There is also the issue of equal treatment.
Indeed the vote in the committee was not unanimous.
I am stating the facts as they are.
The report is not a disaster.
It is a first step.
Milan meets MalmÃ¶, if you like.
This is dangerous.
There is some confusion in certain quarters on that.
I believe we should show that we recognise this.
It is, after all, the reality.
His report deserves support from across this House.
He certainly has mine.
Clearly there is a need for both.
Nevertheless we expect it will arrive.
There is a need to address that issue.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.
.
The text of the directive is littered with them.
Both instruments can co-exist and complement each other.
It is time we were serious about its implementation.
In practice it is sorely needed.
Europe needs an ambitious energy taxation system very quickly.
.
Thus far about the amendments.
It is regrettable, but it is the reality.
In order to produce hydrogen one needs electricity.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.
.
The issue of data storage also requires further attention.
Six to seven years is still far too long.
the required conditions for data protection;
the reason why the data is collated;
strict time limits for the storage period;
adequate information to the people in question;
and methods of rectifying any errors in the data.
In my view, the solution is two-pronged.
.
First, I will touch upon purpose limitation.
The second date is 15 March 2003.
That is certainly going too far.
What are our specific problems?
The debate is closed.
.
.
The ISD should not prescribe a particular market structure.
It should properly distinguish between retail and professional investors.
This compromise should be accepted as a package.
I believe it will be good for consumers.
Supply and demand must be maintained.
Thank you, Mr President.
Rules always regulate conflicting interests.
That would just be more expensive.
We view this as rather risky.
Later she accepted it.
Were these two philosophies compatible?
In this respect the Commission text was very satisfactory.
This statement is however subject to two reservations.
The first concerns the issue of price improvement.
Of course he should have the best price!
The Commission proposal provides for pre-trade and post-trade transparency.
I think that this is excessive.
Transparency is therefore essential.
Why do we even need a directive?
Firstly, investor protection.
Thirdly, we want the best possible service.
I should like to outline two objectives.
Secondly, protecting small private investors.
As we know, markets cross borders.
.
We consider that 60 amendments have to be rejected.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.
(The sitting was closed at 12.05 am.)
European Constitution and IGC
This is an error which must be corrected.
Otherwise, new consensus cannot be achieved.
We are not abandoning those goals.
I have mentioned this Parliament's sense of responsibility.
.
Perhaps that is a contradiction?
First reason: constitutional texts are not static.
I wish it luck in times of storm.
It is a challenge for everybody.
It has fulfilled its contract.
There is, however, no time for nostalgia.
This final stage represents a considerable challenge.
This could be a first.
I was deeply involved in those Conferences.
There is also the hierarchy of rules.
I hope they will be retained.
Attacks of this nature are always a possibility.
This ties in with the principle of subsidiarity.
Let me make one final observation.
I hope that the Italian Presidency can do so.
I believe we must state the facts clearly.
That cannot be the case.
This corresponds to reality at this moment.
The Convention was successful when it was free.
Did they not brutally force through their positions?
Were you not at the Convention, Commissioner Barnier?
Did you not agree to a great compromise?
Let us heed Robert Schuman carefully, though!
There was not one vote, however.
Not a single vote.
It would mean a blow against Robert Schuman.
What do we see there?
Another blow against Schuman.
What does this amount to?
We did not even attempt to respond to this.
That is not enough.
That is something I would very much welcome.
.
.
Mr President, the fisheries sector is in crisis.
.
Fortunately, things went well in the end.
We should be going back to first principles.
That is a dangerous message in election year.
I shall mention a couple of these conditions.
It is quite simply splendid.
That is a matter of political and legal obligation.
This will become clear shortly in the IGC.
However, the small states are also our allies.
It therefore deserves to be adopted by the IGC.
There are dangers lurking.
That would be a form of cultural imperialism.
Both proposals are the wrong ones.
One of these is the reform process.
That is impossible.
Are we going to impose them on our citizens?
This is the revision clause.
Constitutions are never amended by unanimity, however.
A new clause will be needed to facilitate progress.
The draft Constitution already has many such clauses.
The report itself is extremely weak on this point.
We have no right over the future of others.
Article 4.7.3 must therefore be amended.
The Convention was a success.
The Senator is most welcome to the House.
We know how to discover the will of states.
It is represented by governments and national parliaments.
The reason is that the Convention worked undemocratically.
It is the issue of federalism.
Under the Constitution the EU will become militarised.
Thank you.
As a Constitution, this text aspires to permanence.
The responsibility they bear is thus much greater.
I am not very confident about all this.
Our demands were a model of moderation.
You will not refuse us entry.
However, the result still deserves our support.
Is God not above the law?
How can Liberal government parties endorse this?
I myself am a great supporter of a referendum.
I should like to thank both rapporteurs.
Let us give Europe back to the citizens.
The first remark relates to the identity of Europe.
There are two possible solutions.
Either nothing is changed or everything is.
I shall now test it out.
This is a technical point but it is important.
The second issue concerns the status of the Charter.
It is therefore best to leave well alone.
The third issue is that of God.
This is a crucial point.
Lastly, there is the issue of price stability.
I wish you good luck.
The Commission has appreciated the danger.
It would undermine the collegiate system within the Commission.
The totally unsatisfactory status quo remains.
The lesson of Iraq must be learnt.
The German and Greek legislatures have similar arrangements.
Will enough decisions be taken by majority vote?
Will the small Member States lose out?
Are they able to directly elect the Commissioners?
In essence, will there be more direct democracy?
Are our much-valued European regions not left out?
What about the right of appeal?
There is, of course, criticism.
Mr President, I will be very brief.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
There is considerable doubt surrounding all this, however.
This has now been universally recognised.
This concerned how to overcome the democratic deficit.
National governments are the genuine representatives of their people.
He referred to the substance.
There is no further debate today.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This amendment merges my original Amendments 110 and 16.
The debate on her report closed yesterday evening.
The rest would stay the same.
I would ask twelve Members to rise.
Down with the imperialist war and occupation!
Quite the opposite is the case!
.
That is why we voted against the recommendation.
.
Two elements in particular are typical of this opinion:
We leave them to the judgment of our peoples.
Of course I have voted against it.
This is a great disappointment, especially for consumers.
This is why we eventually voted against the report.
Rather, it is often used by big companies.
They protect commercial monopoly instead of intellectual property.
This is why I voted against the directive.
.
I voted against the directive.
.
We await a common position from Council and Commission.
.
.
That is why I voted against it.
In the final vote, we voted in favour.
There is, therefore, no guarantee of continuity.
I am equally concerned about the operational costs.
That is a terrible cost-benefit ratio.
.
EUR 72 million have been allocated to this end.
.
.
.
We have grave reservations about this directive.
.
.
.
.
.
.
These good intentions soon, however, become meaningless.
This is why we voted against this report.
.
.
.
This is why we voted against this report.
Awaiting something better, I abstained.
That was not the case yesterday.
The EU must be limited and effective.
It is the Member States that own the Treaty.
.
On behalf of Mr Antoni Macierewicz:
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
The stakes, however, are high.
The container and the contents concern us all.
.
These are all questions that remain to be resolved.
.
.
.
.
Parliament rejects this.
.
That concludes the vote.
We are committed to achieving this as a priority.
What should our strategy be?
Is this still possible?
We must go further.
End of quote.
End of quote.
Greater engagement with Israel might help in this.
However, we can have no truck with terrorism.
It cuts through the very heart of Bethlehem.
The separation wall will not solve the problem.
Israel is a friend on the wrong track.
Who can help this friend at this stage?
Is it still serious about the roadmap?
We believe that both camps must disarm.
The United States is asking for support for Iraq.
He did so behind closed doors.
How do we go on from here?
We here are a political body.
We are not judging intentions.
This is not a positive development.
We must send out certain positive messages.
The road map is a plan in three phases.
There is no phased plan to peace.
For what is left of it?
It has been shot to tatters from all corners.
In that case, there will be no peace.
Every nation is entitled to its own home.
An old man died at the checkpoint.
On what list are we going to put that?
They fear and distrust each other too much.
It can work, if it gets time.
There is nothing else in sight.
It is exceedingly urgent.
These are the people who warrant our support.
What could they bring that might break the deadlock?
Perhaps Palestine could re-examine the status of her intifada.
It is an armed intifada.
The answer to that is 'no'.
Most intifadas are popular and peaceful intifadas.
What about Israel?
What contribution are we making to that?
What contribution can we make to it?
What can Europe do?
Just blacklist Hamas?
I do not think that is enough.
This was too much, however!
Serious mistakes have been made.
That is the Parliament's task.
We must work on what Europe is doing.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
Where did we go wrong?
Europe really did work as a team!
Secondly, who is to blame for that?
Thirdly, did Europe do everything it could?
Why did the fifth Ministerial Conference fail?
These are two questions which are relatively similar.
The second question is: who is to blame?
Could we have done more?
We wish not to impose but to persuade.
We believe not in deceit but in clear agreements.
The second debate is the WTO reforms.
How and where?
So what was CancÃºn about?
This is really self-evident.
How did this come about?
And whose fault was it?
That is a somewhat abstract proposition.
Concessions can, however, only go so far.
Do our partners share that preference?
Why do I say that?
What, exactly, was on offer?
That is not all by a long way.
We followed the discussions on agriculture.
I think this is quite a bad omen.
We are witnessing a hesitant global economic recovery.
Then there is the G-21.
Where do we go from here?
The rules of the game should be broadened.
This is why global rules for protection are necessary.
Stubborn bilateralism is not the way forward.
And this while the developing countries lost out!
The Union was under no obligation to go further.
My second question is: what should we do?
We need to breathe new life into the round.
Did it not negotiate naively before the negotiations?
What is more, causing loss of interests ?
(The President cut off the speaker)
The atmosphere when the meeting started was cautiously optimistic.
What, then, went wrong?
It was mainly a matter of the timetable.
We have to move forward.
The players involved are no longer the same.
There were two southern blocs at CancÃºn.
This defeat is that of the European institutions themselves.
The Group of 21 has 21 negotiators.
What is to be done, then?
What is to be done about cotton?
You say we have to change medieval procedures.
Which means that the institutional question is much broader.
I think that we are all to blame.
I have a particular thought for this issue.
We are being asked for transparency and clarification.
All that is true.
That is the question European farmers are asking themselves.
I think there is a lot in that.
I would like to congratulate the Commissioners.
Unfortunately I have no more time left.
Who was to blame?
That would be a pity.
Which rules, though?
This implies two twin demands.
There are different strata in both groupings.
Countries' trade potential will develop at different speeds.
Successes for the future depend on flexibility of timing.
Now we must have a complete reassessment of procedures.
The process, therefore, is clearly unsustainable.
Intra-capitalist oppositions are becoming more acute.
We must not, I feel, be masochistic.
It could go further, of course.
This debate is dragging on.
I agree with you.
I think it is too early to say.
Several options will need to be considered.
I also agree with it.
I thank him for his words on parachutes.
However, they were scuppered.
This is an essential point to consider politically.
But who will really benefit from this failure?
They urgently need a debate of that kind.
Secondly, on the Singapore issues.
It was still an excellent proposal.
So what role did the United States play?
.
I do not think there is any alternative.
I think that would be nonsensical.
We need to dismantle the barriers here.
We therefore need to consider all this very carefully.
It does not mean moving towards an extreme position.
The developing countries are organising and asserting themselves.
The same applies to priority works.
We had the Essen Council.
In this way development too is undermined.
The proposals and plans are on the table.
Here is a practical example.
It is therefore important to appropriate more funds.
Trade and the internal market need these cross-border networks.
We are lacking interconnected gas and electricity networks.
Often, infrastructure decisions collide with ecological considerations.
Europe is suffocating under its contradictions.
The United States is much more pragmatic.
This would benefit sustainable development too.
I would like this minuted, please.
Mr Goebbels and others have already referred to this.
Credit financing alone will not suffice.
The Commission was therefore not expected to be present.
The debate is closed.
The reverse is true.
You are not, but imagine that you are.
That is simply not possible.
I should like to tell one final anecdote.
Public sector information is a key content resource.
The Commission can accept all the amendments.
Harmonisation is needed in this area too.
Not all documents are printed exclusively on paper anymore.
He has extracted the best out of the situation.
Fine words.
We have to follow things through.
Let us protect ourselves against tendencies of that kind.
I wish to thank him for that.
This is an important area.
That is a lot.
This market is worth more than EUR 400 billion.
Would the chance of a little charity not help?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
There are many others.
Because the dates are crucial.
The first pillar is the regulatory framework.
That is the first pillar.
That is the very important second pillar.
In particular, what price are we to pay?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
That mystifies me absolutely.
Let me begin with some items in my report.
Let me raise some issues that need highlighting.
Every request must be considered on a case-by-case basis.
This needs to be reviewed.
We have not got it right.
.
I agree with him.
In other words, time for reflection is needed.
Clearly, therefore, progress is being made.
Mr Cashman rightly pointed this out.
It was therefore impossible to be specific.
This would facilitate comparisons.
Some problems remain.
Mr Cashman made this clear at our meeting yesterday.
The rapporteur indicated as much.
This needs to be borne in mind.
This is an area closely linked to transparency.
Mrs Maij-Weggen is leaving the House.
I offer her my congratulations.
We tend to be criticised for being distant.
I would like to add my voice to his.
It is true that much remains to be done.
There is certainly a good deal of work outstanding.
Mr Cashman's initial proposal is indeed too ambitious.
It is not possible to go that far.
What do you need?
Progress has definitely been made.
Guaranteeing access is not sufficient.
I think that that is a good idea.
This morning, we voted on the McCarthy report.
I should like to thank him.
It concerns harmonisation of the Member States' legislation.
Certain areas really must be discussed.
It must not be too difficult.
We have also developed a friendship.
I should like to make a few brief comments.
Simpler and more comprehensive registers are needed.
The Commission should have one register, not several.
Openness must be the rule rather than the exception.
We need to improve in this institution too.
.
I welcome their comments on this our common endeavour.
I endorse the Vice-President's statement.
We have engineered a revolution.
Today, we are debating the Cashman report.
By contrast, Parliament records all requests.
Well over 90% of requests received positive responses.
No information was provided for other requests.
Clearly, the process needs to be improved.
That is the case here and in all countries.
It even happens in countries boasting of maximum transparency.
Some documents are not really documents as such.
They cannot be released.
I might not even be present myself.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
.
The logic is, indeed, very simple.
In addition, there is an issue of labelling.
I will not go into them all.
Environmental and consumer protection have the highest priority.
It is an important environmental directive.
Vegetation and agricultural crops are also damaged.
These measures have produced good results.
We have therefore submitted proposals to right this wrong.
Much greater stress should be laid on working conditions.
There is still time to correct that mistake now.
What they are based on cannot be determined.
I wish to thank and congratulate the Commission.
It is going to reduce ground-level ozone.
It is going to cut plant damage.
It is going to reduce other environmental effects.
This is an issue we cannot ignore.
We have to go forward with it.
Let us have those options available to people.
Let the market be free.
Let us have some competition.
There are many old buildings in Britain.
The Commission agrees with the principle underlying these amendments.
That is Amendment No 11.
That concerns Amendments Nos 6, 19 and 22.
This is not acceptable to the Commission.
Thank you for your explanation, Commissioner.
There was one thing I did not understand.
Could you clarify this for me once more?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The Commission has agreed to host the Coalition secretariat.
This integration is difficult for many reasons.
We can take this Parliament as an example.
Allow me to give a practical example.
We lack clear objectives and clear indicators.
We need more aid, but also better aid.
I was there.
Environmental breakthroughs were achieved in Rio.
That is a good thing.
Improvements have to be made at the same time.
We must not forget that.
These are the three cornerstones of a better world.
Sustainable development has developed over time.
One example is climate policy.
Another example is pharmaceutical legislation.
It does not have to be this way.
This brings me to the second point.
What have we been doing?
I should like to thank Members for their contributions.
That has been a problem within the Council.
Thank you Commissioner.
Those peoples are the foundations of the Community edifice.
Welcome
I commit myself to pursuing this goal vigorously.
However, I have one or two points.
We are here to serve the interests of citizens.
There is a second question, moreover.
The second follow-through dossier is being prepared.
That framework cannot be ignored.
Two matters of this kind are currently at issue.
Thank you very much for these suggestions.
Thank you, Mr SÃ¶derman
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
I am not in favour of nominalism.
It does not really present any new difficulties.
It must be intensified and strengthened.
We already miss her here in Parliament.
I think it has been a successful year.
We shall also debate bush meat and multiple sclerosis.
It refused to pay.
I too congratulate the Commission staff and officials.
They respond very well to our requests.
Unfortunately, the Council is not quite so agreeable.
That is a shame.
I heard what Commissioner de Palacio said.
I thank Mrs GonzÃ¡lez for her work.
We never turn a blind eye towards it.
They produce concise and straightforward responses in plain language.
Of course, differences and divisions do exist.
Misunderstandings must be resolved first.
That will make discussions a great deal simpler.
It has no right of codecision, however.
I thank all the honourable Members for their work.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(2002/2208(INI)).
.
He sent long questionnaires and received responses.
Was the directive being applied then?
He has to bring a Member State into compliance.
I hope the Commission will give formal answers.
Let me be clear.
In both cases Mr Diamandouros found no maladministration.
I therefore do not intend to criminalise anybody.
That is why I cannot support this report.
It fails to give a balanced assessment.
The report states that directives have not been implemented.
This is an opinion.
It has not been proven.
Let me quote the relevant section of his letter.
I will finish on this.
It is about getting an answer for our citizens.
We have to provide answers for our citizens.
We are curious.
This matter is not going to go away.
The UK Government denies this allegation.
These are complex legal issues.
And Mr Cashman contests Mr Perry's information.
What emerges from this?
That is our only concern.
What emerges from this?
They should not therefore be debated separately.
And the Commission has indeed been neglectful.
Thus, I shall raise the more general concern.
But just what is the so-called Lloyd's scandal?
A few even took their own lives.
That is what I would like to say.
Mr Cashman has the floor.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the vote.
.
We now continue with the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
The rest remains unchanged.
The original form, however, is not admissible.
(Interjection by Mr Pannella)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Protests from Mr Pannella)
President.
We can discuss it later, Mr Pannella!
It is done now.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote on the resolution as a whole:
That has been agreed.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
I supported Mrs Read's report.
It will also promote the dissemination of good practice.
This runs counter to transparency.
I trust Mrs Villiers will take this into account.
The problem is that sometimes these judgments are marginal.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work.
I congratulate Mr Lisi on his excellent report.
In particular, it fails to state that:
The Commission bears much of the blame for failure.
It simply refuses to communicate with them;
Nonetheless, I am against unregulated globalisation.
This latest alarm call was needed.
That was the formula that kept those countries poor.
They can now offer some resistance.
It is a question of setting a different course.
No leadership will last if it is not credible.
Mr President, I cannot support the Perry report.
This is an internal British squabble.
They should be ashamed.
This is going to run into the sand.
We should not be spinning and pretending otherwise.
The report also contains errors of fact.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Why is that the case?
That is the first issue.
No exceptions can be allowed.
Hence the relative complexity of the measure.
Thank you for your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
Brokers in the arms trade are quite unique agents.
We are familiar with the various scandals.
Thank you very much, Mr Leinen.
We need to convert war industries into peace industries.
These are the demands of the movement for peace.
Even that, however, is proving impossible.
Naturally, we are opposed to this report.
Mr President, Commissioner, so much is clear.
We cannot jolt our governments' consciences.
European arms exports are clearly rising instead of falling.
I do not acknowledge that possibility.
Admittedly, its effects have been somewhat uneven.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Commissioner Barnier has the floor.
Funds are granted only to the best proposals.
Some aspects clearly overlap.
The President ordered that the speaker be cut off.
That is correct practice, democratic practice.
All our words will be included in the Minutes.
I would urge you to rethink.
We exerted the greatest possible pressure.
However, we soon realised our mistake.
The debate is closed.
The Commission is itself following the matter very closely.
Let us not stop there, either.
You mentioned the ecosystem, Mr Berthu.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on 9 October 2003.
I should like to congratulate her on her appointment.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
President.
That concludes the vote.
Even that, however, is proving impossible.
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 4.40 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
(1)
They get very few answers.
I hope they will sign it.
Thank you for raising the matter.
This coup was carried out against an elected president.
Almost 100 000 people attended.
Â Â  That concludes the item.
There are two basic reasons.
Three factors have come together.
How would this make EU aid more effective?
What arguments could be put forward opposing the proposal?
Thank you very much.
How can we provide that kind of guarantee?
How could this be guaranteed within the budget?
Â Â  That concludes the item.
This, in itself, is exceptional.
In many cases, this is not the case.
These characteristics have to be borne in mind.
Nevertheless, we must not oversimplify matters.
Let us talk about the professions then.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.(1)
The agency will not replace national border guards.
We must therefore give our economy fresh impetus.
We must direct investment towards growth.
This is something I have never done before.
We know how that ended.
Here I am addressing the President of the Commission.
I can only advise against such a step.
It is investment that creates jobs.
The issue must therefore be addressed more directly.
Can we not tackle the problems using existing structures?
I am just airing the question now.
Concentrate on the three or four key points.
It is the top priority for these six months.
Why?
Well, nothing is being done.
We are moving very slowly.
An analysis is made and what can be done?
This is a step.
What can the other be?
It may be a great European loan.
Why not?
Then Rome really will be the eternal city.
But we need to move beyond bold declarations.
This is the crux of the matter.
Where does the phased plan lead?
It is a road to nowhere.
We must take action.
They are the victors.
Can we still keep the Association Agreement in operation?
The European economy needs to be reinvigorated.
Better late than never, however.
What adjustments can be made?
You referred to the market in electricity.
Investment, though, would make for increased growth.
Let me just say something brief about foreign policy.
Neither is implementing it more flexibly.
Such a measure is urgently needed.
Do you know why it worries me?
This leaves me entirely perplexed.
I really do not understand this.
I hope that will change at the summit.
This, though, is where the problem lies.
Â Â  Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
And that is the real situation.
The group of European correspondents undertook major preparatory work.
The Commission finds the agreement to be extremely satisfactory.
The lines that we then defined are now confirmed.
I unreservedly endorse this course of action.
No agreement is perfect.
It is a bit of a mixed bag.
There are many strands in the effects of legislation.
Legal certainty is a myth and an illusion.
What an absurd view.
It is not true.
This is what makes subsidiarity so important.
It is right that he should do that.
However, the task should not be underestimated.
I will not hold my breath, Mr President.
It seems however, that only four were completed.
Only then perhaps will its usefulness become apparent.
Let us hope it is the former.
What, therefore, are the crucial points?
The first is, of course, democracy.
Fourthly there is proportionality.
We should lead by example.
It is right that the legislative authority should decide.
Thank you very much, Mr Corbett.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow from 11 a.m.
Space science has played a pioneering role.
Some crucial points of convergence have materialised.
We must now find a more structural solution.
Thanks to new technologies, it provides new opportunities.
Let us then take up this challenge!
I believe that this is an altogether remarkable document.
I should like to address two issues.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr PiÃ©trasanta.
We cannot separate one from the other.
What peacekeeping operations does it mean?
But that cooperation cannot be subordinate.
Under no circumstances must it be subordinate.
Mutual collaboration, yes, but subordination, no.
Now for my minute on space travel.
It does not actually work out like that.
How are the two kept separate?
Similarly, the GMES programme will be implemented.
There is only research â full stop.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Busquin.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11Â a.m.
Firstly, there is the position of the workforce.
We have developed concrete proposals to this effect.
This is the problem of multiple notifications.
I cannot agree with that opinion.
The market is changing.
Amendment No 37 contains words to this effect.
Particularly Amendments Nos 40 and 41 concern this topic.
This ties in with the other amendment I mentioned.
We therefore endorse the Regulationâs objectives.
A second point is the definition of the market.
Here, you are confusing apples with pears.
The new structures that result make for more conflicts.
I warn you against over-regulation.
That is very much to be wished.
Â Â  .
Why do we think that this change is needed?
That much is clear.
Why?
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Monti.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11Â a.m.
The proposal contains both technical and organisational requirements.
In tunnels, people feel shut in.
Let me start by pointing them out.
My final task as rapporteur is a thankful one.
I believe that he deserves particular credit for this.
Thank you for that!
The vast majority recognise their enormous advantages.
And neither that they are essential to both parties.
France has a similar tradition.
The choice is not difficult.
That much is true.
Third, the agreement should promote sustainability.
Any other consideration is secondary.
This is not acceptable.
It clearly is now.
But that is not enough.
We have to take that into account.
I am talking in particular of Mauritania.
What is the response from the Commission?
All these issues concern many MEPs.
My concluding remarks can be relatively brief.
What do we actually mean by a partnership agreement?
That is what we intend to ensure in future.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
It has indeed already proved its worth.
The last few weeks amounted to a respite.
They were characterised by tense calm.
Sadly, that calm proved all too fragile.
Life after life is still being lost needlessly.
I will begin with the RoadÂ Map.
I believe the concern expressed is justified.
The RoadÂ Map sets an ambitious objective.
It remains the focal point for all peace efforts.
These individuals are resident in the area.
Closer cooperation of our efforts will also be fostered.
He might have succeeded by now.
This wall encroaches into territory beyond the 1967 borders.
Israelis and Palestinians need a chance to renew cooperation.
Indeed it is its duty to do so.
That is the bottom line.
Clearly, the next few weeks will be decisive.
This applies in particular to the UnitedÂ States.
The road to peace will be long and difficult.
That has already become apparent.
Its actions also need to be creative and consistent.
Is there any hope?
Unfortunately, this hope has not become reality.
This must be made very clear.
â¦ involving Europeans would be a way forward.
Now, of course, the development must continue.
We Europeans should therefore launch a genuine initiative here.
There are no second-class people.
MrÂ AbuÂ Abas represents this approach.
I believe the Quartet must continue its work.
I wish you well, gentlemen.
You can count on our support.
Sanctions will certainly not help to improve the situation.
This is a threat.
Careful consideration should be given to the latter.
There is nothing to be gained from the latter.
I believe this matter deserves attention.
He cannot.
It is an obscenity that must be stopped.
That would be my first point.
Here is my suggestion.
Think of Haifa!
All terrorism is reprehensible, regardless of its origin.
I agree with MrsÂ Morgantini on this.
Control of the security forces is required, obviously.
MrÂ AbuÂ Mazen was unsuccessful in this regard.
We must believe in ourselves.
I broadly endorse MrÂ Poetteringâs remarks also.
This consensus was referred to earlier in the House.
The terrorists would actually see this as a success.
This would include an international force on the ground.
They must restore public order.
There are probably arguments in favour of both sides.
We cannot accept matters as they stand at present.
The , therefore, is unacceptable.
Furthermore, no type of terrorism is ever justified.
Or justifiable.
Let us clearly state where we want to go.
It is time for the killing to stop.
Mr High Representative,
- Why is Milosevic one thing and Sharon another?
- How far will we go?
- Where is Europe?
- Why is Europe paralysed?
Israel begins pre-emptive strikes on Syrian territory.
This indirect response is not without risk.
Religion must stand for love and shared humanity.
The picture is clear.
We are not historical journalists.
We are politicians.
Now we must decide.
I ask you that.
We are supporting this too.
They put up resistance.
Now, Israel is building a wall of shame.
We know that Israel has weapons of mass destruction.
What are we doing?
What is the EU doing?
We are not doing a lot.
We are not even applying the Association Agreement.
We are not even breaking off trade relations.
A quarter of that period has elapsed.
That is not something I wish to see.
Let us try to prevent such an occurrence.
The gravity of the situation cannot be underestimated.
It is becoming increasingly difficult.
The RoadÂ Map stipulates a short time period.
I believe the aforementioned objective is our shared objective.
Every effort must be made to pre-empt this.
The EuropeanÂ Union will certainly maintain its commitment.
MrÂ Poettering also referred to Iraq.
I should like to follow up on this.
No agreement was reached.
The RoadÂ Map will not implement itself.
This was also discussed at the NewÂ York meeting.
These are essential features of a State.
The necessary effort in this direction has been made.
The FinanceÂ Minister has brought this about.
It featured in the Mitchell report several years ago.
These people are our neighbours.
Their land adjoins ours.
Â Â  .
They simply do not work.
What works is engagement and dialogue.
The Association Agreement with Israel provides for exactly that.
Mr Von Wogau referred to the ring of friends.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrÂ Monti.
Â Â  Thishas been noted,MrÂ Gollnisch.
The debate is closed.
The European Union must table initiatives and practical measures.
(1)
Â Â  Mr President, it is a very simple matter.
I hope that is clear to the House.
Â Â  .
Aid applications such as this are overly complicated.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It understated the extent of the disaster.
The accident was comparable to the disaster.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This would be done principally through an amending budget.
We can do better.
I therefore voted in favour of it.
The results obtained are impressive.
Europe needs to be in space.
Space will always be an engine of industrial innovation.
We therefore voted against the resolution.
The rapporteur wants to go even further.
We also reject this report on these grounds.
This initiative must be fully welcomed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The direct losses come to roughly EUR 500Â 000.
Â Â  Beekeepers keep on sounding the alarm.
Why has this health disaster occurred?
The facts speak for themselves.
This is an important issue.
Â Â  Thank you for that information, MrÂ Wieland.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(1)
One might ask what Latvia expects from Europe.
Your response, colleagues, speaks volumes.
The following changes have been proposed:(1)
(2)
This is not exactly an example of proper governance.
But this is a very specific statement.
These dossiers are still at a standstill.
Â Â  â And so you shall, but not immediately.
It deserves some reflection.
The OSCE believes that electoral fraud took place.
I say this as a friend of Azerbaijan.
Â Â  â I am happy to do that.
Â Â  â The applause speaks for itself.
Fire prevention requires us to keep farming our land.
I agree with the whole of the report.
It could have started as early as 2002.
News of this compromise is welcome.
Responsibility at local level is best.
For all that, is it sufficient?
Protecting and preserving them is essential to our survival.
What is needed is a real prevention policy.
This must be avoided.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Still, we have to look to the future.
It is an inflexible directive based on obsolete data.
Moreover, the committee itself was also somewhat confused.
In short, there is confusion all round.
The provision of information is crucial.
This information must be universally accessible.
We could copy the example of the blue flag.
In addition, blue flags cost money.
I think this is wrong.
What will the Commission do then?
Will we be inundated with infringement proceedings?
Will we be closing beaches?
The first is Amendment No 19 on transitory contamination.
Europe is more than a market and currency.
It is not clear what constitutes a large number.
There are also major discrepancies in Europe.
Who is going to be counting?
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
It is high time that we assumed our responsibilities.
I congratulate Mr Sacconi on his report.
We have some concerns in relation to deadlines.
Ireland was offered 1990 levels, plus 13%.
I welcome the proposal before us here today.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
What, then, is this about?
We are also including railway locomotives in this directive.
The same applies to inland waterway vessels.
That possibility, too, will be excluded.
I thank all those who have helped in this.
That is an approach I strongly support.
Â Â  â Congratulations, Mr Lange.
That is first-rate!
I believe that we are on the right track.
This is something we should constantly bear in mind.
Our approach is without doubt the right one.
We will have to re-examine this.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
We cannot dump this environmental problem on developing countries.
We certainly do not want that.
How was the transaction conducted?
It is high time this changed.
When will they reply?
These are the facts.
We have the capacities.
We have the knowledge.
This is part of the much bigger picture.
Let us wait until we have all the information.
This is part of the existing legislation.
This is what I have asked for.
Is this wise overall?
It is important to say that.
I am responding as the Environment Commissioner.
That seems less dangerous.
As yet we do not have a legal case.
We have asked for more information.
Â Â  â Thank you, CommissionerÂ WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The value of these scholarships is significant.
The third action focuses on teaching staff.
The Commission was proposing EURÂ 200Â million.
We are bringing Europe back onto the international stage.
To be genuinely appealing such a programme requires financing.
Firstly, in respect of the budget.
Some still do not do so.
This is a for anyone from the Netherlands.
It also promotes the understanding of other cultures.
Some fundamental questions remain, however.
EURÂ 230 million alone will certainly not suffice.
The Erasmus Mundus Programme can only be passionately supported.
We will then be clearly lagging behind.
That means we are promoting European values.
I think that we owe it to them.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow from 11.30 a.m.
The second concerns the use of technological resources.
An agreement has now been reached.
A dynamic knowledge economy requires a sound Learning programme.
I should like to make three observations.
Secondly, there is virtual twinning of schools.
E-learning offers new pedagogical models for teaching and learning.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow from 11.30 a.m.
It is therefore a step in the right direction.
Commissioner, I have stressed the timetable.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs Hermange is absolutely right.
It is the children themselves who suffer.
That would not be in the least bit sensible.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow from 11.30 a.m.
(1)
Â Â  We now come to the decision on urgent procedure:
Â Â  Does anybody wish to speak against the urgent procedure?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I did not quite understand.
It was not altogether clear.
Â Â  MrÂ Turmes, could you please clarify this?
We are against.
The aim is more comprehensive than this, however.
We need a single market for engine drivers too.
We need competition throughout the domain of rail transport.
Let me turn now to the Savary report.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski.
That is a very regrettable development.
Railway companies must not focus on themselves.
I think that this is important.
This is not an asocial or antisocial package.
Significantly, it also proposes greater harmonisation.
Rail is a sustainable and safe means of transport.
They need it.
This is progress.
I would like to cite two examples.
They will also increase safety.
Effective change must take account of the human factor.
We happen not to agree on the subject.
Liberalisation at any cost implies certain theoretical assumptions.
Europe needs to learn from experience.
This truly is the primary objective.
The second objective is to respond to public opinion.
Significant political tensions have arisen in such countries.
This second rail package has several dimensions.
Careful preparations will be made.
Safety must always be our objective and our watchword.
Significant progress has been made, nonetheless.
Firstly, there is the establishment of the Agency.
I think we should feel satisfied with this.
I believe this represents a considerable step forward.
Legislation can then be drafted at a later date.
Liberalisation is also an issue.
Indeed, I believe the opposite is the case.
We must not adopt a blinkered approach.
Â Â  .
Nonetheless, we are proceeding to conciliation.
The ultimate beneficiary will be European society.
The rapporteur has just referred to these.
I believe a good balance can be achieved.
We have cooperated in an exemplary manner.
We are of course also eager to do so.
The Council had already drastically shortened the deadlines.
A balance seems to have been reached.
I believe the rapporteur achieved a good balance.
We therefore support his amendments to ArticleÂ 8.
One concerns freight transport and the other passenger transport.
Nonetheless, I am confident of a positive outcome.
The House made this abundantly clear at first reading.
I informed the Council accordingly.
The texts are practically finished.
The last internal discussions are under way.
MrÂ Jarzembowski was quite right to point that out.
That is the logical outcome of the steps taken.
This is not an ideological issue.
It is a fact.
It is one of the advantages of European integration.
Modernisation is sorely needed.
It must remain so.
Some points do remain for conciliation with the Council.
A number of them may prove problematic.
The second rail package could then be finalised.
This represents a considerable challenge.
Accordingly, we stand by our earlier proposals.
We are in agreement on that point.
Which brings me to the second condition.
MrÂ Jarzembowski has produced an excellent piece of work.
I do hope that the Council adopts this.
This would necessitate interconnection of routes.
Rail transport became a core responsibility of the State.
The only question is how it should be done.
An important element is access to the market.
Who receives user rights â and what for?
We agree with most of his proposals, therefore.
Â Â  Mr Sterckx on a point of order.
The same applies to air transport.
I think this is a paradox.
With regard to passengers, I would urge caution.
Yet we still do not have a better service.
That clearly is not the case.
I just want to say that everybody supports safety.
For freight, this is the last opportunity.
I hope we do not throw it away.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
The second principle is this.
Together, they are laying waste to our land.
The third principle is as follows.
These three principles are convergent and interlinked.
Worse, they have serious safety problems.
I need not name them.
That is why this package is so important.
Conventional international trains are being cancelled, for example.
Service is declining in those cases, therefore.
Try explaining that to the electorate.
They then set their sights still higher.
Perhaps we would be afraid of the result.
They take liberalisation too far.
Such liberalisation would particularly affect France.
What will become of life in country areas?
No schedule for passenger rail transport has been established.
This all means that timetables are not kept to.
A trend is emerging in certain railway companies.
It is not what the EuropeanÂ Union wants either.
Traffic has to come off the roads.
TGV is not an option for us.
We are lucky to have even ordinary railway links.
I just do not understand this.
This is a part of our problem.
It is crucial to the rationalisation of European transport.
This variable is essential.
They all need to be involved in the solution.
This must be remedied.
What is actually important is interoperability between them.
That is what we are about.
Liberalisation is the only way to do so.
The time for monopolies is past.
The employees sit tight in their offices.
That is how monopolies operate.
Freight has to be sought out.
It has to be recognised that safety is vital.
Delays could be tolerated in the interests of safety.
The railways need finance.
There are no adequate budget lines for the purpose.
Parliament proposed setting up a European transport fund.
This ultra-liberal position must therefore be rejected.
We should go back to that.
Try telling that to our fishermen and farmers!
These are aspects that need to be addressed.
We urgently need an end to social dumping.
Must liberalisation mean social dumping?
Not in my view.
Does it have to result in job losses?
Again, the answer is no.
And does liberalisation mean less safety?
A number of different approaches were put forward.
That is the first task.
Competition will then come about.
The need for funds was also mentioned.
Turning to the human factor, this is crucial.
It is essential for any form of transport.
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs de Palacio.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  We now continue with the vote.
â That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
European forests cannot be compared with each other.
Â Â  We have voted against the current report.
Â Â  .
Are we really focusing on our forests?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
âPrivate forester-firefightersâ could do this work.
There we have a genuine environmental policy.
Will this remain a dream?
Â Â  .
Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses should be synonymous with quality.
Now, the stakes are high.
The linguistic stakes cannot be ignored.
Â Â  .
That gives us cause for regret.
Â Â  .
We must make our higher education attractive.
Â Â  I was in Paris MrÂ President.
Fantastic!
Â Â  .
- greater intercultural dialogue;
- awareness of languages;
- development of lifelong learning;
- exchanges of good practice.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It goes without saying that I voted in favour.
Â Â  I was on holiday, bathing at the seaside.
This is bureaucratic Europe in all its splendour.
Â Â  .
Portugal is synonymous with a high-quality travel industry.
Tourism has created new recreational activities for holidaymakers.
Â Â  .
What did I see MrÂ President?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Could I vote against it, MrÂ President?
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of this report.
That concludes the explanations of vote.(1)
(2)
Â Â  . â Many thanks, MrÂ President.
I shall come back to that later.
We did this for two reasons.
We want better parliamentary control over these agencies.
Great uncertainty will reign until this has been taken.
We believe that VAT fraud must be further investigated.
The situation in Iraq predominates here.
We shall be voting on this next Thursday.
Parliament takes a different view.
We shall keep a close eye on this.
Â Â  .
Let me give you just one example from Parliament.
It comes from a budget line that is underspent.
Do not get me wrong.
My position on this is quite clear.
Â Â  .
The debate will be conducted in twenty languages.
My second point concerns the new Financial Regulation.
The rapporteur has done a good job.
My group endorses the draft presented today.
I refer to the EUR 1Â million in reserve.
The Commissionâs preliminary draft proposal was inadequate.
It contained two interrelated problems.
I should emphasise that this House is sovereign.
We will make available the staff that enlargement requires.
The biggest problem is with category 4.
They are urging that the Financial Perspective be cancelled.
That we will not do under any circumstances.
Iraq has the potential to be a rich country.
I would like to mention a few of them.
Appropriations for rural development exceed the finance ceiling.
That is why we should abandon this system.
For this I thank him.
On Thursday we are voting on the budget.
All kinds of PPE pipe dreams are involved here.
That you know.
How will we cope afterwards?
Firstly, Iraq.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Then the support for the reconstruction of Iraq.
That is why we shall support that amendment.
We want to see that reserve lifted.
We want to see that reserve lifted.
The third point is not contentious.
This is a very important matter.
I have a couple more individual points to make.
It is permitted to have doubts and worries.
I do not think so.
I do not think that is the way.
'Unilateral trade disarmament' is unacceptable.
There will always be demand for live cattle exports.
Something is clearly wrong!
This leads me to reform.
We have therefore put the 272 posts in reserve.
You also mentioned that this is a first reading.
From Latin America?
From Asia?
From Africa?
From the Mediterranean?
Where are you going to get it from?
The central role of the UN must be strengthened.
Quite the contrary!
I really am slowly coming to wonder about that.
Let me add something political.
Thank you very much!
Our average SME employs five people.
So what has happened to the spirit of Lisbon?
I finish as I started by thanking the rapporteurs.
I believe that fortunately this is not the case.
So much for my first point.
One last comment on the trans-European networks.
Radiation affects 23% of the territory of Belarus.
Rates of sickness have increased dramatically.
In July I visited Belarus.
Not one penny.
That is not good enough.
We have a clear message for the Council.
Action should also be taken to benefit such enterprises.
Finally, we must have proper democratic control.
That is part and parcel of normal debate.
I would like to touch upon the main points.
This I find a good thing.
I share this concern.
This is a recurring theme in many speeches.
There is nothing to prevent this.
That is why I have come to this viewpoint.
Our accounting is consistent.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Another point is the know-how in the EU delegations.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The same applies to their advertising.
This too has been observed in Great Britain.
So they concern very young ages.
Two Commissioners will reply, starting with Mr Byrne.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your answer.
I would like to ask a few supplementary questions.
What steps have you now taken in this regard?
What is the state of play on that point?
Â Â  .
That is currently under legal analysis.
Â Â  .
That is the purpose of this communication.
They constitute consumer fraud and a public health scandal.
Â Â  .
Has the Commission been informed of this practice?
Â Â  .
What can we do if that happens?
Â Â  .
So to that extent the legislation is not circumvented.
But there are issues involved here.
Â Â  .
Tachograph evidence would be used to verify compliance.
This may continue until the animals are dead.
This is completely unnecessary.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am aware of the issues that you raise.
There is no derogation in place at the moment.
So, the issue is under consideration.
Â Â  .
It must also be evidence based.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for that response.
Â Â  .
Other countries too have ruled that it is illegal.
The European Union should do the same.
Â Â  .
I take note of what you have said.
We will move on to questions to Mr Bolkestein.
Â Â  .
At present there is no decision and no agreement.
There is therefore nothing to abrogate.
Most airlines are complying with this.
Â Â  .
Once again, this is not a good situation.
Therefore the legally precarious situation continues to exist.
Once again that is not good.
There is nothing secret about anything at all.
What will happen I do not know.
Having said that I understand Parliament's concerns.
We are working to that end.
I was in Washington last week.
Â Â  .
These are the two solutions.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That is not a question.
The Commissioner has taken note of your opinion.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
At this moment I cannot answer the last question.
That concludes questions to the Commission.
Â Â  .
What else does this Fifth Directive contain?
We must increase the minimum sum.
This compromise does, therefore, actually make sense.
He has also addressed the issue of legal costs.
I have confidence in this.
Insurance law is also complex in this case.
Nobody benefits from legislation that is not enforceable.
It will receive my unqualified support.
Why is it important?
During the debate I had three main requests.
I can, therefore, only welcome this directive.
I think this is a very important benefit.
This is just an important simplification.
Overall this is an excellent piece of work.
Â Â  .
The various speakers have also thanked the Commission.
And so, my thanks to all.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
What could constitute such a system?
Â Â  .
We were a very distinguished vintage.
This own-initiative report raises a wide range of issues.
Such projects must include active participation by local women.
The human rights of women are always relative.
It has in actual fact been admirable.
We are, however, already an economic power.
International indifference on this issue is embarrassing.
Trade rights prevail over womenâs rights.
We should welcome the Commission's initiatives.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The first point: where are we today?
I do not think so.
My intention is also to continue to be transparent.
I hope somebody explained to them why it is ...
No, we cannot.
It also serves to accentuate existing regional inequalities.
Personally, I think that the rules are useful.
It is a rule of good management.
You have stressed this point.
MrsÂ Glase mentioned over-complicated procedures.
I admit that they are complicated.
I think that we can simplify them.
That is my aim.
We have therefore reduced them practically by half.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
There are four proposed amendments to the common position.
This is in the interest of consumer protection.
The third amendment concerns the transposition of the directive.
Our examination of this document went exceptionally well.
These comments should also be observed in future.
They resembled political weather vanes to some extent.
So much for my first comment.
They made our lives very difficult on that score.
My thanks, once again, to the rapporteur.
Health must come first in this case.
Where are the wide criticisms of the SCF opinion?
Have any Member State competent bodies contradicted it?
Has the World Health Organisation contradicted it?
There are safety considerations with the use of aspartame.
That is the right way to tackle this issue.
I hope that is now acceptable to Parliament.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Such a result was only to be expected.
This is very much to be welcomed.
There are examples of how to do it properly.
Such are the two alternatives before it.
I am glad that it has done so.
Â Â  .
Third, the systems are not all fully interoperable.
A lot of money is simply left unclaimed.
What is the timeframe we should be looking at?
This is my first request.
That would make your arguments consistent with each other.
All these countries have been affected by this decision.
We also need a political solution, however.
We have had major problems in the past.
Â Â  â Disposable cans are not environmentally sound.
This is an improvement.
Unfortunately, Mr Lehne stands outside of this consensus.
This deposit system will then become very common.
Â Â  .
This depends on the German Government.
Mrs Breyer asked why I attacked the individual solutionsthe .
She also mentioned Spain and Portugal in this connection.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(1)
This could adversely affect the free circulation of vehicles.
... provided that they observe the law.
I think I have said enough on the matter.
We are in favour of free trade.
I am not calling for subsidies to be abolished.
This is not an option.
This is the type of agreement I believe in.
How we get there is another story.
What does MAP bring to the deal?
MAP also appeals to the African renaissance.
The problem is how to achieve this.
The second parameter consists of the regions.
Malaysia dedicates 35% to these areas.
One of NEPADâs concerns is digital solidarity.
What is involved?
What precisely is involved?
I should like to draw a few brief conclusions.
â¦ without approving of State intervention.
This is an exceptional and unprecedented level of engagement.
We therefore welcome the positive outcome of that mission.
The Council also addressed other developments in world affairs.
Thank you for your attention.
The Growth Initiative is simple and practical.
There are several other important aspects to this Initiative.
Where do we go from here?
That is the difference.
Any reform will be completely impossible.
An inflexible Constitution is worse than nothing.
We are alongside you in doing so.
This is a much more serious issue.
That would make it completely useless.
I believe we should support that decision.
We very much look forward to that.
Nor was there substantive progress on economic reform.
How will societyâs expectations be met?
This proposal concerns peace in the Middle East.
Mr President-in-Office, find a solution to the matter.
That will be worth much more than many words.
The EU state proceeds according to plan.
So does the EU Constitution.
Look at Europe, this Europe!
They are cheapskate proposals.
Well this has not happened.
Here we have enormous scope for making specific proposals.
But this cannot be dealt with separately.
I would like to make one thing absolutely clear.
Why are we concerned?
How should we respond to this tendency?
That is the question.
The issue of the Legislative Council is not insignificant.
The issue cannot and must not be considered closed.
This way of doing things is unacceptable.
Beware of rhetoric!
We must do everything possible to stop this happening.
GuantÃ¡namo and the Baghdad detainees have been mentioned today.
Reality will be your downfall.
This is why we need this constitution.
Let me make a final comment on the Convention.
The United States manage 3%.
This is a tragic waste.
The European Unionâs debt capacity remains intact.
The UN is paralysed by US vetoes.
The Italian Presidency must take action.
Sermonising serves no purpose.
That would really be a democratic Europe.
Would variable geometry not be a more appropriate solution?
Has it been heeded?
Well, opinions may differ about that.
We must give victims the chance to speak out.
Hence, www.stopeuropeanoverregulation.eu!
I am going to refer to three points.
Firstly, the difficult birth of the Constitution.
Is there any proportion between costs and outcome?
To promote that research is to reduce suffering.
Commitments rather than words.
All of these are things we can agree with.
To that question you would not give an answer.
The Brussels proposals are tangible and interesting.
We do not need anything new.
We all know what points remain to be resolved.
Delays will do nothing to resolve these issues.
I will conclude by putting a question to you.
We had anticipated this all along.
We must continue to call a spade a spade.
My second comment has to do with repatriation policy.
The occupation has also robbed us of freedom.â
Carry on!
We shall abide by the draft Constitutional Treaty.
I really would ask you to reflect on this.
The third issue: the quality of investments.
Together we have to do this.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mr Rothley is a remarkable kind of Social Democrat.
That is why I reject this proposal.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
I find that odd, in fact downright absurd.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This proposal is an interesting step in that direction.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  We welcome more efficient administration of the Structural Funds.
Â Â  .
The amendments are:
Â Â  .
Hence my vote in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
(2)
Things used not to be as bad as that.
Thank you very much.
The fourth and final area is that of resources.
I remain committed to supporting you on this.
Â Â  .
Engagement does not mean abandoning principle.
We have strong views about terrorism.
We have strong views about nuclear weapons.
Reference has been made to Iran.
I would like to highlight two examples.
Why not analyse these experiences and apply them generally?
The Council has ignored this recommendation for ten presidencies.
Well, ladies and gentlemen ...
This piling on of responsibilities will cause ....
It should therefore remain under national parliamentary scrutiny.
Multilateralism also involves maintaining transatlantic relations.
This is particularly the case as regards Tibet.
All the best!
Will this institution do its job?
Will it enjoy effective powers?
I certainly hope so.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11Â a.m.
This process seems contradictory at times.
It is an important development.
Â Â  .
The presidency has referred to two examples.
The Commission has followed recent developments in Chechnya.
Let us be clear.
We have also had a taste of Russian isolation.
Finally, my greetings go to the Russian Government.
The issues involved are much worse, though.
They were a sham, a farce.
Another example is the Basque Country.
Political solutions have to be sought.
No one else can solve the conflict for them.
It is not possible for Moscow to dictate solutions.
We must not, therefore, forget Chechnya.
The EU will shortly be importing Russian uranium.
Plans are afoot to synchronise the two electricity grids.
But what do the Russia-bashers want?
First we must see law and order restored.
Only then can true democracy prevail.
Only Russia can deliver that.
I hope that this can be resolved amicably.
Russia is suffering from terrorism and from organised crime.
We must not blot out unpleasant issues.
What, then, should we be calling for?
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
There are also more strictly political considerations.
These are the questions that have been asked.
We have weighed up the pros and cons.
Â Â  .
This resolution contains some significant new features.
In the end, the text was withdrawn.
That was the situation in 1999.
This would lead to further divisive debate.
So discussion of this amounts to something almost perverse.
The risk of defeat?
Commissioner, Minister, you know all this.
China is the worst of them all.
Might the American people be less humane than ourselves?
I doubt it.
You must not hesitate in this area, gentlemen.
The responsibility lies with yourselves, Minister and Commissioner.
The death penalty must be abolished.
It is not negotiable.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
The debate is closed.
I have just two specific supplementary questions.
That is my first question.
It includes a few officials.
Can it send the relevant documents to Parliament?
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
The aid organisations are very worried.
Opponents receive nothing.
This common position was extended until 20 February 2004.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
The situation is therefore getting worse all the time.
We have been warning of this for some time.
Do you take a positive view of this development?
I think that they were very clear.
This is the first sign.
The financial package is now on the table.
When will the legal bases actually be created?
Is the Council aware of this situation?
Is the Council aware of this situation?
The Council has not discussed the conditions of trial.
This is how things stand.
This is the state of affairs.
Â Â  My colleague MrÂ Alyssandrakis has raised the issue.
The prisoners are allowed no contact with their families.
That concludes Question Time to the Council
Â Â  .
Well, it is time for work.
The report deals with various burning issues.
Â Â  .
And that commitment seems to be lacking.
Israel really must address these widely expressed concerns.
The report addressed the Commission directly on several issues.
Let me briefly go through them.
Paragraph 31 refers to future elections in Palestine.
Paragraph 40 speaks about schoolbooks.
The Commission is not directly involved in this issue.
We must all work to that end.
Yes, we have now become more demanding.
His suggestions and recommendations are entirely to the point.
We are all familiar with the obstacles to peace.
We must intervene very much more forcefully.
Why does Commissioner Liikanen not address this issue?
That is why we must intervene.
They want protection, and they need protection.
Let us protect the Palestinians.
Why are you overlooking his Israeli counterpart?
This is the respectable culture that is represented here.
Unrealistic expectations are still being kept alive.
There are United Nations resolutions that are not enforced.
This is something of great importance.
There is an extremely serious problem: the wall.
The number of people living in poverty has tripled.
We must offer them our utmost solidarity.
The EU must now strongly support the Geneva Agreement.
Both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples want peace.
However, the signs are not very encouraging.
The mutual violence defies all imagination.
Discussion of this in Israel is gathering pace.
I think the comparison is absolutely outrageous.
Personally, it makes me want to throw up.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
It is to be welcomed.
There is some logic in this.
But we have to agree what competitiveness means.
The Council has already made its views known.
Parliament will do so through this report.
The Commission has sketched out a sectoral analysis.
Â Â  .
Manufacturing drives the growth of the service sector.
The screening process is well under way.
The Commission will make a communication on that basis.
That report will be ready in January.
We will do that early next year.
We must make this a permanent approach towards industry.
Why do so few make an effort themselves?
The role of the Member States is fundamental.
Â Â  .
I can only say, it was about time.
Our compatriots are worried.
A second obstacle is fiscal and social differences.
Perhaps we talk about it too optimistically.
Those factors are quite different from objective costs.
The entrepreneur has invested capital.
But why is it that entrepreneurship is important?
How are we to achieve this?
We must make it a social choice.
I will end with a word about method.
Another thing we need is social cohesion.
Finally, world trade policy.
There are essential questions that cannot be avoided here.
Finally, I will mention policy on lifelong learning.
Let us be forgiving of honest failure.
I know many of them.
We also need support for European networking.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
These aims are:
I applaud this proposal.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
I am suggesting, however, a few amendments.
Â Â  .
I agree in particular with three important major amendments.
The committee made this very clear once again.
We would like to make a clear distinction.
The most important of these concerns penalties.
I have carried my donor card for many years.
I actively support the NHS organ donor campaign.
Moreover, not every donor is suitable.
As a result, many donors do not qualify.
My country should take this to heart.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
What type of representation do we have?
Did the Commission not know what was happening?
What kind of information was there?
Bolivia is the poorest country in South America.
Millions of country people are living in misery.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Zero catches means no fishing in the North Sea.
The Commission is not alone in this objective.
This evidence should involve fishermen as well as scientists.
Successful recovery of the stock must be the priority.
That is very serious.
Any further cuts will be fatal.
I do not intend to attack the scientists.
The fishermen said this was rubbish.
So who is right?
Secondly, it calls for certain reports.
The socio-economic problems have arisen from an ecological problem.
This is the fourth attempt.
But it is not all good.
We can no longer ignore ICES.
Mrs Stihler has mentioned the situation in Canada.
There is still time for this to be done.
The question is how.
Nevertheless, the plan also has the inevitable drawbacks.
The same goes for sport fishing.
There is no proposal to do this.
I suppose it is a start, though.
Time has proved us to be right.
Has what we have done to date achieved anything?
I believe we need a more regional approach.
The status quo is no longer an option.
There will be other opportunities to do that.
None of them have availed themselves of this facility.
I am obliged to reject Amendment No 14.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
Secondly, I have a technical correction to announce.
(1)
I also want to propose three oral amendments.
The following remarks are added.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote on the budget.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
(2)
(3)
This would enable us to hold a joint vote.
(4)
That concludes the votes.(5)
Â Â  .
We have voted against this measure.
Foreign policy must remain under the sovereignty of nations.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
All of this reduces budgetary transparency.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Mr President, I am concerned.
We have allowed election dates to influence our votes.
Â Â  .
It has made no provision for international passenger services.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is why I voted for this report.
Â Â  .
Hence my vote in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Again democratic rights are in their line of fire.
Other opponents had better reasons.
Â Â  .
The recent Brussels summit concentrated on economic issues.
This mugging of democracy has to stop.
That is quite nonsensical.
Â Â  The report is good in many respects.
Â Â  .
They come as no surprise:
Â Â  .
The proposed multilateralism remains, therefore, a facade.
Our own vision is the opposite.
We have voted against this report.
A united front with the USA is desirable.
I thank MrÂ Brok for his clarity.
Â Â  .
For these reasons, I abstained.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The bottom line is simply this.
Â Â  .
This objective, however, is not wholly realised.
Â Â  .
We abstained on two technical points only.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I abstained from voting in the final vote.
That is to miss the point.
The report follows in the same direction.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I feel that that is clear in â¦
Would the textile industry disappear from Western Europe?
Its shareholders have lost nothing, however.
Â Â  .
Is it, however, enough to say that?
This report does not respond to this urgent need.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of this important report.
This led to my voting against paragraph 1d.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
(6)
We believe this to be a particularly important point.
Â Â  .
However, today they are notoriously inadequate.
The efforts of fishermen are indispensable in this regard.
For example, take what happened last week.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The second measure involves the systems to limit catches.
They have lasted for 20 years altogether.
Some fleets required no reductions at all.
Now the MAGPs themselves are being scrapped.
This is going to cause a major socio-economic crisis.
It is looming on the horizon.
They were simply decommissioned.
There is a major problem with rewarding the law-breakers.
In the case of the that vessel was illegal.
What did the Commission do?
It helped make it legal.
It has made an illegal situation legal.
It has done the same with the Dutch.
It has now legalised an illegal situation.
That is the wrong signal to send out.
That should also be investigated.
I digress.
In addition, we must not stand still.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It has therefore proposed partial decoupling of aid.
I am particularly anxious about tobacco-producing areas.
It therefore has the force of a treaty.
Furthermore, this is an unprecedented decision.
Â Â  .
I refer to MrÂ Alemanno, the Italian Minister.
The Spanish Agriculture Minister is of the same opinion.
Some 20Â 000 families would be affected.
Allow me to make some summary comments.
Parliament rejected AmendmentsÂ NosÂ 723Â andÂ 338.
I know the CommissionerÂ forÂ Agriculture has feelings.
I am bound make an initial observation.
MrÂ JoveÂ Peres highlighted this earlier.
A decision will then be taken in plenary.
Changes are in train within the common agricultural policy.
The result will be large-scale rural exodus.
I therefore urge the Commission to be flexible.
Impact assessments are needed too.
It does not grant any export refunds whatsoever.
Imports are totally free.
They are not subject to tariffs of any kind.
The chronicle of a death announced before Gothenburg.
These proposals are not open to amendment or improvement.
So far, my efforts have been in vain.
I believe the Commission does actually know this.
Incidentally, these measures are not additional, Commissioner.
They come from the producers themselves.
In any case, they will be insufficient.
They find themselves in an unbearable situation.
We will discuss these proposals after the legislative proposal.
Â Â  .
I will begin with tobacco.
A clear option is being taken.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The war amounted to a confrontation between ethnic groups.
Sadly, it resulted in almost 300Â 000 deaths.
A peace process is currently under way.
The programme also aimed to facilitate justice and reconciliation.
Additional funds will be allocated under the ninth EDF.
Â Â  .
What have we done so far?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Just compare that with our resolution.
Council and Commission, please, understand your calling.
President Niyazov renamed himself.
He renamed the days of the week.
From 1985 he has ruled as a tyrant.
Since 1999 he has been president for life.
I trust that the Commission will do just that.
He should never have been charged.
It summoned him home for treatment.
Does that mean that Europe should ignore Central Asia?
The first is the strategic goals.
Ignoring that region will not do.
I should like to begin with Turkmenistan.
There is every reason for this.
We must stand up for freedom of belief.
That leaves Kyrgyzstan.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
We now have a delegation there.
Â Â  .
We would be very grateful for that.
The joint debate is closed.(1)
Â Â  The next item is the vote.(1)
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That reduction has taken place in practice, however.
Â Â  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 5.10 p.m.)
They are very welcome.
The following changes have been proposed:
Is he proposing to amend the current scheme?
Surely he is not concerned about the cost!
She declined to do so.
Thank you.
Any majority would be quite fortuitous.
I shall not follow that suggestion.
Why did you take only the two largest groups?
I believe that this threatens the peace process.
Parliament ought to be recalled back in Colombo.
Our direct intervention is needed.
There was a serious ecological disaster.
A great deal of oil leaked into the port.
I should like you to intervene.
We have a hostage here.
We need to intervene in this matter.
That concludes the item.
Thank you very much.
They are very welcome.
Â Â  .
The reason is clear.
Next year will be decisive for Turkey.
We continue to hope this will happen.
We did not even give it a second look.
I regard the overall outcome as very balanced.
I can keep this relatively brief.
Both Bulgaria and Romania have made remarkable progress.
It is a statement of fact.
Â Â  I thank the Commission for those reports.
You mentioned the material that has been published.
Now for my second question.
My third point has to do with Turkey.
I knew that this would happen.
Where, then, if not in this House?
Where if not among the people of Europe?
I am in full agreement with that.
I welcome what the Commission has said today.
How exactly are the EEA negotiations progressing?
The results were very interesting.
I welcomed the Commissioner's remarks on Turkey.
I would like an answer.
Â Â  The Commissioner will answer that in his next reply.
My sincere congratulations on this.
This is an important point.
So am I, to say the least.
These are matters with major implications.
The military have lost nothing there.
There is no question about that.
The political conditions governing accession have been met.
I have three questions.
My third point is that we want good partnerships.
That is the current situation.
The possibilities of influencing it are extremely limited.
I know that you yourself have already done this.
Would it be fair to say that?
I am not aware of this having happened.
This is especially true for the area of agriculture.
Thank you.
We need Turkey on our side.
The public also needs to be told this.
I ask for your understanding.
That concludes the item.
It is not too early.
We owe it to our citizens.
Failure would make losers of us all.
I will give you just two examples.
Firstly, qualified majority voting.
All the cards are on the table.
All the positions are known.
The Maastricht Conference revealed a shared goal.
The Amsterdam Conference produced a useful but incomplete result.
Speaking of a conquered people, Cicero said â.
It will be a red line for us.
They are imposing treasury autocracy upon parliamentary democracy.
The autocrats will have won out over the democrats.
What you read isÂ âÂ I findÂ âÂ unbelievable.
The citizens?
They are the sole legislators.
That is understandable, that is legitimate.
Another step forward: Euratom.
I could go on.
The attacks are fierce.
This is not the way!
That is the way.
Nice is the Treaty in force.
We believe that the European Union cannot fail.
The European Union must not fail.
There is no glossary.
Is it Estoniaâs fault?
Polandâs?
The Intergovernmental Conference is in reverse gear.
We are back in Nice again!
That is why Parliament must keep its budgetary powers.
That is technically possible.
Frankly, that is unacceptable.
That is what we should aim for.
The people do not need a European constitution.
They hardly even need a European Union.
That is definitely unacceptable.
Â Â  .
Whether it is right is a different issue.
To take such action would neuter this Parliament.
Secondly, allow me to mention three concrete problems.
And there is something else we must not allow.
The IGC has reached the limits of its powers.
Law making will be weakened as a result.
That is all a change in the substance.
The Convention created a good atmosphere.
I therefore say âLong live the Constitutionâ!
We have undertaken to return to this matter too.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
I should now like to focus on content.
They are the water carriers.
Another important point is participation.
A fund must have well-defined objectives.
A solidarity fund is not appropriate here.
Well, they are in Asia.
And there are 800 million of them.
Why are we even considering this?
Â Â  .
This has already been done for other regions.
Why a simple regulation?
That is the policy which Parliament has enthusiastically endorsed.
Why a single regulation?
I could not agree more.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate:
But it is not our fault.
We like to work carefully.
And it can be checked by the courts.
We will vote in favour of it.
We are against degressivity.
We will therefore also vote accordingly.
Now I do not know what to say.
Â Â  .
At the moment it is far too complicated.
I share the rapporteur's view about transparency.
What are those realities?
That new financial regulation has consequences.
That is the problem.
Therefore we had to find a solution.
It chose the difficult way.
There are dozens of them, Mr President.
Why did Parliament not receive the proposal until May?
What remains to be done now, then?
The new financial regulation makes no provision for earmarking.
Parliament now has to vote on the amendments.
Â Â  Mr President, the risk is clear.
That much is very clear.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Their names deserve to be mentioned.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Europe of rights and freedoms demands it.
I would therefore urge you to reconsider our amendment.
I find this really regrettable and also incomprehensible.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The agencies will have no controllers.
That is something we approved unanimously in the committee.
Â Â  .
Parliament should be involved in this appointment procedure.
I think the Commission should look at this.
I thank the rapporteur for all his work.
There are more and more of them.
That is an offence against Europeâs taxpayers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, just a brief comment.
It is disappointing.
Really disappointing.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
This report is about the internal market.
The other issue in this report is environmental.
Those are my two recommendations in this report.
Â Â  .
That seems to be working.
Reforming the group exemption regulation has not helped.
I therefore support Mrs Honeyballâs report.
This is how the internal market works in Europe.
I disagree on the question of safety.
That is quite clear.
Matters cannot continue like this.
That is something we ourselves have acknowledged.
A premium must be placed upon environmental considerations.
These are important points of view.
I therefore support Mrs Honeyball's report.
What is all the fuss about?!'
I say this is a fundamental constitutional principle.
Has Mrs Honeyball consulted Mr Brown, I wonder?
But that is a detail for another day.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  (1).
The volume of financial investment is currently growing rapidly.
Our aim is to complete land reform next year.
We are a country of rapidly developing advanced technologies.
Investment in infrastructure is of special importance here.
It is also about a spirit of compromise.
It is necessary to find a balance.
We must respect each other's culture and identity.
I can subscribe to these words today.
He wrote that 'Europe is searching for itself.
Secondly, new technological developments need support and staff.
For the latter is beyond our powers!
Thirdly, large-scale reorganisations have a social dimension.
It must be evaluated as an absolute measure.
Companies require from the government a stable business climate.
We could list a whole host of things.
For what was the case at Renault?
That was the big problem.
No, it is the Belgian Government.
The social partners should definitely be involved as well.
I have another two specific questions.
The current programming periods are still running.
Finally, I should like to say the following.
Â Â  .
Now it is time for measures!
The same applies to the working time directive.
That is our first question.
These are not easy subjects for the accession countries.
There are numerous social directives.
We are encouraging the development of social dialogue.
Including here.
Our second priority is employment.
I agree with that.
We have already had an extensive debate on this.
There are a range of issues outstanding.
That is vitally important.
Finally, a word of warning.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Who determines the laws?
Who personifies public power?
The answer is, none.
Is it a case of our constituting a minority?
We constitute at least half the population.
No, that is not the reason, either.
Unfortunately, matters do not look too good.
Personally, I believe it is the classic situation.
None of us are saints.
Among the new countries, matters appear lopsided.
I am able to concur with it 100%.
That is something we must change.
It will then be updated each year.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m said that men elect men.
This is completely contrary to the trend.
We also know this from job applications.
When women apply, qualifications have to be added.
At last these matters are being talked about.
In these conditions women have done well.
Why is the EU not interesting?
The Commission must accept its responsibility.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.(1)
I extend a warm welcome to the Chinese delegation.
Â Â  We now continue with the vote.
Â Â  .
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
This is something that we reject.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This development contributes to greater equality between people.
Unfortunately, this is not happening simultaneously throughout Europe.
We must eliminate the obstacles to this.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is what democracy is all about.
One regulation with two chapters.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The purpose of EU aid is to fight poverty.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against the report.
Â Â  .
I have therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I welcome in particular:
Â Â  .
Can anyone take this seriously?
Â Â  .
A chance we cannot afford to miss!
Â Â  .
We do not feel at home with this method.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Council has still not delivered an opinion.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.(1)
Â Â  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
The following changes have been proposed:
It is what happens in normal practice.
I therefore think we must say no.
(1)
The supply of Cardhu single malt has run low.
We should insist that they themselves play the game.
I believe we must concern ourselves with their plight.
I look forward to your reactions, Mr President.
We cannot accept such things in a European Union.
In all events, the ship was insured.
The universities and schools are closed to Russian.
This is extremely odd.
What is the reason for that?
It is very obvious.
Â Â  .
There are three basic objectives:
The communication introduces a multiannual, rolling action plan.
You mentioned transport.
Regrettably, this did not happen.
This should really happen in the near future.
What do we see?
Can a year really make any difference?
Such was not the case with this one.
The problem of people with disabilities is deeply class-based.
Demands have been made in a number of areas.
Now, it is a question of implementing them.
I share that view.
Disability policy is not a policy area.
That applies to everyone, including people with disabilities.
The first is the new Member States.
The second is the debate about the future.
She was a trainee at the SHARE community.
They bring the courage.
They deserve from us the opportunity and the dignity.
People with disabilities are still discriminated against.
It is not a matter of isolated cases.
Â Â  .
I shall explain what I mean at once.
And I have explained the reasons.
They were not easy, I can assure you.
They passed the required majority of 12 votes.
Yet the directives got through in record time.
We are not talking about application.
We are talking about adopting the legislation.
So that is the situation today.
I have spoken about legislation.
It is not a question of courage here.
I really cannot accept that statement.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
That ends the debate on the Commission statement.
Emotions have run high in recent weeks.
Amendments 7, 17 and 18 clarify this.
I appeal to colleagues to think again.
One or two amendments need to be addressed.
Please vote for common sense tomorrow and on Wednesday.
Our position is therefore unambiguous.
He lost.
Todayâs vote blazes a trail.
That time is now.
That is the crucial question.
That is what this is really about.
What is wrong with this logic?
I am in favour of stem cell research.
There are therefore alternatives to destroying human embryos.
I would quote Amendment 61 to illustrate my point.
Why, however?
Indeed, you do not give the scientific grounds.
This has nothing to do with science.
I am sure that goal is desired by everyone.
What is the purpose of a cut-off date?
Now to the matter of dates.
I have a direct question for the Commissioner.
It was a very long way from the truth.
It is not justified on ethical grounds.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, yes!
Yes to research.
There are two aspects to this.
A few final words on stem cell research.
Why the dates?
What matters to us â if this fallback position â¦
That and that alone is the issue at stake.
Talk of life and death distort reality.
I am against artificial deadlines.
Loyalty to beliefs and to their origins is their .
We cannot accept such a blatant strategy.
I support their protests.
Under what conditions?
Most of us are not scientific experts.
Abortion is carried out quite legally.
Let me say something to Mr Cappato.
You were already unique.
And Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m, you have a little baby!
Very positive results have already been achieved.
There has certainly been no debate in DÃ¡il Ãireann.
There is a public outcry in Ireland.
A lot has happened since 2002.
That is significantly fewer.
Amendment 11 removes a condition from the Commission proposal.
Today there are more of them in existence.
I cannot be clearer than that.
They are also being imported into Germany.
That is consistent.
I understand that there are differences of opinion.
That is a sign of Europeâs greatness.
But there is also a value: research.
We are nowhere near doing that.
Enterprises are moving their research to the USA.
What is to be done?
Secondly, we have to increase public expenditure.
There is no time to lose.
A smaller investment will not bring the same benefit.
Statistical illusion also has a part in this.
We have much to learn from them.
Congratulations again to Mr Linkohr and to Mr Busquin.
For that I should like to thank our rapporteur.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
I therefore ask you to adopt this amendment.
Â Â  .
The Commission can accept Amendments 1 to 5.
We will pursue these proceedings vigorously.
Â Â  .
The IDA programme is more complicated.
The new programme will be called IDABC.
I will not go into the detail.
Â Â  .
That really is not good enough.
Â Â  .
Competitiveness is absolutely crucial to the current agenda.
I strongly support their flexibility.
The word 'interoperability' is appearing increasingly frequently.
Congratulations again to both rapporteurs.
Is there really universal access?
We do not know.
There again, there is no opinion.
This is provided for until 2005.
We therefore support these projects.
What is the reason for this?
We are particularly advocating a competitive and open market.
Why do we do this?
What exactly is it proposing to do?
The Commission needs to be tougher.
This position is unacceptable.
We must keep to what we have decided.
That is only fair for everyone.
That is European innovation.
Â Â  .
I have a few comments.
Mr Herzog made a very interesting comment.
Regulation is not the purpose here.
The infringement procedure has three phases.
We are waiting for the reply.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  .
My criticism mainly concerns the following matters.
Diesel fuel tax is one such area.
It creates an imbalance in competition between companies.
So how do things now stand with the outcome?
That is precisely what this is about.
I therefore find this proposal very worrying.
I would appreciate a concrete response.
Â Â  .
Indeed they have spoken about fiscal 'sovereignty'.
Let me give you some figures.
Then there is Luxembourg.
Now why should that be the case?
There will also be a reduction in CO2 emissions.
I am not so pessimistic.
It is certainly not the case.
Once again, this is not something I expect.
It is beneficial to the environment.
They are entitled to fill up their tanks there.
Â Â  .
But you cannot explain.
It is an open-and-shut case.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
(1)
(1)
Private-sector involvement will vary from project to project.
What are the stages of this Initiative of ours?
All these reforms have been introduced gradually.
I described these measures to Cocobu earlier today.
That is also as we intended.
This has proved damaging in the Eurostat case.
That is still my objective.
The Commission is taking this into account.
Secondly, allowing OLAF to concentrate on its priorities.
That also needs to be said, ...
... but that is not my main point.
As a democrat, kindly let me express mine.
Thankfully, you have now clarified your position.
We are trying to be objective.
It is essential to speak the truth.
You hold the highest office in the European Union.
The latter represent the Sephardi community in Turkey.
The word Sepharad means Spain in Hebrew.
I said more besides.
He must therefore fulfil his responsibilities.
He made unacceptable pronouncements concerning Chechnya and Russia.
You all have the power to rectify the situation.
No doubt we shall find out then.
We all are.
He stated the outlook was set fair.
This is a crucially important request.
There is certainly one in Spanish.
What is required is the option of specific monitoring.
It is not a contentious issue amongst ourselves.
There is still very significant room for improvement.
Is anyone taking responsibility, however?
No, apparently not.
The Santer Commission fell just under five years ago.
We want to see results.
That is just not enough, however.
The culture must be changed.
Irregularities and fraud have consequences.
Fine words, but patently of no consequence.
President Prodi, that is not good enough!
There are some points missing from your legislative programme.
Lastly, the question of Eurostat.
The western world must stand united in combating terrorism.
The Commission still has to devise all these arrangements.
No, MrÂ Prodi, you have not.
You bear full responsibility.
Who bears political responsibility for the Eurostat scandal?
Where are those 18 missing contracts?
Who is responsible for their not being there?
Who will obtain them?
They were quickly and resolutely frozen out.
Who has responsibility for restoring their civil rights?
Step down.
The Europe of reform, President Prodi?
Such is the state of the Union.
The European Parliament cannot afford to lose a year.
Our fellow citizens would not understand.
We will ensure that it does so!
Our negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania must continue too.
We need a swift decision here.
We must consider the social consequences.
Surely that is a catastrophe?
I would like to make two further comments.
The first concerns foreign policy.
Mr Prodi, you have heard our views today.
There are too many questions, as I said.
What about the less serious incidents?
When did they occur?
Are they still going on?
The size of the sum taken, maybe?
What are we to infer from this?
As if things were not bad enough already!
That is one lesson the Commission should learn.
Let me now turn to some individual points.
That is necessary.
Let me comment on the issue of political responsibility.
That was how we analysed the situation in July.
That is wrong.
That is a very honourable position in my view.
I would like us to ...
Finally, this programme leaves many questions unanswered.
Such a Parliament needs to be a functioning entity.
It must not adopt an arrogant stance either.
Many have good cause to be grateful to her.
Actions speak louder than words.
We need results in 2004.
We are not involved.
Further reform is needed.
That is the positive message we must convey.
Nevertheless, there is certainly still room for improvement.
The objective remains unfixed.
This is the list awaiting decision by the legislator.
True, this is a problem for the Council.
The programme is good, consistent and global.
Sadly, that tragedy was repeated in Spain.
These measures are doomed to failure.
I am not making an ideological statement.
You can count on our support over this.
As I said, this is curious.
What planet is he on?
Is this anything more than empty words?
There are also the legislative controls.
Administrative controls have their place within administration.
I refer to the adoption of the interinstitutional agreement.
If that has changed I welcome it.
Why do I welcome it?
We look to the Commission to address that issue.
How can it do this?
Education must be a priority for enlargement.
Topics should be interlinked.
There are a few more countries waiting to join.
What is the Council's position on that?
The report will be tabled in this House shortly.
That must change.
Directorates-General can currently exist outside the scrutiny of auditors.
That must change too.
Eurostat is a case in point.
We must act now.
For that you have our entire support.
The objectives are more relevant than ever.
To do that would make for enough coordination!
The Commission has been a kangaroo court.
The Eurostat affair does nothing to further that cause.
I shall endeavour to be brief.
Further, this plan does not concern Eurostat alone.
It applies generally to the functioning of the Commission.
MrÂ President, I believe the sequence is wrong.
It should be reversed.
After all, information does not generate responsibility.
None of them resulted in significant achievements.
We must establish it as such.
This is much more serious than any other issue.
I was asked another question on cohesion policy.
This will be decided by OLAF.
This comment, though, hung in the air.
This is a curious body with two souls.
He cannot be denied that right.
Preventive censure must not be introduced.
It simply does not make sense.
I think that is pretty basic.
That is what I actually stated.
You woke up to this five months later.
That is your problem.
Clearly, these points of view diverge.
That concludes the item.
Â Â  â The next item is the vote.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am at a loss.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â Mrs Kauppi, I fully understand that point.
That amendment has now disappeared.
I want to know where it is.
It is someone else's problem.
Â Â  .
â That concludes the vote.
I wish to highlight four essential points:
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
This position is unacceptable.
I cannot but vote against it.
Â Â  â That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Patakis.
That is not correct.
Â Â  The necessary correction will be made, Mr Korakas.
Clearly, no country or sector is risk-free.
The maritime sector is no exception.
Admittedly, that was back in 1985.
Priority should be given to passenger transport.
This will ensure MemberÂ States meet their international commitments.
It is important to bear this in mind.
I also appreciate their support for this report.
I refer to MrÂ OrejaÂ Arburua and MrÂ Folias.
I have in mind the and especially the .
The RETTÂ Committee endorses this approach.
The Vice-President of the Commission referred to this earlier.
One of these was mentioned earlier.
It should cover all the workers concerned.
The EuropeanÂ Parliament has done good work.
It responds to the citizensâ concerns.
This is no mere formality.
They are all liable to become soft targets.
Â Â  .
It would therefore be worth coordinating them better.
Otherwise, it is sterile and ineffective.
The IMO conventions are not in any way binding.
To wait and see is not an option.
Why is Europe aiming so high?
The internal maritime borders should therefore be lifted.
Such measures should not apply only to passenger vessels.
Nonetheless, are there no concerns?
Are there no questions?
There are.
Security is an important issue in shipping.
We have adopted measures in this Parliament.
Furthermore, cooperation with Russia is particularly important.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
One can see a certain logic in this.
Please permit me to make the following final observation.
Far from it.
Things can evidently go the other way.
Not everyone is pleased with it.
I should like to touch upon those demonstrations.
This is very unfortunate.
More room means growth and employment.
Pledges of that kind should also be possible elsewhere.
This proposal should be rejected on Thursday.
Enough has been said about pilotage.
However, it is not too late.
Indeed, the major problem lies with self-handling.
These people have arguments we have to listen to.
You spoke about coherence.
This exchange is anything but fair.
This is the twenty-first century.
We want a modern and effective social Europe.
That is the Europe I believe in.
Perhaps some people want that.
Perhaps that is what some people want to maintain.
Surely that was not the intention of this liberalisation.
This was conceded in the conciliation procedure.
It has thus become a bad example of liberalisation.
This text is bad news for pilots, too.
On the contrary, we want more compulsory pilotage.
There have also been more thanÂ 60 near collisions.
What about compensation payments and adjustments?
Let me remind you of Article 12.
What training opportunities do they have?
Pilotage services have an essential safety function.
Hence our vote against this proposal.
The word was âmustâ.
I shall therefore be voting against the draft.
We reject this directive.
We are opposed to it.
The intention has already been erased.
We are not going from paradise to purgatory.
There is no way around this.
The shipowners are not demanding a different system.
The reverse is true.
They are accustomed to proceeding via social dialogue.
We should have gone in the opposite direction.
This has not turned out to be the case.
There are currently companies which resolve certain issues themselves.
And that is what we are proposing.
Air traffic is equivalent to maritime traffic.
Let us make comparisons which make sense.
What is so worrying in Belgium?
They are not going to have to change it.
They may have to make some modifications.
It is true: they will be able to.
That is another matter, ladies and gentlemen.
I would have no objection.
It is not.
We will take questions to the Commission.
What about flags other than European flags?
Water, as you know, is life.
Â Â  â Thank you very much for your answer.
That is not how we should arrange matters.
That is not something of which I approve.
The Commission intends to fully make good its commitment.
Subject: Reconstruction of Iraq
I have two brief supplementary questions.
How does he see those conflicts being resolved?
That is what describes the situation.
Â Â  There is another solution.
Would the Commissioner be prepared to do that?
This must be followed up in a careful manner.
That goes back six years and nothing has changed.
One is that we spoke about a technical analysis.
We would also like the Commission to support this.
The debt is grossly unfair.
These countries are being exploited under false pretences.
Â Â  . â I tried to explain this.
What Ireland is doing is fine.
That is not so easy to do in practice.
I keep returning to this in my discussions.
Â Â  â I agree with you.
You cannot move onto the third part.
It is the precedent which is always applied.
Furthermore, the Commissioner is replacing MrÂ Patten.
That is why he is speaking for longer.
Generally, the Commission funds clearly-described projects and programmes.
Â Â  . â There is a big misunderstanding here.
Abortion has to do with a woman's situation.
There is a human rights element to this choice.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
Â Â  â This is not a question, Commissioner.
I imagine that you take note of this statement.
I find it a discourtesy to colleagues.
But it is not a lack of courtesy.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
We all know that.
The figures speak for themselves.
One in four people in Europe dies of cancer.
We must also keep innovating.
One in four Europeans will die of cancer.
However, screening cannot be seen in isolation.
Public education and information are essential.
What we have before us today is a recommendation.
I and my colleagues very much welcome his report.
There are so many questions about cancer.
Concerning breast cancer, screening is well advanced.
Now we need the HPV alongside it.
Lung cancer is the most deadly.
We need more PET scanners.
We only have five in the United Kingdom.
We need to highlight these disparities.
We need the cancer networks.
Screening means diagnosis.
Diagnosis means lives saved.
We can change fear into productive awareness and care.
It is important to have this debate.
A further amendment was tabled for the plenary session.
Finally, Amendment 33 cannot be accepted.
Â Â  â Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The actual model proposed by the Agency is innovative.
This sort of thing has to be tackled.
Now that will not be enough either.
With broadband we are on line the whole time.
The human factor is also a risk.
Information security thus affects everyone everywhere.
Without security the Lisbon objectives will not be implemented.
Three types of measure are in progress.
International cooperation will be indispensable.
Voting rules are slightly problematic.
I welcome that.
Guarantee long-term transparency in the application procedure.
The importance of the Agency is clear.
The Commissioner has just pointed it out.
What was it about?
So this is where we have got to.
I challenge you to provide that transparency.
I believe we have achieved a good compromise.
A start has been made, however.
We must then also fill in the specific details.
Efficiency â what efficiency?
Speed is of the essence.
Firstly, the issue of differing security standards.
None of the other amendments can be accepted.
Would you allow the Italian presidency to answer it?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Clear criteria for recovery must therefore be developed.
Clarity is needed in the shorter term.
A misunderstanding persists as to these grounds for refusal.
My final point concerns the implementation of this Regulation.
We still have a huge waste problem in Ireland.
There is a lack of clear criteria.
The European Commission has blundered here.
We must now hold this political debate.
Tomorrow we shall also be voting on amendments.
We would then be five years down the line.
The latter is particularly welcome.
Perhaps the Commission could comment on that.
This is an appalling waste of resources.
There is no specific impact assessment.
Â Â  â Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
I therefore congratulate the Commission on its work.
What is Parliament contributing?
And in this regard we will support the Commission.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this draft directive raises several problems.
A similar issue appears in the Forest-Focus programme.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
My penultimate point concerns potassium nitrate.
The last point regards the database for land-use planning.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
The proposals would certainly achieve the objective.
Batch systems can work.
Common sense and economics should dictate which is used.
Let me take you through a scenario.
We also need a system that will be practical.
I hope it will be afforded to them.
Â Â  â Someone applauded in the public gallery.
Congratulations, Mr Adam.
We are all unanimous in this view.
That will work, can work and is controllable.
They have been battered for far too long.
Many farmers do not even sleep for days.
This does nothing for the industry.
Where is it traceable to?
How can there be traceability there?
The agricultural industry cannot take any more of this.
This is sincere and from the heart.
This is the people talking.
I think that everyone is awaiting your reply.
The Commission can agree to the linguistic Amendment 12.
Â Â  .
I take it that is the Commission's position.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
I support the observations of the Italian Presidency.
The Commission sees this as being essential.
We need to be aware of that.
That is not the case.
That is the heart of the matter here.
The Convention's draft points in the right direction.
We deeply appreciate that work.
I took that information to the Conference of Presidents.
I underline 'on behalf of Parliament'.
We cannot systematically act on an intergovernmental basis.
Why has this been paralysed for ten years?
Why does Ecofin have power over the European Council?
We never liked the Treaty of Nice.
This Parliament has acted with responsibility when given responsibility.
One hopes that this is a wise decision.
These are not minor issues.
Alas, that is not the case.
That would clearly be foolish.
How should we respond to this?
Well!
Should we rejoice at this?
We should not trust still waters.
That is no longer the case today.
One of two things could be at work here.
Let me give you an example.
Who exactly is calling the tune in Europe?
The negotiations focus on two central elements.
I remember that this issue was mentioned several times.
Firstly, the role of the European Parliament.
The very foundations of this right are being attacked.
That means that there is a predetermined planning procedure.
Nothing has changed there.
What is this all about?
That has always been the case down the centuries.
It is Parliament that does this.
Parliament gives something and receives something in return.
This is something on which we must stand firm.
A number of questions remain.
Scotland and the fisheries issue spring to mind.
It should be reformed or else abolished.
In the UK that number is 86%.
That is not a democratic situation.
I rather think that this Constitution proposes something different.
We would like to see this group growing larger.
That is the simple truth.
That is unacceptable.
Whoever proposes the lowest quantity is bound to win.
It will need to intervene to improve one thing.
Frankly, I do not believe that is possible.
I cannot see how else we could proceed.
Â Â  .
It is not as if the problems are insurmountable.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Verheugen.
What role is it to play?
This short-term thinking is extremely dangerous.
Today, unfortunately, things are very different.
Our individualist societies are constantly refining individual rights.
That is all very well!
But we must not forget collective rights.
Morocco, the occupying power opposes it.
Firstly, facilitating freedom of exchanges.
I believe we must make a great effort here.
We could combat illegal immigration organised by human traffickers.
Development cooperation?
Whatever is needed and more.
Now we have the Mediterranean on the next page.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I hope that you will forgive me.
Â Â  â Do not worry, Mr Lisi.
The language services will be informed.
Â Â  .
I refer to Amendments Nos 11 and 12.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
They will resume immediately after the formal sitting.
I give the floor to MrÂ Chichester.
Could you clarify the situation?
(1)
Â Â  .
There are some translation problems here.
Trade boycotts generally harm vulnerable people in poor countries.
The other regions of the world are ignored.
This is an extremely important convention.
I voted in favour.
We obviously have nothing against better information security.
Â Â  I voted in favour of this proposal.
I fully agree.
(a) information and health education for European citizens
(c) periodic checks on the quality of screening
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
This is clearly a very sensitive issue.
We have to be very careful.
The Irish Government must vote against this!
That is the only logical and honest approach.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Furthermore the results would be made public.
This research also presents technical problems.
Â Â  .
There has certainly been no debate in DÃ¡il Ãireann.
The environment recognises no borders and concerns everyone.
Â Â  â That concludes this morningâs agenda.
These, therefore, are the reasons.
We have grand strategies but small deeds.
We have visions but little practice.
Those are quite clearly areas of common interest.
I will begin with environmental problems.
What conclusions can we draw from all this?
That is where there are deficits.
It is a major asset for Europe.
We demand the implementation of human rights.
Should there not be a joint Chechnya conference?
We need aid organisations here quickly.
The ELDR Group welcomed this EU-Russia summit.
I do not think so.
In fact, there is no such sovereignty.
Why not in the framework of the partnership agreements?
Why are matters like this?
It is therefore the same situation on both sides.
I believe there is a fundamental problem here.
There is the European Parliament.
âWe need you, MrÂ Putin.â
Let us put ourselves in his heartrending situation.
I have three children of my own.
I am very pleased to hear it.
Similarly, the case is causing us great concern.
True European commitment should be met by Russian reciprocity.
We need cooperation, not confrontation.
Has there not been a massacre in Chechnya?
You have also spoken about Arjan Erkel.
That is extremely important.
You have given a justification for this.
What has happened since then?
Politics has been increasingly neutralised.
The same is true of the media.
There are hardly any really independent large media left.
Those are serious danger signals in Russia itself.
That would be as many as under Josef Stalin.
But Russia has set strict criteria for itself.
It has joined the Council of Europe.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Thursday.
The institutional question is also addressed in the report.
That will not happen with every country simultaneously.
We are also expecting something from these countries.
I will say very precisely why.
As I said, responses have been positive.
In that regard it has therefore begun quite well.
We are on the same wavelength.
I must make that quite clear.
So please think this point over again.
That at any rate is a great step forward.
At least not in my lifetime.
Let us not run before we can walk!
We do not want any new division.
This enlarged Europe must be a security community.
Action plans form a good method of implementing this.
Europe has changed.
Why not Armenia?
Why not Georgia?
That is why I fear this uniformity.
Commissioner, you know my views on this.
The New Neighbourhood Instrument also contains very good ideas.
All of the measures must take this into account.
The Chechnya problem is not a secondary issue.
I understand his fears.
I hope these amendments will be adopted.
These two aspects need to be considered together.
This will increase regional prosperity and stability.
The Commission document proposes the economic element.
Moldova belongs historically and culturally to South-Eastern Europe.
That is the issue.
Enlargement will have a limit.
There is breathtaking ambition involved here.
That way we can promote democratic development.
But no one has mentioned this possibility either.
I am rather surprised by this.
I think that the concept is actually quite clear.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
This Second Action Plan covers the period 2004-2006.
This proved to be a very useful exercise.
The Russians will not manage alone in this.
In northern regions environmental questions are also vitally important.
Poverty causes sickness.
Will is the crucial element here too, however.
The Arctic environment and its people concern us all.
All of the others will be in.
There is no escaping this.
Then you mentioned Kaliningrad.
Each individual step was agreed with Lithuania.
That is quite impossible.
I can offer you full reassurance here.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Thursday.
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
Â Â  .
So far we have not received any reply.
Â Â  .
Everybody seems to acknowledge this.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.'
The position cannot change.
Â Â  I believe the Council is wrong here.
France is clearly breaching national fundamental rights here.
Clearly that is not being done in this case.
You are coming to the end of your presidency.
Once again, this has to be my answer.
The competent authorities are currently looking into specific measures.
Â Â  I would request your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
I cannot offer you any solution.
I just wish to remind us of this.
My supplementary question...
Â Â  Mrs Izquierdo, the Council is not present.
That concludes Question Time to the Council.
(5)
It concerns the creation of the European Armaments Agency.
That is good news.
We have tabled amendments to that effect.
This is heading in totally the wrong direction.
This is completely unacceptable.
Why people have to criticise this is beyond me.
This is something we should be welcoming.
That is our fundamental objection here.
That brings me to my final point.
Another point regards civil expenditure.
It is a good question.
It comes down to more bang for our buck.
The Eurofighter Typhoon is a superb aircraft.
Dassault is selling the Rafale.
We must be honest.
Hard training makes for easy battles.
We owe them nothing less.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
My second point is about Serbia and Montenegro.
We will adopt a neutral position.
In conclusion, the final topic.
In our view, this should not have happened.
I would specifically address Mr Swoboda in this respect.
We will need an agreement for this.
Â Â  .
Firstly, financial assistance.
The study points to both progress and continuing weaknesses.
Let me reiterate one key point.
Â Â  .
Things could get even better.
My congratulations to Mr Lagendijk.
What should the European Union do in these cases?
This is certainly not insignificant from an electoral viewpoint.
Allow me to be very direct and specific.
I would ask the Commission whether that is true.
Allow me to make three observations.
My third observation concerns paragraphs 51 and 52.
That is by the by.
Within the next two years!
There also appear to be signs of economic mobility.
None of us should entertain any false notions.
They are also their citizens.
All the state borders should remain stable.
And now, a comment outside my speech.
There is a technical issue.
Of particular concern is the case of Croatia.
I join others in welcoming Croatia's European aspirations.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Howitt.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  .
This statement by the Commission makes that clear.
We regard this as progress.
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs Stenzel.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
It must also be manageable and cost-effective.
The subject is frighteningly important.
I have no reason to doubt his concerns.
This is a retrograde, reactionary and inhuman policy.
We reject it and we will vote against.
No, it is something else.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  .
We share similar social models and global interests.
We expect talks to begin immediately in 2004.
We must deliver such action.
This means aligning our positions before major international meetings.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Watson.
The debate is closed.(1)
Â Â  .
Through membership we first realised our true potential.
The gauntlet has been well and truly lifted.
The Union's external relations agenda is simply vast.
It is the largest donor to AIDS programmes.
It could be the motto of the European Union.
We intend to honour it well.
Â Â  I thank the President on behalf of the House.
You are a splendid example of female political leadership.
The formal sitting is closed.
Â Â  We take note of your remarks, MrsÂ Figueiredo.
Â Â  .
This has been immensely helpful.
The Commission can partly accept Amendment 25.
The Commission can also partially accept Amendment 28.
I am grateful for the attention of the House.
Â Â  .
We can continue to extend it after the evaluation.
Â Â  .
I will therefore expand further on this point.
Â Â  .
These must be reduced to the absolute minimum.
Personally, I deplore that pronouncement.
I shall just comment on the individual reports.
Finally, the issue of the programme for women.
This is another key dimension.
So what citizenship are we discussing?
Every year we have refused to vote for them.
I shall confine myself to six of these comments.
The others are, by definition, anti-European.
It is not manufactured with the aid of subsidies.
This is regrettable.
I shall start with the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulous report.
Equality between men and women begins in the home.
This point must be crystal clear!
And naturally my group supports that approach.
Why?
That is the situation we are in.
Specific organisations should not be mentioned in this proposal.
This is in line with the Council position.
We want to ensure quality.
We want unity rather than polyphony.
According to an Italian proverb, silence means consent.
Let me give you just two examples.
Â Â  .
I am sure Mr SacrÃ©deus agrees.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at noon.
â I give the floor to MrÂ Bowis.
I thank the President of Parliament for his sympathy.
The correct one?
Or do the press already have the wrong one?
If not, we will proceed to the vote.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
We worked together very well.
(1)
(2)
Â Â  .
I think we all agree on that.
(3)
Our main reasons for rejecting this proposal are:
- inadequate and poorly-defined data protection.
As it stands, this text is unacceptable.
Â Â  .
We welcome the rejection of the directive on ports.
I welcome the rejection of this directive.
Â Â  Yes to liberalisation, but on the right terms.
Â Â  The principle of subsidiarity is important to us.
We have therefore abstained from voting on this matter.
I voted in favour.
We have therefore voted in favour of the report.
The same applies to universal respect for human rights.
Â Â  â.
This warrants my full support.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence my vote against.
Â Â  .
Consequently, I voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
That is something to be welcomed rather than criticised.
There is absolutely no argument here.
It is unacceptable.
For them peace means war and security means repression.
The Member States should spend more money on it.
New markets outside the EU will therefore be sought.
Taxpayers would thus get more from their taxes.
That is why I voted against this report.
External interference in wars has contributed to this.
Â Â  .
A laboratory constructed over the dead body of Yugoslavia!
The first challenge is to do away with protectorates.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
(4)
Â Â  .
I regret that Parliament was not informed.
They are not in jeopardy.
Mrs Bayona de Perogordo highlighted this.
The information centres are physically present in the provinces.
Yes.
Yes.
Do the Info-Points help meet that need?
Yes.
Yes.
That is questionable.
That really is not good enough.
It has been allocated over a good many years.
The English language is rich in expressions.
The tail is wagging the dog.
Experts should be on tap, not on top.
All that remains is to implement it.
It rocked the boat and people panicked.
Excellent.
Standards of monitoring have to be improved.
They are none the less hugely important.
Â Â  .
That is a political criticism we have to face.
We are not suggesting calls for proposals.
The Info-Points do not depend on us for survival.
We are certainly not doing that.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
I deeply regret the actions of President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
Norwegian assistance has played an indispensable part in this.
My party of visitors is well aware of that.
Significantly fewer people are falling victim to violence.
Growth stands at around 5% this year.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
Tens of thousands of civilians are reportedly displaced.
This has to stop.
Today, Aceh is in a state of emergency.
It is a debate about the escalating humanitarian crisis.
Healthcare and education have become impossible.
They are on duty in Aceh.
He is right.
We regard this decision as unacceptable.
In reality, the army is still in power.
Negotiations are alternated with forceful military intervention.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
Call in foreign co-financing organisations for this purpose.
Vietnam is a multiethnic, multicultural and multi-religious country.
The reality, though, is something else.
The issue is in the Commissionâs hands.
Let that give us courage when we debate Vietnam.
Â Â  .
We do not understand.
There is no freedom of religion in Vietnam.
We must therefore take a stand.
We cannot continue like this.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I shall respond very briefly.
This requires very delicate judgment.
Â Â  That ends the joint debate.
Â Â  That completes the agenda.(1)
Are there any comments?
Â Â  That will be a matter for the next part-session.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That is a very sensible suggestion.
(1)
Acquiring greater capacity remains our primary commitment.
You are both most welcome to this House.
Last week was no exception.
Public opinion would no longer accept it.
The European Union is faced with three major challenges.
Nothing less, but nothing more.
There is no explanation that would stand up.
I hope that the negotiations will leave this unchanged.
Let us start at the beginning, however.
We want the Italian Presidency to be a success.
We must not cede on this point.
Countries have borders, but principles do not.
They have been charged with no crimes.
There must be no repeat of Nice!
That is the situation.
You must get that into your head.
You must talk to the Poles.
You must talk to the Spanish.
I wish it every success in doing so.
Overall openness will diminish.
Legislative power is essentially being turned into executive power.
Eight countries can be outvoted and their wishes disregarded.
No comment.
This is the picture.
Bravo.
Bravo.
You are no different from the people in 1939.
Instead, it took them months and months.
This is a genuine political initiative.
The image of Srebrenica symbolises our failure to act.
Take the question of double majority, for example.
Time is marching on.
I do not think it will work.
That is the political signal we need to give.
Keep on trying to reach agreement.
Keep on working towards completion on 13 December.
I, too, have my criticisms of Naples.
Now the Convention has come up with a proposal.
The situation is getting no better.
Let me now turn to the Intergovernmental Conference.
What about Europeâs dignity?
Nobody said a word about that.
Europe cannot miss this extraordinary opportunity.
This Houseâs position is clear.
We are not just drawing up a resolution.
It will be a yardstick for confidence.
Let us pause and reflect upon this.
Malta will have five.
As a Scot, how could I think otherwise?
These are significant parts in the Union.
Do not do that.
This is not a trivial point.
I was not heeded.
My appeal was neglected.
What a pity!
They are talking about other issues.
We need to start making practical progress.
We must do much more with respect to that.
We need to demand much more of Member States.
Â Â  Thank you for your kind invitation, MrÂ Titley.
I welcome that.
I welcome any progress achieved.
This leads me to mention a second point.
What is going on now is embarrassing.
Do you never learn?
The EU faces huge tasks.
Moreover, it has major problems of legitimacy.
They deserve a democratic, dynamic and energetic EU.
I would therefore ask you please to be quiet.
These are not the core issues.
That is wholly unacceptable.
The draft Constitution represents a bottom line compromise.
What could be fairer?
There was deadlock.
What happened, in your own country Mr President?
The European Council exists to set down policy guidelines.
Why would that be?
Are we in favour of needless, additional regulation?
No.
That is right and proper.
The Europe we need is Community-oriented rather than intergovernmental.
It is normal for negotiations to take place.
I will reply briefly to Mr De Rossa.
It is pointless for us to hide it.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  .
Let us move on to procedural matters.
The Commission excluded it.
The necessary majority was not obtained.
The Pact has been called âstupidâ.
Other, new development initiatives must follow.
Proceedings for other countries will be affected.
It was not a good day for European law.
This argument is utterly false.
Todayâs debts are tomorrowâs taxes.
That is why the policy is wrong.
I really do ask that of you.
What about Portugal?
What is happening with Ireland?
Are they any different?
This is extremely serious.
Why is it so serious?
Minister Tremonti talked about factoring in economic cycles.
Today, the improvement in the situation is fragile.
We need a political actor in Brussels.
This is a matter of urgency.
I say again: the reform is essential.
We also need acts.
It was indeed stupid, doubly so in fact.
There is no time left to dither now.
A new, intelligent pact must be adopted.
Their confidence has been dealt a serious blow.
The justifiably devastating comments in the media speak volumes.
Do you realise what the role of chairman entails?
The wrong decisions can seriously damage the procedure.
The Commission has already been extremely flexible.
That is a good example of a bad manoeuvre.
It is never wise to by-pass freely accepted rules.
However, there will be no stability without growth.
The Pact is too rigid.
I agree with MrÂ Tremonti on this point.
Then there are sanctions that are impossible to impose.
It could do nothing else.
This is where I also agree with Mr Tremonti.
I am not calling here for American-style deficits â¦
The law must be respected.
With goodwill and imagination this circle can be squared.
As we all know, it will not.
Let us bury this Pact!
That is not acceptable.
This is very serious.
What should the Italian Presidency have done?
Left France and Germany free to act?
Rendered the whole process to date invalid?
At root, there are significantly deeper problems.
The euro is part of the problem.
The Pact is flexible enough as it is.
The problem is not so much the Pact.
Some people have called the Pact stupid.
That is the root of the problem before us.
The Stability Pact is called stupid or rigid.
However, it is not enough on its own.
This is what we must consider.
Some people have proposed a strategy for major work.
Dual standards.
That was the real tragedy.
Would there be a euro, Commissioner?
How very simple!
Thank you.
The Presidencyâs position has been totally impartial.
What we are talking about is a political process.
The substance is the same.
This was the case and this is absolutely clear.
There was total compliance.
Moreover, there has been no talk about substance.
All this in the face of limited governance capacity.
We need European governance.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
As such, they carry a heavy responsibility.
I regret that the Council is not present.
That is one of the principles of decoupling.
Â Â  This item has been dealt with.
Some important achievements have been made.
Not merely lip service, but concrete action!
'Europe begins in the regions'.
I thank you for the slightly extended speaking time.
Â Â  .
And Scotland itself has extremely varied regions.
Nowadays it is very difficult to sustain small towns.
What about the sustainable town?
All these things matter.
This phase has already begun.
Â Â  .
We need to improve the implementation of Community policy.
Obscurity leads to complete darkness, as we know.
It is essential to simplify legislation.
That is our disease.
This issue has to be addressed.
The reality is rather different.
I therefore do not understand your fears at all.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
I now turn to the individual points.
The OLAF Regulation is absolutely clear on this.
I therefore commend this report to the House.
I now turn to your report.
OLAF has a difficult transitional period behind it.
We should work on this together.
We are aware of this.
It must be fully independent of all the institutions.
Other things should be dealt with separately.
It is unacceptable.
We identify two main problems with the amendments.
We take an equally critical view of another problem.
That is quite wrong, in our view.
Genuine independence also means administrative independence.
This is something we will not go along with.
This gives a very amateurish impression.
Otherwise, her credibility will really torpedo.
Eurostat is a case in point.
We need a strong OLAF.
Let us move onto the report.
Why are these specific contracts always concluded here?
Mrs Theato has just mentioned them again.
We cannot tolerate this.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
We cannot amend this Regulation at the present time.
Â Â  .
These vessels had to reduce their crews.
It is asking you to do something.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
For that reason, I must reject this Amendment.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Stock management issues are also important.
This balanced agreement is in actual fact ideal.
Â Â  Mr President, it is me again.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
They were given no help.
Embalming is now common, technology has moved on.
This is a fundamental right.
Be brave.
Be courageous.
Accept the challenge.
The goodwill is there.
I now want the political initiative.
Â Â  .
I believe this issue is of particular importance.
This clearly runs counter to the Community approach.
30 years ago the world was very different.
Â Â  .
I want the principle to be accepted.
I am deeply saddened.
I need to correct the record in this regard.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
I am not convinced that this solution is feasible.
So let me ask you this, Commissioner.
That really is not the case.
Unfortunately, they are counterproductive in the current climate.
The proposal before us is a case in point.
The situation would become quite farcical.
The report provided by France also emphasised this.
I see no reason why these should be abolished.
Â Â  .
The Commission made it four years.
The whole idea therefore originates from the Council.
This is why they are experiments.
It is around 20% in most countries.
That is the standard rate.
But Annex K will no longer exist.
Â Â  .
I use them as they come in.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
As usual, only the early birds are present.
This is sound practice and should provide greater transparency.
Our assessment is based on several indicators.
Work undertaken by other auditors constituted the fourth element.
I would urge caution concerning the timetable.
This was the case at Commission level in particular.
Nonetheless, the figure remains high.
Nonetheless, the rate of implementation is still low.
This mostly concerns EAGGF-Guarantee and StructuralÂ Funds.
The activity management plans for the Directorates-General have improved.
The Court also recommends revising the timetable set.
To conclude, reform did make progress in 2002.
Progress was noted in all areas.
It will no doubt require adjustment and amendment.
The latter would be a risky venture.
This is the Commissionâs main responsibility.
The same applies to all the institutions.
Simply launching plans is not enough.
I trust it will be taken into account.
Thank you for your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
It is our accountant.
Let me again stress how far-reaching these reforms are.
That worked in our opinion.
What instruments of power are left to this Parliament?
The word 'indicators' is being bandied about.
Is it possible to develop indicators?
Is the Commission thinking about starting with this?
Enlargement is one example.
I shall come back to them later.
I shall now turn to budgetary management.
The surplus remains considerable.
We have stressed this on a number of occasions.
Serious shortcomings have been noted.
They are due to the longstanding in-house culture.
This means Commissioners are sometimes required to assume responsibility.
I believe that this is a real problem.
Much does certainly remain to be done.
Nonetheless, there is movement towards greater cooperation.
The estimates may prove overly optimistic.
Perhaps you should make your reports a bit clearer.
That is the simple view taken by our fellow-citizens.
This last report was published in NovemberÂ 2000.
It depends on how complex or extensive it is.
We feel this is this is a longer-term venture.
I believe we are on the right track.
I still believe this deadline is optimistic.
Progress cannot be achieved through constant doing and undoing.
That is how things stand.
The difficulty lies in quantifying the improvement.
Nonetheless, the Court is working with standards.
MrsÂ RÃ¼hle spoke of eliminating mistrust and increasing transparency.
She also called for more democracy.
Subsequently she referred to agriculture.
That is the problem.
It is one way of building good relations.
There is the Anglo-Saxon system and the European system.
We are working to harmonise them.
Thank you for your attention.
We have to stick to very strict timetables.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This can be made simpler and faster.
This will become simpler.
This discrimination has therefore now been lifted.
This is hopelessly complicated.
That too is a vast improvement.
This is something that we all insisted on.
The figures pertaining to this matter are interesting.
I do not share this wish for harmonisation.
I certainly have no European sentiment in this matter.
Wonderful!
All this signals an attack on the workers.
It is only an administrative simplification.
Responsibility for payment also lies with the Member States.
We do not yet have a European card.
I am infinitely grateful to you all.
There are very few criticisms here.
Â Â  .
My second point concerns the procedures.
The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 8 to 34.
âThat concludes the debate.
The vote will take place shortly.
Â Â  If I find out I shall let you know!
Â Â  .
(1)
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
The oral amendment is purely editorial in nature.
(1)
(2)
Â Â  âWe now continue with the vote.
âThat concludes the vote.
It is a modern form of colonialism.
The rapporteurâs proposals improve the Commission proposal.
Â Â  .
I voted for the report.
Â Â  We have today voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It can be criticised, however, for:
Hence our abstention from the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is a challenge and an opportunity.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is a modern form of colonialism.
Â Â  .
This has had a beneficial impact on employment.
There are also other positive effects.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against the resolution.
Â Â  .
This is simply unacceptable!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is basically a question of democracy.
That is the background to the position I adopted.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This will lead to chaos.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
I have received no requests for changes.
The deadlines were abysmal.
Are there any other comments on this matter?
I would strongly advise against taking this text.
Â Â  I should like to clarify matters.
Â Â  We have made several points here.
They have come to Strasbourg on a familiarisation visit.
They are very welcome.
I have to say something that relates to you.
Â Â  Especially if you are sponsoring it, Mr MacCormick.
I was opposed to it.
The deadline for submitting applications is 31 December.
Seventy thousand of these internees are still alive.
We cannot accept this resolution.
A similar decision was taken for Mr Vojislav Seselj.
Â Â  You did so in twice the time allowed.
Â Â  .
The directive should therefore accord with this principle.
This point has been clarified in the compromise package.
Anonymity is another important issue.
Finally, a word on organs.
Our rapporteurâs conclusion is well argued.
This view is also widely shared within the Council.
So be it!
Fortunately they clarify some provisions of the text.
The compromise on unpaid donations causes us a dilemma.
The inclusion of the recital is merely a pretext.
It is their only ray of hope.
Who are these people?
Who are these people?
We now have a compromise.
That is the way forward.
Â Â  .
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  .
The rest we can leave to the markets.
People from all quarters of this House were involved.
There is no reason to go further.
Â Â  .
There is no doubt about that.
Why then is this draft worth supporting?
It does no harm, it does some good.
But all that is politically attainable at present.
That is why the references are there.
Â Â  .
There is more.
What is happening now?
I think that is incredibly strange.
It is an old-fashioned, unrealistic and out-of-date idea.
That is absolutely fundamental.
There must be certain rights.
Employees are not just pawns on the chess board.
There is no choice.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
Without jobs, Europe will not survive.
I personally have had some difficulty with this debate.
Unacceptably, no such guarantees are given.
We have tabled those amendments to improve matters.
Consequently, the proposed compromise receives our approval.
Continuity and employment remain of major importance during takeovers.
Parliament was in favour of harmonising the law.
Europe certainly needs positive results right now!
That is a basic prerequisite of the market economy.
The reason for that is simple.
Different voting values are a clear and straightforward system.
There are no pitfalls or secrets in this system.
Â Â  .
That is a long way off.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
These facts no longer hold true.
The postal market is now largely liberalised.
A VAT exemption is not an unmixed blessing.
Â Â  .
I agree with the Commissionâs assessment.
All my proposals were voted down by the committee.
Talk of price rises is seriously exaggerated.
Another sensitive subject is the impact on charities.
I appeal to our Socialist Members in particular.
The complications are now evident.
Not to privatise would be the best solution.
What is this all about?
Â Â  .
They are taxable in all other cases.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, at noon.
This level playing field is of huge importance.
We need this big stick.
Â Â  .
It cannot therefore support Amendment No 45.
It agreed consequently to amend its proposal.
The Commission will therefore not support those amendments.
This does not seem to be the case.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
Efforts must be made to obtain this data.
Amendments to this effect are before the House.
No doubt the situation is similar elsewhere.
That would be a scandal and must not happen.
Allow me to take a practical example.
Various views were expressed during the debate.
We have little room to manoeuvre.
I will mention them in no particular order.
We already have 'polluter-pays' legislation.
That is a fundamental shift in legislation.
It is a key point here.
Who is it going to be?
Therefore the Member States have a responsibility.
I hope they go through.
The Commissioner also talked about nuclear liability.
Another important point is compulsory insurance.
That is essential.
The polluter pays, and so he should.
I have to get something off my chest.
The rapporteur has made rather a hash of things.
Â Â  .
Difficult choices have to be made among competing interests.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I am grateful to the Commission for doing this.
However, the issue is an important one.
However, we cannot support the committee amendments.
There is not much dividing us.
It must be clear and simple.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
(1)
(1)
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
However, that setback is not necessarily a calamity.
Our working method has been visible and transparent.
I am talking about labour market and pension reforms.
This brings us to the matter of security.
The Convention did a good job.
Alone or together?
Divided or united?
Mr President, we congratulate you on this distinction.
In this responsibility we all share.
You did not even play in the second half.
We can see the results.
I believe this is an important fact.
The Convention has produced this text.
We have 95%.
It showed neither.
It may be possible to relaunch the European Union.
The summit conclusions are also a disappointment to us.
By your own standards, you have failed.
The project is now frozen for several months.
That is nothing to be pleased about.
We cannot accept such a view.
There is the rub.
A convention will not be enough either.
I hope you will tell me that it is.
Â Â  Like the Constitution then, it may become immortalised!
We are forced to meet in Strasbourg.
This is not the occasion to revisit that area.
That is not the case.
What can be done?
The constitution cannot emerge out of a watered-down compromise.
What was the actual compromise that was avoided?
Whom do I mean by âyouâ?
That is how the construction was blown apart.
The second is one of substance.
The Intergovernmental Conference brought itself down.
Nobody was against it.
Only in your own ranks did you have opponents.
Did you fail because you were aiming too high?
You were the cause of your own failure.
You never question yourselves.
We must have gone the wrong way.â
No.
Like all fanatics, you want heads to roll.
Negotiations are complete regarding 99% of it.
Then there is the encounter with the electorate.
Both MrÂ Leinen and I were among the speakers.
Ask the people.
The institutions are important, as is their reform.
Discussion of that brought the IGC down.
It is still on the table.
Therein lies the danger facing Europe.
What then has led to this failure?
This is no great tragedy.
In any event, we now all have responsibility.
The two camps are the optimists and the pessimists.
We can still do this.
It can all be resolved in due course.
Which of these two views is right?
That above all must be avoided.
We must focus on the points that remain.
They need updating, they need streamlining.
They need modernising.
We need the new Constitution.
We must recover our common sense.
We must consolidate the constitutional .
Many Members have done that already.
I very much regret that.
That is not the way to build peace.
That double legitimacy existed in the Convention.
They can be corrected, and they must be.
Let me put that question in very graphic terms.
Today, Europe stands at a turning point.
Long live the Constitution!
Lastly, Mr President-in-Office, information.
Some Member States said yes, others no.
Therefore, the Constitution project has not failed.
Everyone has granted me that.
Not everyone gets a fair share of the plunder.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
If only.
We first saw this when the Danes vetoed Maastricht.
The agreement is a significant step forward.
(1)
There is nothing there at the present time.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
You can therefore easily give me two minutes.
That would not be included in the statistics.
Â Â  Thank you very much Mrs Lulling!
You always keep the House up to speed.
At last we have succeeded.
Â Â  .
Have a nice lunch!
(1)
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are therefore voting against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
We obviously voted against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The result obtained is quite satisfactory in this respect.
Â Â  â Mr President.
Â Â  .
We voted against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We voted for the latter.
These days, companies are commodities.
These two goals are not very compatible.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That view is shared by Commissioner Bolkestein.
Thank you and .
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the explications of vote.
(2)
I wish to make that proposal now.
Would that be possible?
Section I European Parliament
Section II â Council
Section III â Commission
Section IV Court of Justice
Section V Court of Auditors
Section VI Economic and Social Committee
Section VII Committee of the Regions
Section VIII(A) European Ombudsman
Section VII(B) European Data Protection Supervisor
We will put 25 posts in reserve.
My thanks for this.
Â Â  .
Earlier this year I outlined my main priorities.
I shall now encapsulate four of these priorities.
Secondly, to advocate greater reform.
Complacency will lead to gridlock.
This budget achieves value for money.
The pace of reform has to speed up.
It is an historic budget.
This is clearly reflected in the European budget.
How will the budget develop in the coming years?
The Commission firmly rejected this attempt.
Many thanks for the excellent cooperation.
But even then it was high drama!
Mr Mulder has already thanked the secretariat.
I have three good Vice-Chairmen who support me.
We have to start trusting each other.
We could have lived with what the Convention proposed.
It is a wonderful position to have held.
There is budgetary discipline.
Now they are to be phased out.
Terrific!
The same problem occurs in the recruitment of personnel.
I can well imagine the reasons for this.
This is something I consider essential.
Reforms are still required to improve management and transparency.
Export refunds are very susceptible to fraud.
This is simply asking for fraud carousels.
Internationally, they form the key players.
I would like to stick to three themes.
The first is the question of the Commission reform.
Mrs Buitenweg!
I see you are supporting me in the Chamber.
It is thrifty, sound and forward-looking.
This year, we have formed relatively few reserves.
We are therefore adopting a middle way.
This budget also shows that we are future-oriented.
We need to make preparations now.
However, we will also master the new challenges.
Naturally, we will be voting for it.
First of all, we put enlargement in place.
About time, too.
This is a vast amount of public money.
Everyone deserves credit.
First stumbling block, the duration of programmes.
It is undoubtedly a programme which can be extended.
And for what?
Is this the Europe that we want to build?
It most definitely is not.
We want to bring Europe closer to its people.
Unfortunately, we are seeing this now too.
Credit must be given where it is due.
We have to get tough.
What does Ecofin consist of?
That is the main problem at this time.
Last year it was Afghanistan.
But we have to forget about that.
Look at our next big spending: regional policy.
What does it do?
We are already unpopular.
Nobody is questioning the existence of the state.
The basic question is this.
Can the budget be used for political purposes?
The Committee on Budgets cannot do this.â
We greatly appreciate this.
The debate is closed.
Thus concludes our budget debate.
Commitments are decreasing; payments are decreasing.
The occupation must end immediately.
Â Â  The next item is Questions to the Council
(B5-0416/2003).
The next item is Question Time.
I hope you have understood my question.
There is a clarification of what you asked.
What did MrÂ Nogueira ask?
You have fifteen seconds for your point of order.
Â Â  â Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office.
I would repeat that this is a hostage issue.
Nor can the seaman who swabs the decks.
Nor can the salvage company manager.
Once again, I thank the Italian Presidency.
Â Â  . â No.
Â Â  You have misunderstood my question.
That is all I wanted to say.
That is what my question relates to.
The Council can also make political assessments.
Â Â  .
All I can do is repeat what I said.
Are they economic difficulties?
We must try to do more.
I am not currently able to reply.
I have just one more question.
Â Â  I do indeed believe so, yes.
Will the Council outline its policy towards this region?
So far, nothing has been done.
I therefore await clarification.
The Council has not yet received this amended proposal.
Â Â  The President-in-Office may have misunderstood my question.
Â Â  I understood perfectly.
Let me comment briefly on the key topics.
The provisions on data protection were another controversial topic.
I have put forward their arguments to the Council.
These two products are not incompatible, but complementary.
Innovations come at a price.
I therefore welcome the approach adopted by these directives.
These have been the subject of heated debate.
I know that this point raises further questions.
Such a list would never have been exhaustive.
Strengthening pharmacovigilance has therefore been one of our priorities.
This would not make any sense.
This is a very important issue for this Parliament.
We will be very vigilant on this point.
Â Â  .
First, the data protection scheme and generic competition.
The Commission welcomes the compromise solution.
This development is also to be welcomed.
Third, the environmental aspects.
This proposal concerns only market authorisation in Europe.
Finally, information to patients.
I will focus on just a few points.
Everyone has sacrificed something to find a balance.
I will remind you of just one figure.
Almost all the accession states are there represented.
I support the GrossetÃªte and MÃ¼ller reports.
They have done very good work.
Mr Liikanen may say that is impossible.
The accession states asked for certain derogations.
We asked what the dates were.
They gave us the dates.
The Commission said that these dates were fairly acceptable.
This is a very bad way of proceeding.
In my view, this was entirely unnecessary.
The ten years has been dropped.
That is a good thing.
That deficiency has now been remedied, however.
We shall hold the Commission to this.
American advertising of medicinal products is and remains banned.
We in the Verts/ALE Group welcome this.
Direct patient reporting did not make it.
Homeopathic medicinal products did not make it.
That is a major step forward.
I think we have achieved very important progress here.
We need to speed up procedures.
All this is very positive.
I am still sceptical.
Opposite my hotel, there was a large billboard.
I think we have achieved a great deal.
However, we must now put that into practice.
That is exactly what this legislation is about.
May I add some criticisms, however?
That is an omission.
My second point concerns homeopathic medicinal products.
I am genuinely sad about this.
My next point concerns Doha and medicinal products.
I agree with MrsÂ Corbeyâs comments.
I think that that is a shame.
We have missed an opportunity.
I recognise all that they have done.
Why such generosity?
I object.
Animal welfare and food safety must be our priority.
This is not a food safety issue.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteurs.
The pharmaceutical review is important for EU citizens.
This will cost the taxpayer less.
I urge colleagues to back the compromise on offer.
I hope that colleagues will support the compromise.
We should really be looking at them quite separately.
I will come back to that in a moment.
That is of particular importance.
We are not asking for that sort of thing.
That is very important.
I take a different view.
All these are things which directly benefit patients.
Is this something you really want to take forward?
Surely!
When will you ever learn?
It has done that for centuries.
You will drive it underground.
That is what you must do.
But we have that problem.
This sends out the wrong message.
Europe is about much more than this.
Europe can be much more than this.
That is the way forward.
You must be flexible.
It is chickening out of the situation.
I echo again what Mr Nicholson said.
That is what we are being asked for.
We have concerns regarding the enlargement countries.
I would like you to look at the texts.
You would call these compromises into question.
Â Â  .
Firstly, Mrs Corbey's written question on Doha.
I want to be very precise here.
Doha takes a strict position on the patent.
It does not take a position on data protection.
I hope that this has clarified the situation.
Then we will be able to start negotiations.
My position which my colleagues support is positively open.
We understand the transition period is a problem here.
Mr Liese raised the issue of paediatric medicines.
We will do that early in 2004.
He mentioned a case in Bratislava.
I know they feel very strongly about this issue.
Permanent derogations are exceptional.
Mr Nicholson mentioned internal affairs.
So there is an impact across the national borders.
Discussions regarding the pharmaceuticals industry are always problematic.
But this cannot be done without innovation.
So we need to pursue innovation.
Let us take the example of Alzheimer's Disease.
We must support innovation.
Compare the costs for a moment.
They remain at the same price level.
That is the balance we want to achieve.
Â Â  Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on a point of order?
Â Â  I am always polite.
It is a political position.
I cannot reopen the discussion on this matter.
You do not have a point of order.
They are important.
Â Â  Again, that is not a point of order.
I will make myself clear.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, please!
Â Â  .
However, I am ready to continue my reply.
We fully support it.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
On 27 November the parliamentary committee adopted two amendments.
The Commission supports these two clarifications.
This logical approach avoids overlapping jurisdictions.
I thank him for his cooperation throughout.
Last year I gave the example of echinacea root.
This is just not good enough.
The herbal sector is no longer a cottage industry.
I should like to thank Professor NisticÃ² once again.
These herbal supplements should be regulated under food law.
Health care must take precedence over commercial considerations.
Harmonisation should not mean that diversity is destroyed.
Traditional medicines should be protected as living traditions.
This must be taken into account.
I cannot therefore support the directive.
I, like MrsStihler, use echinacea.
I also use garlic.
Our citizens will not accept this.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
One matter remains before this long process reaches conclusion.
Â Â  .
This remains the competence of Member States.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
We worked well together.
There is no point in seeking confrontation needlessly.
I would therefore like to reciprocate his thanks.
It was a great pleasure working with him.
This must not, however, become the rule.
The compromises which have been found are acceptable.
Otherwise, I am very happy with the outcome.
I understand that this is a particular problem.
I congratulate the rapporteur again.
Is what we are doing here really necessary?
Do we need it to the extent envisaged?
I doubt it very much.
Are we not on the wrong track?
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
It would be as well to remember this.
Why?
Why?
We must therefore resolve this issue.
We have said it all before.
Please, please do not mess up this time.
This is why we have to be politically flexible.
This is something we must always make clear.
This part inevitably has to go its own way.
The second is the retirement age.
The third is national taxation.
A good start is half the battle.
Income tax must be levied on a national basis.
That is the very most we can accept.
The deadline, then, is 15 January.
So what is this about?
It is absolutely critical to these elections.
This deals with the amending of primary law.
I do not want to go over old ground.
As a result, we shall vote for it.
They are paid by the State as a whole.
Let us call a spade a spade.
The debate is closed.(1)
The vote will be at noon.
The progress made thus far is appreciable.
The committee has been quite active.
We believe that this is the completely wrong direction.
Please let us avoid a repeat of Rwanda.
First, traditional and local approaches to conflict settlement.
I have already addressed the specific aspect of fisheries.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The two are mutually dependent and reinforcing.
We have been systematically doing this through the years.
China is no small player.
We do not believe the time is ripe.
There is no prospect of democracy there.
That would be terrible.
But of course!
Terrific!
To do so would send completely the wrong message.
He is not so much Confucius as confused!
I am also thinking of Taiwan.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Everything else should be subjugated to it.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
(1)
The House has voted wisely and well.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Block No 1 will effectively subsume three other amendments.
(2)
(3)
That concludes the vote.
I regard that as unacceptable.
RC-B5-0543/2003 on the Membersâ Statute.
It is not acceptable
Â Â  .
The issue is its content.
This would be totally incomprehensible.
Hence our vote against the report.
RC-B5-0543/2003 on the Membersâ Statute.
It is not acceptable
Â Â  .
That was a milestone.
I was first elected to this Parliament in 1994.
Shame on them!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Another aspect which we support is national taxation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I support all attempts to tighten up this Directive.
Â Â  .
Let us see how that works first.
All else undermines conventions or existing law.
- supervise the market independently of the pharmaceutical industry;
- limit advertising of medicinal products;
- set up databases independently of the pharmaceutical companies.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This would be irresponsible.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Road safety must be a priority.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the report.
It welcomes the militarisation of the EU.
This is a war-torn country.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
(4)
It is also the right one.
Why is this so?
No, I do not believe that it is.
We want to take a more technology-neutral approach.
This, again, I ask you to support.
This new technology is fantastic.
Â Â  I thank the honourable Member.
This is also accepted by the Council.
We have also reviewed the timetable.
We shall therefore oppose these Italian proposals.
It seems to us that these precautions are necessary.
The original request was both highly illogical and unrealistic.
Amendments have been tabled to that effect.
These problems are inextricably linked to economic growth.
This requires modern technology.
That is taking matters too far.
Why do we insist on doing this?
Why are we recommending a satellite-based toll system?
Is the collapse in Germany not enough for us?
They are necessary.
This is only reasonable.
That is crucial.
A dynamic Europe needs road transport.
An ever more affluent Europe needs mobility.
Â Â  Thank you, Madam Commissioner and Vice-President.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
However, we could go no further.
Any other objections would therefore be inappropriate.
My group will endorse it.
There can be no talk of electioneering here.
Austria does not want that solution.
Nobody wants it.
Is that really your intention?
The Council initially went along with this.
Unnecessary internal irritation is far from constructive.
I therefore ask you to reject the report tomorrow.
It will apply for the whole of Austria.
But then it disappeared again.
That is my position.
That is a .
Noise aspects have not been taken into consideration.
Of course we can.
What should the solution be?
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 am.
Parliament attempted to address them by adopting 40 amendments.
What were the most important of these points?
That is not in the consumerâs interests.
My group therefore welcomes the regulation.
So how much are airlines making on this?
Airlines need to take responsibility for their passengers.
We are counting on that.
But that cannot be the case at all.
May I make one further remark in conclusion?
Even budget airlines must compensate their passengers.
I welcome many of the features.
I hope that will end.
That was not to be.
We must therefore deal with it.
I believe we have begun an interesting process.
It is clear that passengersâ rights are sacred.
I hope so but I am not altogether sure.
Nevertheless, we shall be giving it our support.
What we have before us today is not perfect.
I cite the package travel directive as one example.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this regulation.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission
That was less than in previous years.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for your reply.
Is that still within your field of competence?
The situation is unacceptable.
I would like to make one preliminary remark.
I am sure you agree with me.
This promotes the trade in women and children.
We must work on an extremely broad front.
Is there progress when it comes to police cooperation?
Â Â  . â Two brief comments, honourable Member.
I think we should not misunderstand one another.
Â Â  . â I do not know, honourable Member.
I had to say that first.
You know that, of course.
I was astonished by his opening political statement.
Not surprisingly his health suffered.
That is why it is an accession issue.
Â Â  I agree with Mr Bowis.
It is one that I am happy to answer.
I agree with you, Mrs McKenna.
This must be made very clear.
These are recent statements, made yesterday or today.
That is how he addressed the results.
I had a long talk with him.
There is a point of order.
I must take advantage of you being here again.
I then asked a follow-on question.
Â Â  You are absolutely right, Mr Posselt.
How many embryos could be destroyed in this process?
In which Member States are these embryos?
I shall continue in French.
That is my first question.
It is not the first time this has happened.
If not, why not?
And that is not unfair competition.
They are quite simply different situations.
Perhaps UPS flies to Athens.
And that is how competition works.
That is another story, however.
What you have said is absolutely right, however.
This management is the responsibility of the airports.
That was our reply a few days ago.
There are no shortages on the world coal market.
I have already said this today.
Work has already begun to the north of Vigo.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Â Â  â Commissioner, a very good evening to you.
The first reading in Parliament was very controversial.
The second reading was much more consensus-oriented.
Legal and other barriers are to be removed.
I think we worked well together.
A standard definition of cogeneration is essential.
Energy is very important in this support system.
I think we have achieved the best possible result.
We are pioneers in this field.
I would like to mention one detail.
The EU is very dependent on imports of energy.
It is essential to increase the share of cogeneration.
This directive can create a framework for increased cogeneration.
The Council has acknowledged our compromise.
At that time we had not received any letter.
So we have made some progress.
It means Christmas Holiday Package.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.
We are making a considerable effort in this direction.
In other areas the geographical instruments may be used.
That is truly decentralised cooperation.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m tomorrow.
I sincerely hope this is still a reality.
The resources are simply not there.
It is important that they should be practical.
It covers the period from 2004 to 2006.
A great deal remains left to be done.
That costs money.
That is why I welcome the action programme.
We all know this as well.
That is what I wish to call for now.
We have not fulfilled our pledges.
It is completely unacceptable.
The resources used often do not reach their destination.
I do not accept that the Commission is male-dominated.
This is mainstreaming.
Â Â  We shall treat that as an olive branch.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.
It focuses on coexistence.
That is what this report is about.
There must be clarity.
They are fully entitled to do so.
We have legislation on the subject.
This, then, is the crux for coexistence.
Our report places great emphasis on this point.
I shall comment briefly on some of them.
The rapporteur has said that.
That question has long been decided.
This subject has already been addressed by Mrs Scheele.
He mentioned organic farming.
How does the consumer react?
We know too little about this.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.
They generate over 30Â 000 local jobs.
This is true for both sides.
I express my regret for the delay.
Â Â  .
This is no exception.
That is the position of CÃ´te d'Ivoire today.
This is happening on a country-by-country basis.
I would thus urge Parliament to stop this.
Mrs McKenna made some very relevant points, however.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.
(1)
(1)
Â Â  .
Two out of three sufferers are women.
We could strive more to improve conditions for everyone.
Â Â  .
It will lead to concrete action.
Indeed it is not even a Member State issue.
All of these are good and positive things.
They are unnecessary and divisive.
I close by saying that I welcome this report.
It demonstrates what tenacity can achieve.
It talks about equal access to health care.
Let us hope that we now get that timetable.
Allow me to tell a personal story.
She asked me to look at my twin brother.
I will name them: Shell UK.
I have told this story for two reasons.
We have no problems with travel.
MS demands our attention.
That is as it should be.
Access to medicines and new treatments is essential.
MS patients deserve better.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
So we can set an example.
My final point concerns our engagement as parliamentarians.
The action plan is very important for this objective.
Electronic democracy is perhaps the core issue.
And the answers are not always easy.
What kind of information society do we live in?
As I say, international cooperation is needed.
In spite of this, nothing is happening.
All Internet surfers are imprisoned there too.
Why not?
Let us be logical.
The freedom of the information society does not mean .
That cannot work.
The information society is not simply a market.
Firstly, there is the issue of financing.
Secondly, there is the issue of human rights.
Naturally, there are many other issues as well.
That is a sorry story even here in Europe.
Hopefully, the Commission will reconsider its position here.
There are no limits to knowledge-based development.
Abuse is a separate problem.
Â Â  Mr Cappato, I have noted your comments.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
This must include the right to freedom of opinion.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are concluding this matter at second reading.
(1)
The two issues must be kept separate.
Let me make a comment on Galileo.
Amendment Nos 43 and 48 are identical.
They both aim to achieve the same thing.
I would therefore ask you to support it.
Please, ladies and gentlemen, take heart.
Â Â  We have had the debate on that.
We are now voting.
So please reject Amendment No 5.
(2)
(3)
It is an entirely appropriate vote at this time.
That concludes the vote.
I wish you a happy Christmas.
Â Â  .
History is repeating itself again this year.
For those two reasons, I am voting against.
That is why I voted against it.
So be it!
Measures must be taken to combat cheating and fraud.
This is not a responsible attitude.
We reject this idea.
We therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Situations outside an airline's control cannot be foreseen.
The Commission failed to provide a financial impact assessment.
Â Â  .
The IGC needs to come to a conclusion.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is incomprehensible and derisory!
This Europe would be more socially and democratically advantageous.
Surely not.
Quite the opposite.
I voted against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Heads of Government have failed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is a position that we reject.
The road network has meanwhile grown tremendously.
I support this change.
Â Â  .
I broadly agree with the European Commission proposal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Furthermore, the agreement has contributed to local development.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is what integrating Europe is really about!
Furthermore, it betrays Schuman and the European spirit.
Â Â  .
Does China respect human rights?
Â Â  .
As yet, none of this has been clarified.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The principle of subsidiarity must be fully respected.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The plenary has spoken.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
(4)
Significant regional development measures may be financed.
You said so yourself, Commissioner.
Aids are in the process of changing.
But what can we do about it?
But for how long?
That is the most important of it.
What is to be done?
Who will pay?
From which budget?
The crux of the matter lies elsewhere, however.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Thousands of jobs have disappeared under the water.
Those stricken in the RhÃ´ne Delta expect nothing less.
Â Â  .
My impression was that they are very good people.
I enjoyed that.
Georgia is also beset by troubles.
Money is made from kidnapping foreigners.
Firstly, there is the terrible economic situation.
My second great concern is the role of Russia.
This has to stop.
Georgia cannot do it alone.
One way is for us to offer mediation.
This really has to stop.
There is now a chance for a new beginning.
The problem facing Georgia today is no different.
We must not follow Mr Meijerâs example.
This is what is at stake.
Then President Gamsakhurdia was murdered.
Georgia is a country with a great European tradition.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
One of them is precisely the death penalty.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the death penalty is an abomination.
Since then, there have only been weak governments.
We must make one thing very clear.
Innocent people too are at risk.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
What was that we were saying about EU priorities?
The honourable Members know the rules.
Thank you very much for your positive information.
That cannot happen without Russia.
A second meeting will be held in January 2004.
Â Â  â Thank, you, Commissioner.
Â Â  â The House has completed its business.
Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
(1)
Therefore, the Chamber should be fully operational.
Does the House agree?
This seems to be a mediaeval situation.
Sport and friendship go hand in hand.
The trial continues at Aveiro Criminal Court tomorrow.
I do not think he will find anything.
That is likely to bankrupt many boats.
AcciÃ³ Cultural has more than 9 000 members.
All those attacks have been reported to the police.
On this occasion it concerns embarkation.
The plane was then very late in leaving.
Could you perhaps ask that these facilities be improved?
Â Â  The Commissioner can take note of that.
Later she may wish to make a brief remark.
We will not have a debate now.
The Commissioner heard your point and can respond appropriately.
Mr Prodi did not deny those comments.
Today my honourable friend Mr Patakis reiterated this request.
Â Â  The request is noted.
Mr Gorostiaga, this is not a debate.
I always try to accommodate Members â you included.
Â Â  .
We are talking here about a different case.
The Community has no competence in this area.
Where are we now?
No airline is immune from accidents.
The first question concerns States.
Was it due to inadequate cooperation or inadequate controls?
How are the SAFA programmes applied?
It is very useful to listen to them.
Unfortunately, we are still waiting for the directive.
This is why we need more European solutions.
I will certainly come and listen.
Why could that not become EU law?
This reminds me of safety in shipping.
Could we not do what the Americans are doing?
Another text has been under discussion since 2002.
Lists have been made of rust-bucket ships.
We must now do the same for aircraft.
Labelling and traceability are necessary in aviation as well.
Let us be careful.
I agree with what she has said.
I wish, however, to warn against contagion.
Perhaps we can do something about that.
Hopefully that should satisfy Parliament.
I think we can do things better.
Â Â  .
Thank you, Mr President.
This task falls to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
The next issue relates to the communication of data.
I believe they have been extremely important.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Now we are going to talk about maritime safety.
In other words, intention and serious negligence.
The Commission fully agrees with these proposals.
That is a perplexing situation.
There are sufficient rules internationally to address the situation.
Firstly, it includes passenger ships.
We absolutely must do something about this.
Such arguments must not be given a hearing.
We can do something about them.
I think that we should draw this distinction.
A year has now passed.
We must be careful about this.
It was frustrating on occasions.
Ships must also be built more robustly.
This is no coincidence.
This is why this report is so important.
Europe must act.
How will the Commission react to this?
In for a penny, in for a pound.
I do not know how we would have coped.
The agency should be properly staffed and funded.
It certainly is not at the moment.
I can assure you they do not need that.
Our Temporary Committee absolutely must tackle this crucial question.
Today, let us be clear.
There must indeed be penalties for illegal discharges.
That would be unacceptable.
Once again.
This directive must be applied.
Mr Ortuondo Larrea and others referred to flags.
This is something of a distraction.
British Conservative MEPs will oppose those amendments.
I most certainly am not.
I am simply trying to look after myself.
Sudden drastic temperature changes should not be allowed.
Basically, it supports the Commissionâs position.
They improve the text of the Directive.
We are favourably inclined towards the ideas.
The latter may be modified in the future.
Nonetheless, some amendments are unacceptable.
We are particularly concerned about intentional discharge.
It is therefore a crucial issue.
We cannot accept the first amendment as it stands.
This is because of its non-legal nature.
This is the crux of our policy.
As such, it calls for special attention.
The Commission can accept AmendmentÂ NoÂ 3.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We will try to improve conditions in the building.
The debate is closed.
Voting will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  Â Thank you for your kind words, MrÂ President.
In addition, it will provide significant political support.
This is a sensitive issue.
Parliamentâs amendments have been studied.
The Commission is willing to show some flexibility.
Sweden has made a great deal of progress too.
We are prepared to allow flexibility in such circumstances.
The Commission does not wish to close any doors.
Quite the opposite is the case.
Such policies already exist for other areas.
Parliament and the Council adopted these proposals.
I never said so.
That is something different.
I would like to emphasise this again today.
We have to maintain our commitments.
That is something quite different.
The objective must be pursued.
It might prove necessary to consider other possibilities.
This is what I stated.
I put this forward and stand by it.
I think it is entirely reasonable.
That link has actually been scientifically proven.
Europe must therefore continue to take the lead.
Other countries will be responsible for the rise.
Nonetheless, there is a positive side to this.
They will be deemed to be fully developed.
Such duplication would have been inefficient.
Lastly, the nuclear package demonstrates something further.
Good intentions are not enough, however.
Such is not the case with this Commission proposal.
We have to move forward on that basis.
The Commission has no equivalent resources.
It was right to insist on that.
The Commission proposal is justified in this respect.
We on the committee have worked on this basis.
This too is missing from the present proposals.
I really would like to thank you for that.
In particular, he proposes an essential change.
Does it amount to freely circulating merchandise?
Your proposals, Commissioner, are totally misleading.
It will receive no support from my Group.
It only sets out basic obligations and general principles.
Where is the justification for this directive?
Think again, Commissioner.
This is a bureaucratic nightmare and a nonsense.
That is vitally important.
That is the vital role of this proposal.
That also will enhance public confidence.
I am glad that has been tackled.
I hope that will be forthcoming.
Citizens really worry about these issues.
I wish to comment on two things.
The first concerns waste.
It is public and easily accessible.
The method appears to be clearly delineated.
We are all entitled to our opinions.
Â Â  Commissioner, I shall begin on a humorous note.
I think your look suits you very well.
I will limit myself to segregated decommissioning funds.
I did not trust you at that time.
Today we know that you fooled us.
You understood very well what this is about.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, we know all about .
It is just too bad.
Such is life.
It also concerns the treatment of radioactive waste.
Medical procedures produce waste of this kind too.
The fight against cancer is one example.
I suggest all these aspects are discussed.
I can understand all the approaches to this issue.
Allow me to pose a further question.
All this actually means a great deal.
Ladies and gentlemen, this therefore amounts to guarantees.
That attitude beggars belief.
It will impact on waste management also.
Nonetheless, cut-off dates will be set.
Countries will therefore be forced to take decisions.
Quite the opposite is the case.
Research into waste disposal is being financed.
Finland has opted for this.
This is not a permanent facility.
This proposal also has significant implications for funding.
That would be something quite different.
I could quote a case where bankruptcy was declared.
The outgoing ItalianÂ Presidency presented a number of proposals.
I have a challenge for certain honourableÂ Members.
I mean specific measures, not mere declarations.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
All this work was dismissed as nonsense.
After that, we shall conclude.
I distrust the Commissioner.
Would the Commissioner agree to that?
This is very clear from the Council's response.
Â Â  Your minute is up, MrsÂ Ahern.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Romania recently applied for a loan.
The Commission could play a part in their closure.
Our proposal is as follows.
That is something that must be borne in mind.
That is not acceptable.
How much are renewable energy sources being subsidised?
I think that is right.
I believe that the argument still holds water today.
This is akin to Enron's creative accounting.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(1)
Â Â  We now come to the resolution on urgent procedure:
Some boast of a proud record of liberalisation.
Let us not fall short of those ideals.
In this case it is necessary, however.
To reject it would be an affront to democracy.
Â Â  .
Thirdly, we discussed the legal framework.
Alternatively, let us consider local transport.
How did we first get on to this topic?
Can we resolve the problems with competition law?
I want us to obtain more value for money.
My group cannot accept it.
This text is unacceptable as it now stands.
My group reaffirms the need for an evaluation.
We must defend those rights.
That is something we cannot live with.
Which services are not of economic interest?
Is not the education sector of economic interest?
Is not the health sector of economic interest?
I am a little unsure.
Is decentralisation a better alternative?
Numerous paragraphs are contradictory.
Services of general interest ensure security of supply.
Support from public funds is required.
We still have time to set matters right.
All these things have to be said.
Finally, the legal framework must be democratically structured.
We in this Parliament cannot abdicate our responsibilities.
This remains an unresolved issue at the present juncture.
This is surely the question that is being asked.
This is certainly the question we must clarify.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
It is all about striking this delicate balance.
Â Â  .
Even more in fact, given their distance away.
We must root out sluggish bureaucracy.
I am sure we all remember the Eurostat case.
Only then will we tackle bureaucracy seriously.
What emerged from the efforts concerned, however?
They were a waste of energy.
It is neither transparent nor comprehensible to the public.
That was a tragedy.
Why?
The second principle is supervision.
The third principle is the principle of responsibility.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
You received that communication.
It is clear.
Above all, we remain firmly attached to multilateralism.
That is the good news!
It is still too early to say.
This is, I believe, a welcome initiative.
The same goes for the G90.
This would read as follows: counterforce.
They want social power.
Now is the right time to do that.
That would make Lulaâs agenda credible.
But is flexibility still the issue today?
My first relates to agriculture.
Finally, this trade round is a development round.
How is that possible?
That is my first point.
You want to maintain your positions on agriculture.
Obviously I am thinking of water.
You even make a very questionable assertion.
The year 2004 must not be a forgotten year.
After all, a great deal is at stake.
This is not the case, as we see.
Â Â  .
It also has its own cultural and environmental value.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Consequently, this report broadly warrants our support.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These measures include providing victims with assistance and support.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Prevention is better than cure.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is the real scandal of the shipping register.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is why we voted against this report.
We need to reverse this way of thinking.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I too therefore voted in favour of these proposals.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
The Commissionâs proposal would appear justified.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
I too therefore voted in favour of these proposals.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This surely neither is good neighbourliness nor reflects an .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I too therefore voted in favour of these proposals.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Cereal harvests are similarly low and lacking in variety.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
We do not know who will be.
Now for my second question.
Where is the pain barrier?
Where do we really think it is?
The Singapore issues?
I think not.
Agriculture?
You see, where is our pain barrier?
Where do we go from our new position?
How right he is.
They are the backbone of their future.
The other press release mentions bullying.
Not at all.
We reformed.
That is the way forward.
The health crisis in Africa is an urgent problem.
What pledges can you make to Parliament today?
It is regrettable that they omit certain aspects.
I think that we should leave it at that.
That is our political objective for 2004.
I will now respond briefly to a few criticisms.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  . â Is the European Commission deaf?
Â Â  .
This results in overexploitation.
Resources are obviously required.
Â Â  .
National ownership is very important.
Â Â  .
Sensible action is vital and urgent for three reasons.
There is a third even more important point.
It is insufficiently precise.
However, we can do more here in Europe.
Tonnes of bushmeat are confiscated at Europe's airports.
We had our own inquiry.
Foot-and-mouth is prevalent in parts of western Africa.
Â Â  .
We have enough real problems to cope with.
We should respect that.
We have had the debate about the brain drain.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Only the assistance offered by Israel was rejected.
It must be something more than just polite chit-chat.
Short-term financial assistance simply is not enough.
We cannot accept that.
I do not think so.
The Bam disaster moved the entire world.
This would be another disaster with incalculable consequences.
Â Â  .
Politically, I agree that there are other disasters.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
He will have to do so at 9 p.m.
Thank you very much.
I thank all the Members for their cooperation.
Â Â  â Thank you, MrÂ Varela.
This brings me to market issues.
This approach has proved extremely successful.
What way is this to organise diaries?
I thoroughly endorse that analysis.
This is certainly something that consoles and encourages us.
This is no way to organise business.
This is therefore an important issue.
The same should naturally apply to fisheries products.
Commissioner Fischler spoke about third-country agreements.
I believe we are threatening the indigenous fisherman.
This is an industrial activity with strong historical traditions.
We can only support sustainable and responsible fishing.
The debate is therefore closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Â Â  .
Â Â  You know that this is Question Time.
Â Â  .
It is not justified by any legal basis.
I suggest we take a look at this.
Â Â  .
This is a very good opportunity.
Member States are already working together in this area.
That is rather a different matter.
The majority of e-mails are now spam.
Â Â  .
The Commission is reacting on several fronts.
Several actions are under way in this regard.
Let me mention some of them.
This is known as the Trojan Horse principle.
Â Â  .
Firstly, I thank Mrs Doyle for the question.
These documents maintain the same value for fluoride.
I am still not satisfied, however.
The evidence is extremely shaky in this area.
Â Â  .
We also ask the committee you mentioned.
There has been no reason to re-evaluate that advice.
It is also a matter for Member States.
Clearly there is a lack of public consent here.
Â Â  .
Fluoride can occur naturally.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you Commissioner for that comprehensive answer.
Does he have anything to say about that?
Â Â  .
He spoke about managing migration and legal migration.
Â Â  .
Has the agreement entered into force?
Â Â  .
I thank Mrs McKenna for her question.
The Commission continues to make further enquiries.
In Spain the situation has not changed.
We have to take responsibility for that.
Â Â  .
I repeat that this is a competence issue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for that very clear answer.
It is clearly a major problem for our country.
Â Â  .
I will then write to him in due course.
Â Â  .
It will deal with the other two mentioned.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The ratification of the Convention is still pending.
This will not be its top priority.
Â Â  .
It has not been easy even in those circumstances.
But the figures involved are very substantial.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There is no development without peace.
So there are still outstanding issues.
Â Â  .
Therefore I agree with honourable Member on that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time to the Commission
Â Â  .
I shall start with the Services Directive.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
It is disappointing that there are not more.
This is the crunch time for the internal market.
The Council must get on with it.
Thank you for this decision.
What would the consequences be?
I welcome the proposal on services.
Â Â  .
I will then move on to the other subject.
That is very bad.
I wish I could achieve this.
We are in the hands of the presidency.
Mrs Villiers complained that financial services are not included.
I hope that will happen soon.
I beg to differ.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Instead, they can retain their current successful standards.
We have genuinely moved a step forward.
I think this approach has been successful.
One point that applies to us all remains unresolved.
There are sound arguments for stopping using them immediately.
We know that phosphates lead to serious eutrophication.
Ideally, they should be phased out straight away.
We shall try to choose both routes.
I also have a question for the Commission.
Is it only France that has blocked the compromise?
There is a need for phosphate-free detergents.
It has dropped steadily since the 1980s.
The practice cannot be accepted for much longer.
It is long overdue.
I have accepted these arguments.
Let us not wait for that to happen.
Â Â  .
That solved the problem to a certain extent.
In many countries the authorities have acted.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Unfortunately, enough challenges still remain.
There is a need to develop new medicines.
This continent receives 60% of the resources.
We must quite clearly make efforts in both areas.
There is, however, the possibility of treatment.
Â Â  .
That is very important.
First of all, the industrial dimension.
A second point is research.
Thirdly, there is the issue of trade.
We call for the prompt implementation of this legislation.
Doha should not remain an empty promise.
Â Â  .
The situation has not become any less harrowing.
What kind of a future do they have?
A whole generation is at risk of being lost.
The European Union has set itself millennium objectives.
Fortunately, things are starting to change.
The impacts are probably most severe in Africa.
As people die, whole villages die as well.
Nonetheless, the general social context cannot be ignored.
The accessibility of medicines must be guaranteed.
The Black Death is back.
That is incredible.
I am dying'.
I also look to the oil-rich countries.
What are they doing?
How much are they contributing?
If not, why not?
What about Japan and others?
What chance do they have?
I know the Commissioner is committed.
He is brilliant.
I know this Parliament is behind him.
These examples could be continued .
President Prodi has supported this target.
It is common to steal billions.
The best remedy is taxation.
The rich oppose it.
It means sharing.
Charity is not solidarity; sharing is.
Capitalism thrives on greed, and so does poverty.
Â Â  .
For the EDF it is EUR 8 billion.
This is true for both budget and EDF areas.
The Commission is serious about that.
The TRIPS Agreement is being addressed by the Commission.
We look forward to doing this.
We will give this a very high priority.
Let us continue to make this a team effort.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Peace and stability are the prerequisites for any development.
Good governance is just as vital as stability.
Finally, this report is balanced.
Â Â  .
The Commission is committed to supporting pan-African initiatives.
This is therefore moving forward.
Should this not be of some concern to us?
Africa is not for sale.
Africa must be constructed by and for Africans.
I hear of terrible new cases every day.
Conditions in Zimbabwe are now spiralling out of control.
He has to get tough.
We need to set the people of Zimbabwe free.
It is important because it is a home-grown initiative.
It comes from the African nations.
We needed help from outside.
That was a lot of money.
That is what NEPAD was conceived to be.
We ought to support it.
Â Â  .
We should come back to this.
They wanted this to be taken up.
However, things are moving in the right direction.
Of course they had to institutionalise.
They would have run out of political authority.
This work is continuing.
It is very ambitious.
They know it is not going to be easy.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Privately financed education markets have largely been liberalised.
I recently visited China.
What were people talking about there?
They were talking about culture and about cultural diversity.
Moreover, the Chinese are supporting us within UNESCO.
This debate does not give us sufficient time.
That clearly applies to cultural values.
I would like to reiterate this call today.
There are several reasons for this.
Â Â  Madam President, the world is not a commodity.
We are going to continue in that direction.
That is how European policy should be.
We have now won a battle.
That would not achieve anything.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
(1)
Those powerful acts are quintessentially European.
Â Â  (1).
This will be of critical importance.
Radicalisation trends take us backwards.
Our country has also resisted this type of challenge.
The democratic forces are already guided by this need.
Reforms of the armed forces have been carried out.
Ideal and innocent people walk the skies.
(1)
This is Irelandâs sixth presidency.
There is important work to be done.
We must be prepared for the future.
A new constitution is fundamental to this.
We know what the outstanding issues are.
Various possible solutions have been proposed.
That process of consultation is well under way.
We will press forward with the future enlargement agenda.
We welcome the signs of progress in recent days.
We have achieved a great deal already.
We must also continue to implement further reforms.
A central challenge facing Europe continues to be competitiveness.
We will also focus on practical police cooperation.
This is particularly relevant in the case of Africa.
Six months is not a long time.
Our agenda is demanding and complex.
Â Â  .
2004 must be the year of the European Constitution.
The climate is becoming favourable to stimulating economic activity.
That is the priority.
Everyone needs to move into action now.
I would advise against any such discussion.
It is inherently wrong.
How would a core group work?
How would a two-speed Europe work?
It is a question of principle.
The Commission as a whole must be balanced.
Let me underline everything you said.
It is up to us to establish that equality.
We should tell our American friends so.
The same holds true for Chechnya.
This applies both to Guantanamo Bay and to Chechnya.
That is exactly what we need.
Our group will stand alongside you.
We wish you every success.
The second important challenge is economic.
There are no majorities here.
The Irish presidency is right to focus on enlargement.
December's tempers have cooled.
What has happened so far?
This must change.
Great importance is also attached to major projects.
This must change.
This must change.
What are we doing to protect the Palestinian people?
To be honest, we are doing very little.
This must change.
This is what I see as your greatest task.
I have heard some astounding things in this Chamber.
Based on self-interest, thereby making Europe unsustainable?
His proposal will not allow effective decision-making.
The discussions in the Chamber did not end there.
And yes, I will tell Mr Fischer so.
That is the true history of two-speed Europe.
You seem to rewrite history as it suits you.
Either
That is something I would like to see.
it is criminal.
We have to tell them so.
Then we need to talk straight to Iran.
We have to tell Iran that.
That means that if Americans come to Europe,
Equality all round!
Only then will we be partners worthy of respect.
We all have to acknowledge the fact.
Thank you.
Do not breach an agreement entered into with Poland.
That is the reality.
Parliamentary democracy must not be ignored.
We need to take both considerations equally seriously.
Let it come down to a test, however.
We in Northern Ireland have problems.
This would constitute a step towards stability and progress.
It is time we acted.
Another key issue is the Lisbon process.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Irish Presidency is very welcome.
I want to mention two of these.
We expect the EU to protest.
I mean the crisis for the currency union.
It is time to stop pretending.
How much progress have we made on this score?
We are far from reaching that point.
They need growth; they need jobs.
The policy followed since the Maastricht Treaty has failed.
What would its place be in the European Parliament?
We all need to have urgent clarification on that.
Mr Cohn-Bendit mocked your comments.
I will take them seriously and at face value.
Obviously, we share that view.
Simply making it flexible will not solve the problem.
Now we are told it is insufficient.
This new form of government simply does not work!
Be careful, Mr President-in-Office!
Enlargement is challenge of the decade.
Enlargement could make or break the European Union.
Therefore, we must have a constitutional treaty.
It defies belief that was the only reason.
The new Member States are used to annual scrutiny.
I actually wanted to respond to Mr Poettering.
We still intend to do a lot of campaigning.
Maybe MrÂ Fini â we do not know.
It is a dynamic process after all.
Allow me to make a further comment.
I put the same question to each presidency.
This is what the public expect from us.
Major epidemics are a case in point.
Europe begins with the citizens in their own regions.
Fourthly, we should support measures for proper governance.
In this case, prevention is better than cure.
Sixthly, we should back Parliament's subsidiarity proposal.
There have been a series of premature candidatures.
That is what this Parliament voted for.
My political group saw this when we visited Dublin.
Unfortunately, the reality of Europe is cruel.
Growth has broken down in the Union.
Unemployment is rising.
The Unionâs budget is negligible.
That would create more growth while unburdening national budgets.
Policy without financial resources is just an empty gesture.
That is all very well.
The other issue is the Statute for Members.
The Stability and Growth Pact is beginning to creak.
They want to run their own affairs.
It is multilateral solutions we need.
There are too many stakeholders.
We have a Commission office in New York.
We have a Council office in New York.
Good luck, we are right behind you!
Commissioner Busquinâs behaviour was also somewhat ambiguous.
Ireland has great confidence in the work for peace.
Â Â  .
We welcome the new Member States to the Union.
However, they should all recognise their own words.
I would like to thank everyone for that.
He stressed that point several times in his contribution.
We must now try to complete the process.
I shall say three things about that strategy.
We are not saying that.
Such an approach would be both short-sighted and counterproductive.
I am very committed to the European social model.
We shall do our best to implement it.
I shall say a final few words.
Everyone except two speakers spoke on the IGC.
I very much take to heart what you said.
Everyone else spoke on the European Convention.
I will do all I can to finalise it.
We need the help of Parliament.
The facts are simple.
Unfortunately, this is true.
We need a joint effort.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I will do that.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
The Rules of Procedure allow for this.
Â Â  .
Bono will be pleased.
You have voted only on the first part.
Â Â  I did not put Part I to the vote.
I put 36 to the vote.
I have received no request for a split vote.
We have voted on 36.
Â Â  .
I regard these tactics as unworthy of a parliament.
Well, life is like that!
That is how it is?
Do you not have anything else to say?
Well, you should!
Â Â  Colleagues, the Rules of Procedure are clear.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That concludes the vote.
We abstained.
Â Â  .
It is a modern form of colonialism.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Manufacturers may protest, but stricter measures are unavoidable.
No proposals are made in this respect, however.
We abstained on this report.
Â Â  .
We therefore voted against this report.
I do not wish to take such a risk.
Â Â  .
And it wants to speed things up.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is deplorable.
Fund providers must face up to their responsibilities.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
The European institutions themselves are often mono- or bilingual.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Linguistic diversity must also be retained within the EU.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This preservation requires specific actions.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted against.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
(1)
Â Â  .
Those values are essential conditions for membership.
We must never, however, become complacent.
It has been the standard-setter establishing monitoring mechanisms.
The 2003 session of the Commission was challenging.
A number of important EU initiatives fell in 2003.
This list is by no means exhaustive.
It must also inform the strategies of international organisations.
Â Â  .
The Commission therefore welcomes this debate.
Large and small must be in the same boat.
The people of Palestine have had enough.
The escalation continues to be dangerous and bloody.
All eyes turn now to Ireland.
Gatherings of more than two people are also prohibited.
It is not sufficient, however, to condemn.
The first is the death penalty.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
My last comments concern Mrs Bonino's remarks.
Â Â  .
Indeed, they are sensitive issues together.
We have some amazing statistics.
Integration is often an issue which is misrepresented.
It is a vital issue.
Â Â  .
The communication carries two key messages.
Thus we often have a reductionist image.
Everybody who wants to come?
I think that is impossible.
It makes practical suggestions.
We support the current text, including voting rights.
This is not an immediate process.
This cannot happen all at once.
It is true that we need improvements in integration.
I recognise the need for this.
Why am I now speaking specifically about employment?
All the rest follows from this.
There is extensive mistrust.
I can speak from my own experience.
We are now in another position.
Immigration policy is something else.
I am convinced that we need an immigration policy.
Immigrants must be integrated as soon as possible.
They went to the polls in very large numbers.
Thank you.
An active approach to integration is overdue.
That is how US power was built.
Who contributes the ideas?
Are the national parliaments consulted?
Who, moreover, does the actual drafting?
Will increased immigration from third countries help here?
That must continue to be the case in future.
Let us beware of eccentricities that amount to defamation.
That is not true.
Anyone who wants that should say so.
That would need a Treaty amendment.
This is not their only purpose, however.
Their rights cannot be separated from fundamental human rights.
The Irish Presidency also mentioned this point this morning.
Firstly, managing migratory flows.
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs Sartori.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  .
They are subjected to appalling cruelty.
Religious rights do not come into this.
Â Â  .
I thank the honourable Member.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This comes from the UK Public Health Minister.
That is the least that citizens will expect.
It is a disturbing reality that we face.
I accept that.
I will certainly take note of her last proposition.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Opinions differ, naturally.
Â Â  My position has been traduced.
I am asking for experts to assess the implications.
I am not saying that I am the expert.
Let us protect our people.
That is the bottom line I am asking for.
You know that you have that right.
But today only two Members may speak.
Â Â  .
That is what our Constitution says.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The first concerns only comitology.
Â Â  .
That is the key issue.
Â Â  .
I should very much like your opinion on this.
Â Â  .
Discussions are ongoing.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for your reply.
Â Â  .
I thank the Member for that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Those views are informed by our own different backgrounds.
Are Member State police in Albania yet?
If not, when will they arrive there?
Who is in command of them?
Â Â  .
Who do they report to?
Do they each report to their own national capital?
Do they report to Europol in The Hague?
Is there somebody in charge?
How is it organised?
Who is in charge?
Who liaises with whom?
Â Â  .
This is a new departure.
Â Â  .
The programme covers the period 2004 to 2006.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This issue was raised at that stage.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, President-in-Office, for your full reply.
Good luck, Sir!
Â Â  .
I thank the Member for that.
I accept the point that the Member made.
It is a complex issue.
Â Â  .
There are specific cases that come to mind.
We are aware of that.
Â Â  .
My reply will be very brief.
Â Â  .
I am sorry I cannot expand on this.
On what does this report focus?
The second priority is the standardised collection of data.
Â Â  .
Migration is a phenomenon of the contemporary world.
We cannot evade our responsibilities as rich nations.
People are right to want to flee horrendous situations.
This effectively plunders the productive forces of the South.
I agree with MrÂ SÃ¸rensen in that regard.
There are eight points that I wish to highlight:
- fifthly, the much-trumpeted European asylum system;
This is reinforced in points 16 and 17.
I welcome this report.
This is truly welcome.
No-one seems to be clear what this means.
There could be very practical problems.
This ambivalence cannot continue.
This is the wrong direction to take.
This is where our social concerns arise.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I want to emphasise that.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  .
That is what makes it regrettable.
We do not believe that to be the case.
Why is it so important?
There have been two important periods.
Both periods gave rise to a good few problems.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
The answer is clearly 'no'.
We are still awaiting a response.
Again, we are still waiting for a response.
I now recognise that it was a bad mistake.
This policy area is completely sidelined.
The strategy itself touched on risks in this area.
Well, we are still waiting.
That is the clearest justification for EU-level legislative action.
It is high time that the Commission acted.
Â Â  .
Mr Hughes asked for a timetable.
Combating this problem is an extremely difficult undertaking.
That might put a stop to their indifference.
We know that this is a major problem.
Why may we do so?
Job security also used to be very important.
This is an opportunity to do just that.
Nothing very much has happened at Member State level.
We need a commonsense approach rather than EU law.
It must be respected and protectedâ.
Are we certain of that?
I must take issue with the Commissioner.
They were part of the original physical agents proposal.
Â Â  .
I would thus like to thank the Members.
I do not accept Mr Hughes' last comment.
A second research project has been commissioned.
It is not an easy issue at all.
I thank Parliament.
I think we just about got there tonight.
The debate is closed.
(1)
(1)
We had a mass of amendments to vote on.
Â Â  â Thank you for that contribution, MrÂ Harbour.
Â Â  .
Harmonisation does not mean bland similarity.
The directive is important irrespective of its individual contents.
That should not happen.
We were unable to agree to that.
Especially sensitive activities must be subject to controls.
Â Â  .
This was adopted unanimously.
We are grateful to them.
That is something that many professionals need to do.
That is premature.
The horizontal approach is a good one.
But it is not an ideal solution.
There is, for example, the time criterion.
You would not have professions otherwise.
I beg to differ.
I would certainly deplore that.
They should also be clarified.
The engineering case has been mentioned.
There is a point here which we all share.
We need to develop a common platform.
I agree with that.
It says that the diplomas must be recognised.
Specific safeguards are necessary in the health care sector.
I too tabled amendments to abolish the 16-week rule.
However, it comes with a health warning.
I therefore welcome the Commissionâs proposal.
The activities are no different.
I do not think this distinction is right.
Â Â  .
My second point concerns facilitation of cross-border service provision.
Â Â  .
Those are my initial comments on the Kauppi Report.
Let me first address the issue of hedge funds.
Parmalat, , has shown the importance of that.
However, full tax consistency must be assured.
Warm congratulations, Piia, and all the best!
The main problem is one of procedure.
Parliament rejected that request on 2 September 2003.
Â Â  .
Ireland, Germany and Luxembourg are three such examples.
That should be clarified.
This will be a welcome advance.
I turn to the report by Mr Purvis.
He believes in the market.
Their incentive is merely a desire for money.
The traditional exchange of information cannot possibly keep up.
I therefore endorse the Commissionâs proposal.
Â Â  .
The legal base is an important point.
That is very regrettable.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
Â Â  .
Mr President.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
(1)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This text is far from satisfactory.
This extension should be able to convince them.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore abstained in the final vote.
Â Â  .
It must be respected and protectedâ.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Subsidiarity must apply.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted against.
This is an issue that affects all of us.
The watchword is âdiversity in unityâ.
Otherwise, we support the content of the report.
This is long overdue.
This, again, is long overdue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This explains our vote.
Â Â  .
What hypocrisy!
Â Â  .
Consequently, workers continue to suffer discrimination.
This explains our abstention in the final vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are the last to support the Iranian regime.
I am very concerned.
Explanations of vote are closed.
(2)
That was good, correct and important.
So far, so good.
These two areas must accompany copyright.
We still have to wait for the enforcement directive.
We waited for that promise for a long time.
Thank you in advance.
Good.
As I said, it was a long process.
We have talked to the most diverse of networks.
Sincere thanks once again to all who have helped.
Â Â  .
I congratulate Mrs Echerer on that.
The Commission shares the approach followed by this resolution.
Something needs to be done here.
So this is a very timely report.
This is not just an abstract piece of work.
Until printing there was no real intellectual property.
I would like finally to refer to enlargement.
This sparked fear and anxiety.
The rapporteur re-emphasised this point in her oral amendment.
It is a proposal I await eagerly.
Quite the reverse.
I will illustrate this with a few figures.
But far less attention is paid to economic crime.
It has become a lucrative market for organised crime.
Â Â  .
There is therefore nothing for me to comment on.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Mugabe must go.
Conditions in Zimbabwe are now spiralling out of control.
A once prosperous country has been ruined and destroyed.
Council and Commission, let your voices be heard!
We certainly want to see Mugabe out of office.
What are our own sanctions actually achieving?
The land reform in Zimbabwe is a disgrace.
It was proof that Africa was flourishing.
What destroyed Zimbabwe?
That would be too much.
That is what this issue is about.
Despite intimidation, people voted.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The people responsible must be held accountable and punished.
It is unclear who murdered Archbishop Courtney.
The peace process is very fragile.
Many people are guilty of extremely serious war crimes.
We have lost a true friend.
The recent peace agreements must be swiftly implemented.
On-going hostilities and human rights abuses must halt.
We should honour his memory.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Such is day-to-day political life in Haiti.
I could go on in this vein for hours.
We condemn all the violence and political assassinations.
Â Â  .
Such elements are not in place in Haiti.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
(1)
Â Â  â Parliament has completed its agenda.(1)
15 amendments could be accepted in their entirety:
110 amendments had to be rejected:
He shall refer the matter to the committee responsible.
That is what I have done.
We now need to build on that hope together.
We thank you for being here.
Â Â  .
Several more meetings are scheduled over the coming weeks.
We do not underestimate the complexity of our task.
It simplifies legal procedures and instruments.
It creates a single legal personality for the Union.
I want to repeat that message here today.
We have no hidden agendas, no pet projects.
We may, or may not, succeed.
Â Â  .
The first is that we want a general agreement.
Let me now mention a final point.
Let me conclude with words of hope.
... that is a misuse of the colour.
Where there is a will there is a way ...
Â Â  A commendable new form of 'inter-faith' dialogue!
I believe that would be a good start.
Why?
That is an important point.
Under the Constitution the present Union will be suspended.
We need social security and not European militarism.
We need referenda.
Ninety-six members of the Convention called for a referendum.
Referenda are peopleâs democracy.
It is not possible!
Are they or are they not a basis?
We all know what the bottom line issues are.
They are not a secret.
That is essential.
We reject this idea for two reasons.
We will fight any attempt to violate the law.
That would cause a stir.
Why is there this level of consensus?
How?
A Norwegian, please note.
We say âRIPâ.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
But that is the price of collegiality.
The example of defence is a very good one.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow.
Our approach has been clear all along.
The presidency undertook to report the outcome to Parliament.
Unfortunately that is not possible.
I regret the lost opportunity that your statement indicates.
Moreover, it is part of the legislative procedure.
We could then, perhaps, make progress.
That concludes the item.
Â Â  .
That is a suggestion for the Commissioner.
Now, no such services can be provided.
When shall we see a decision concerning Microsoft?
I am addressing you in particular, Commissioner.
In reality, the market is becoming an oligopoly.
France and Germany will not touch divestment policy.
These proposals would result in confusion and legal uncertainty.
Â Â  .
Several subjects have been touched upon.
Of course, imperfections remain in the single market.
I totally agree with Mr Karas.
The case concerned was one of monitoring of mergers.
Mrs Bordes, sometimes, human catastrophes may happen.
That is your expression.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow.
Such bans are misguided.
and
This is a first step in the right direction.
We also reached agreement on the charging regimes.
We should like some certainty on those points.
MrÂ Fava has already discussed this in detail.
Â Â  .
This is at best a start.
I see these proposals as positive developments.
I have met the operators.
Anything else would be irresponsible.
That is a priority for this entire Parliament.
Our efforts must not stop here.
We must thank her and congratulate her on that.
The result is satisfactory.
Â Â  .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
Relations with third countries have been normalised.
There are no problems with the Russian Glonass system.
Galileo is a very important achievement of our legislature.
Galileo is a fine European Union project.
Â Â  .
A large number of obstacles have been overcome.
That is something I cannot but welcome.
I believe this must continue.
This is an important contribution to transparency and accountability.
Two problems remain, however, I believe.
I think we must be very careful here.
Â Â  .
The issue of China and human rights.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.
and
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European Union delivers.
Complete transparency and equal treatment are guaranteed.
The administration of procurement will be considerably simplified.
Thank you, all who have contributed.
This is quite remarkable.
That is something we are really pleased about.
We must not be afraid of modern environmental technology.
That is what I myself am going to do.
I would now like to move forward.
They now have to work in practice.
We need to make sure that this is happening.
But why is this?
The Commissioner himself mentioned the huge figures involved.
Environmental issues are central.
That is a question that negotiators always ask themselves.
Â Â  .
The vote will be tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
The environmental impact of packaging must be minimised.
The third point relates to the report.
The fourth point concerns voluntary agreements.
The last of the minor points concerns the deadlines.
Parliament strongly defended its second reading position.
We have set some very tough targets.
I commend this package to the House.
Such alternatives do exist now.
This is a balance which I really welcome.
I welcome what is before us here this evening.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
I hope you will study this report carefully.
The results of these investigations were shocking.
This was not what we had asked for.
The OLAF report painted a quite different picture.
The criticism is too serious.
That is something we think cannot be done.
We have gone a long way since February 2003.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr BÃ¶sch.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
Let me go through them.
That is a clear alternative.
Frankly, the opposite has generally been true.
Well, that is wonderful, I must say.
We still believe that to be the case.
That was no small matter.
MrÂ Casacaâs report is not bad.
The rotten apple spoils the whole barrel.
What, too, about political responsibility?
That is regrettable, in my view.
Claiming ignorance is no defence against responsibility.
I would be delighted if that were to occur.
They have drawn attention to numerous abuses.
The current rules do not guarantee them protection.
How do you see this working?
Action is needed.
This House has tabled appropriate proposals for your attention.
I say this in all clarity.
We need clear priorities for OLAF.
I say that in all clarity as well.
We need priorities.
I would remind you of that, Commissioner.
We have to see political responsibility by individual commissions.
They have to shoulder this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
Personally, I am glad about it.
The first point is about the budget.
The third point concerns enlargement.
My final point is about US strategy.
But it does not serve anyone else.
Pursuing a grand design requires resources, however.
But we should also go beyond the intergovernmental level.
We cannot demand new competences without assuming the cost.
You mentioned President Bushâs statement.
It requires in-depth analysis.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Busquin.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
I have to say that such matters merit consideration.
How will the Commission translate proposals into specific actions?
- firstly: the vital role of structural funds.
- thirdly: bilateral trade agreements.
How does the Commissioner intend to prevent this?
My third point concerns labelling and certification.
A mere monitoring centre will not be sufficient.
That is the future for our industry.
This has become increasingly vital.
It will look after innovation, research and development.
Another topic is the question of intellectual property.
Research and development is certainly an important factor.
Â Â  Thank you very much Commissioner Busquin.
The debate is closed.
Why has Parliament produced a report on the subject?
Is there nothing more pressing?
No, that is not the reason.
The European Union needs a legal personality.
Â Â  .
The purpose of the communication was threefold.
And how best can we contribute to that endeavour?
Development and security are inextricably linked and mutually dependent.
The Commission will participate actively in this exercise.
It is not enough, however.
We will all then be the losers.
Multilateralism is being embraced as the new political gospel.
True peace and justice do not ensue from people.
Why is this enormous continent being excluded?
For fear of double vetoes, no doubt?
Finally, multilateralism is good but never unconditional.
We cannot, therefore, support it.
It should be international institutions that identify impending danger.
The issue is whether this is at all necessary.
We need to reform the Security Council.
Similarly, Nigeria or Brazil could be candidates.
Excellent!
Today circumstances are different and must be expressed.
I shall concentrate on four points.
This must be pursued in a UN context.
We must be able to reform the Security Council.
Â Â  .
Todayâs debate is timely.
The necessary consensus remains difficult to develop.
â Thank you, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council.
But how is democratic control to be exerted?
Sometimes, this creates more problems than it solves.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
(1)
That is why I voted against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
All of us want a strong United Nations.
This is irresponsible.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I give this proposal my unreserved support.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These points further justify my position.
Â Â  .
Hence our abstention from the vote.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is something I naturally welcome.
Â Â  .
We are therefore voting against these two directives.
Â Â  Mr President, my Group voted against this agreement.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
That is why I voted against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is why I voted against.
Â Â  Mr President, I also voted against this resolution.
It is completely unacceptable.
Something like this needs a lot more time.
Elections are the beginning of wisdom.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is why we voted against the resolution.
That is why I do not support it.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted against.
Â Â  .
Research is, of course, equally essential.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.(2)
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
You honour us with your presence today.
Â Â  .
They are with us in the Chamber now.
You have pursued the path of peace through multilateralism.
Many of your societies are already very diverse.
That movement is not going to stop.
Most immigrants are not refugees.
Some resort to people smugglers to assist their journey.
This silent human rights crisis shames our world.
Your populations are getting smaller and growing older.
Your economies would shrink and your societies could stagnate.
There is no simple solution to this problem.
The challenge of integration is real.
Integration is a two-way street.
That is the imperative for Europe today.
Yes, they may gain remittances.
This opens up new vistas for international cooperation.
They do not want a free ride.
They want a fair opportunity.
They are not criminals or terrorists.
They are law-abiding.
They do not want to live apart.
They want to integrate, while retaining their identity.
But the most essential ingredient of all is leadership.
The message is clear.
Migrants need Europe, but Europe also needs migrants.
Let us treat them that way.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Sergio Vieira de Mello was an extraordinary man.
... is not applied to people.
For all of this, we thank you.
You were right to do so.
Or is it?
Â Â  Does anyone wish to speak against the request?
Â Â  Mr President, my Group is against a resolution.
(1)
Â Â  I would welcome your note on the matter.
I hope that they are true to their tradition.
That is the answer to your question.
Her name is Yamha Mohammed.
This is another area of grave concern.
Â Â  .
There is a specific European angle on this matter.
They have created friction, especially in Germany.
Rating agencies must continue to do good work.
Â Â  .
I think Mr Katiforisâ report reflects this.
We must be realistic.
The top two worldwide rating agencies are American.
We will keep you informed in due course.
What is this actually about?
It is also important that Europe should do so.
I believe that it comes at an important time.
What role should redistribution have?
They are European initiatives.
These are complementary developments that we should reflect upon.
Above all, rating agencies assess companies and countries.
It is extremely bold, yet completely justified.
Â Â  .
Members discussed many questions.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow from 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
My proposals are also clear.
It is a horrendous precedent.
Â Â  .
The fourth point concerns 'opting out'.
There are various types of approach.
Your report is extremely topical and material.
I would just like to quote three short paragraphs.
But this was unusual.
I hope the social partners will make that clear.
The truth is that the directive is flexible.
We should not be discussing pay.
Another problem is the length of reference period.
This own-initiative report was nevertheless a necessary one.
Let me start with the general individual opt-out.
Do we want a minimum regime?
Let me give you one example.
That is certainly going a long way.
The current opt-out is open to all Member States.
Businesses care about modern forms of labour organisation.
Gradually, that programme was implemented.
They had to compete in other areas instead.
That is a retrograde step that is incomprehensible.
They have to take what is on offer.
So much for matters being voluntary.
This will lead to the exception becoming the rule.
That is not something we can live with.
That is a personal experience.
Good.
The proximity principle must be taken seriously.
We need clarification of the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments.
That is the first point.
Pressure is being exerted from two sides.
This comes firstly in relation to the individual opt-out.
Why stop here?
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at noon on Wednesday.
Â Â  .
I should like to mention three points.
Now the corresponding figure is 90%.
Children obey orders more readily than adults.
We are not that far yet.
Question time has also improved.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
and
Â Â  .
We avoided adopting easy or simplified ideological approaches.
Â Â  .
Such corruption takes various forms.
Secondly, there is social policy.
This sounds charitable, but is inappropriate.
Nobody can be opposed to gradual change.
Competition is very important in this area.
People must be able to expect it.
It cannot be based on the bottomless well principle.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(1)
(1)
Â Â  .
There are 6664 million birds in the affected areas.
I would like to make three points.
He briefly mentioned that.
Oh really?
I will come to that in a moment.
What bothers me is the permanent state of -action.
We are always -acting.
That is a mistake.
Let us protect them!
Have we done enough research?
What has been done about this conclusion?
Imports from Thailand and other countries have been suspended.
Is this true or not?
The Commission has chosen not to spend them.
Finally, a word about the OIE.
Thank you very much.
One case has been reported in the United States.
The first concerns the health aspect.
The second aspect concerns the Commissionâs work.
So this specific epidemic may change quickly and continually.
But we must not stop at that, Commissioner.
I need to get something else off my chest.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
Let me pick up Mr Mulderâs example.
Will they run the same risk with cooked meats?
Is this a risk to our consumers?
Why is this so, Commissioner?
This seems to be a loophole.
The order did not become valid until 6Â February.
My next question is as follows.
What do we do with those countries?
What do the consumers want?
They want the guarantee that they receive safe products.
A number of Members have already mentioned vaccines.
This is a very worrying aspect.
There is cause for grave concern.
Can we totally guarantee their safety?
I have three direct questions for you, Commissioner.
Mr Nicholson mentioned feathers.
What can be done to counter it?
Use vaccines?
How effective are they?
That makes it very difficult to control.
Â Â  .
There is ongoing work in relation to that also.
Mr Mulder asked me about the inspection systems.
But I had also been in Thailand.
Any suggestion that the Commission reacted slowly is incorrect.
He asked me about coordinating groups.
He asked me about links between globalisation and diseases.
The OIE in Paris continues evaluating the situation.
Mr de Roo asked me about borders.
I have already answered that question.
This is a Member State competence.
They report, and the reports are public.
Â Â  .
I believe that to be the case.
Â Â  .
This matter is under review.
They are being financed.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is neither bureaucratic, nor is it costly.
That is sensible.
I commend this measure to the House.
The Centre should provide this essential service.
I have hope, and that is everything.
I have little more than that.
By no means everyone can do these things.
I regard that as an intolerable state of affairs.
Thank you.
Such is the case this time too.
When it comes to tackling disease, Europe works.
I am still awaiting a reply.
Â Â  .
This is precisely what the centre aims to achieve.
The management board should steer policy and make decisions.
I conclude by thanking the rapporteur and Parliament.
We should be proud of ourselves today.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
The analysis of incomes is therefore of obvious interest.
The European Union cannot remain indifferent to this situation.
Our European agricultural model was legitimate in its conception.
It must become so in reality again.
The decoupling of payments from production was long overdue.
Let me quote you some figures.
That is not on.
That is what we Social Democrats are working for.
I thank you.
MrÂ Garot is a committed politician on agricultural matters.
It would have been very useful for us.
We have defended the agricultural reform.
That has been decided upon.
This is an area I am concerned about.
That amounts to an overall economic crash.
Will it ensure extensive agricultural land use?
That is something I do not want.
Mr Garot presents these facts very clearly.
No expert has been able to tell us that.
Its starting point is beyond dispute.
This is out of all proportion.
Of course, there is a reason for this.
The WTO Summit in Cancun has failed.
Protection remains necessary.
Greek farmers in particular are anxious about their future.
And strong regions mean strong farmers.
Regions without farmers mean a country without a future.
Â Â  â Thank you.
Your comment will be passed on.
Â Â  Thank you Mrs Lulling.
(1)
Â Â  .
This word replaces 'authority'.
The rest remains unchanged.
Â Â  â Very well, MrÂ Katiforis.
Your proposal related therefore to Amendment No 8.
In any case, I shall be brief.
Â Â  â MrÂ Gollnisch, I had warned you.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
For these reasons, the report won my vote.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour, of course.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is time for us to act swiftly.
That is why the Kindermann report is so important.
Â Â  .
Hence my vote in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Deep-sea trawlers were accused of systematically destroying the corals.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am therefore voting in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
And:
Â Â  .
This explains our vote.
Â Â  .
We therefore abstained on this resolution.
âWhere are you running?â
I asked him.
Fatuzzo, you know MrÂ Mennea.
Â Â  .
We have therefore voted against this report.
This assumption is short-sighted.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of this resolution.
This ought to be a national concern.
Â Â  .
There are therefore two crucial issues:
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the voting.
(1)
Farmers have a right to decent incomes.
What are the possible solutions?
We must compare like with like.
However, farm household incomes are becoming increasingly diversified.
The concept of crisis management systems needs careful handling.
I have always supported the concept of decoupling.
Restructuring is taking place incredibly quickly.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Wachtmeister.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Comparative studies of that would be extraordinarily important.
Further development and research are inextricably linked.
What would happen if this unthinkable scenario became reality?
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Hyland.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Despite these amendments, the objective remains the same.
Thank you.
Fortunately, this unsatisfactory link was subsequently broken.
But the Council rejected much of that advice.
Something has to be done.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his report.
We all support sustainable fishing.
I am doing so today too.
That is something we should appreciate.
The deficiencies in scientific research are well known.
That is a scientific issue.
We really do need these measures.
I cannot, however, accept Amendment No 16.
Of course the fishermen should contribute their data.
However, I cannot accept Amendment No 21.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Why is this the case?
Budgetary planning is about linking resources to needs.
Nevertheless, the Commission is realistic, extremely realistic.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I wish to make three comments.
We need that flexibility in the budget.
I hope the Council takes cognisance of that fact.
My second comment is specifically to the Council.
Â Â  Mr President, we welcome the debate this afternoon.
Does this financial perspective address Turkey in any way?
Or will that be an additional expenditure?
Should you decide in December 2004 to start negotiations?
Â Â  Mr President, I plead for indulgence.
That is the percentage they want us to retain.
I think it shows a lack of ambition.
This year we will integrate ten new Member States.
Farewell cohesion!
Farewell solidarity!
I therefore remain unsatisfied, MrÂ Prodi.
Polite requests or punishment: you have a choice.
Furthermore, many problems remain outstanding.
Why is there not more funding for rural development?
My group welcomes this.
I look forward to hearing more about that.
Has the Commissioner ever heard of subsidy addiction?
One proposal meets with our approval.
That cannot be the right approach.
Both of these approaches are wrong.
Here is what we have to do.
We therefore need to talk about budget combinations.
All these issues will have to be discussed.
We will be looking at them.
A seven-year period could produce that situation.
Is this possible, based on your proposals?
I look forward to our discussions with you.
So is a high-level infrastructure.
Similarly, investment in the young is crucial.
Another problem and priority is Structural and Cohesion policy.
This is not the reason for my intervention.
Finally, just a few round figures.
Danish agriculture received agricultural subsidies of DKK 10 billion.
These are just two minor examples.
The second doubt concerns the timing.
So then, why the urgency?
I would like to conclude by raising two points.
Â Â  .
These, I repeat, are radical changes.
The timeframes are extremely long.
That would generate disappointment among citizens.
We have discussed this matter in considerable detail.
That is why we have put forward this proposal.
I wish you every success in your new position.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Yet the question is not exclusively about finance.
In December I asked a question on Croatia.
Nothing of the sort!
We will begin with questions to the Commission.
Â Â  .
Will restrictions on the options apply here as well?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for that answer.
But there is real confusion.
That is not coming through collectively.
Will the Commission provide information?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Heroin seizures have increased since 2001.
You can only set a lead.
Â Â  .
One concerns the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  .
Thank you for raising that question.
I too am extremely interested in this question.
This is a very important matter.
When do you intend to conduct these inspections?
You said that you would conduct them.
When do you intend to conduct them?
That is my answer to the question.
What will we do in that case?
I am obliged to tell you this.
It will not be finished by June or July.
Â Â  .
These are the directions in which we are moving.
That is why this dialogue is always positive.
Mr Ortuondo Larrea has a supplementary question.
Â Â  .
I personally participated in a number of those.
Mr Harbour has a supplementary question.
Â Â  .
It was very helpful and supportive.
Â Â  .
Thank you.
Â Â  .
We are concerned that the Agency may be ineffective.
That is the first answer.
I have already expressed my view in this House.
Â Â  We shall take the last question from Commissioner Liikanen.
This situation is unacceptable.
Information technology can be used to achieve that goal.
Â Â  .
We cannot go on like this.
It also builds on our work in mobile telephony.
Â Â  .
In technological terms the product is now ready.
The challenge now is to implement it appropriately.
But the first issue has been solved.
If so, why?
This review is not yet complete.
The need for further amendments cannot be ruled out.
The Commission considers this an important matter.
That is what we have done.
There is one notable exception: restitutions of churches.
This is an incredibly sensitive issue in Romania.
Do you know whether anything is being done?
Â Â  . Mr Posselt, I apologise.
I came prepared for questions on Romania.
We are talking about the European elections.
My question related to this particular case.
Please could you give a more detailed response?
They are.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for his statement.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Â Â  .
A line needs to be drawn under this episode.
The Baltic Sea has its own migratory salmon stock.
That, however, has not had much effect.
There have been continual disputes over salmon fishing rights.
Background levels have to be taken into account.
That is something that also has to be tackled.
He agreed to do so.
They should adopt protection methods to safeguard the consumer.
I am not interested in who did the study.
We must therefore not overlook this invaluable instrument.
Â Â  .
The American research is therefore seriously flawed.
It is crucial that these be better understood.
These are not very helpful.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The Commission presented a report with some proposals.
The Terni situation is symptomatic.
Â Â  .
The second point is European social law.
First, as regards direct subsidies to companies.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Thursday.
Will they grasp the challenge?
This is the reason I tabled this question.
Â Â  .
We have three categories of action.
So there is the serious question of disincentives.
The third is improving the quality of work.
These targets are being monitored by the Commission.
Europe faces an enormous challenge in this area.
I think this is another important point.
Europe has an increasingly smaller and older population.
You are Greek, Commissioner.
They are areas with low population densities.
Do you know what is happening?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
(1)
Â Â  .
It was approved in the 1980s.
Dealing with 30 000 terrorists is not easy.
The number was reduced to 160 in 2003.
Their recommendations are received with respect.
The demobilisation of vigilantes contributes to achieving this aim.
No negotiation can be allowed to strengthen the murderer.
Colombia is a social democracy.
Terrorism has increased poverty.
Building peace requires that we overcome that poverty.
We believe in social capitalism.
The London Declaration commits us deeply.
We need more cooperation in order to destroy drugs.
Without drugs there would be no terrorism.
It is time to destroy drugs.
They yearn for alternatives.
Each receives around 2 000 dollars per year.
We need to increase this to 50 000 families.
Deliberation is more constructive than absence.
Debate is more constructive than withdrawal.
Constructive polemic produces more than the abandonment of seats.
You are aware of my intransigence toward terrorism.
Â Â  .
The Accession Treaty also includes a safeguard clause.
Â Â  .
We have also made preparations for joint repatriation campaigns.
My second point is about combating corruption.
It will require investment.
You have our support on this.
That cannot be the way to go.
Otherwise, there is a danger of squandering resources.
Both output and method need improvement.
This shows an extraordinarily cavalier attitude to individual rights.
Let me remind you what he said.
But Europe also needs migrants'.
He fiercely criticised the EU's fortress Europe policy.
What can be done about it?
No country can defeat international terrorism on its own.
I should like to extend my congratulations to both.
The European arrest warrant is a case in point.
It is a topic that requires another extensive debate.
These matters should be considered on an individual basis.
Could Commissioner Vitorino elaborate on this?
The problem is what information are we to give?
How, though?
Not one word!
Yes, but about what?
CommissionerÂ Vitorino acknowledged as much.
I shall deal first with criminal judicial cooperation.
My comments are addressed mainly to the Council.
No delays should be countenanced.
I firmly believe these principles are valid.
A convincing response must be provided.
These opportunities are being reduced day by day.
You bet!
What, then, is the cure?
It is that the Commission should exercise special vigilance.
You have both referred to Tampere.
The guarantee of fundamental rights springs to mind.
Rather the opposite appears to have been the case.
Parliament has often been sidelined.
I refer to the fight against terrorism.
Sadly, terrorist incidents are becoming increasingly common.
I trust my suggestion will be taken up.
Allow me to mention a few examples.
The European arrest warrant is a prime example.
Lastly, I would like to refer to solidarity.
Europe is a common venture.
The area under debate is a common venture.
We are called on to move forward together.
Only then will we reap the benefits together.
Further, 1Â May is fast approaching.
The citizens of Europe certainly support such an approach.
They are constantly demanding more Europe.
Negotiation or ambiguity will not help to defeat terrorism.
Congratulations are also due to the Commissioner.
Greater cooperation is called for in this regard too.
There are, of course, many problems.
We certainly need to improve police cooperation still further.
We cannot ignore 11Â September 2001.
Terrorism really is an enormous headache for us.
An integrated and balanced approach was advocated.
It provides ample opportunity for exploitation in the workplace.
Handling charges for such remittances are outrageous.
In some cases, they amount to outright usury.
Â Â  .
This is one of the problems.
Terrorists are not afraid of a framework decision.
We must act to achieve these outcomes.
I mentioned this in committee last month.
Â Â  .
Mr President, that represents my view entirely.
The Tampere II agenda must be set in progress.
Â Â  .
It is not at all.
My third remark is about data protection.
My last remark is about the budget.
What will be the suggestions for that Tampere II?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
I already mentioned the Khan affair very briefly.
Libya is abandoning its nuclear weapons programme.
Iraq appeared not to have them.
Nuclear weapons make the world more insecure and dangerous.
This must be the goal of all of us.
Â Â  .
They enhance global and regional peace and security.
Not all Member States participate in the PSI.
Â Â  .
This regime established the basic norms for behaviour.
North Korea must return to conformity with the Treaty.
This amounts to a serious breach of international law.
Since then, nothing has happened.
The EU countries are not much better.
This is in the public interest.
How did Israel manage to develop an atom bomb?
Â Â  â The joint debate is closed.
The conference takes place today and tomorrow in Strasbourg.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
The amendment reads as follows in English:
What state has my amendment â¦
Â Â  Excuse me, I am sorry to interrupt you.
I will deal with it.
Now we come to the procedural question.
Are there any objections to the oral amendment?
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  Thank you Mr Fatuzzo.
Â Â  .
We therefore abstained.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  I thank you for that earthy contribution.
That really would be a good thing.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
I therefore voted in favour.
Let us hope that it happens soon!
Â Â  .
We have therefore voted against the ZappalÃ  report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The complaints are set to persist.
That is why I voted against Amendment No 155.
Â Â  â I travelled from Milan to Rome by car.
Look, one motor vehicle has turned over.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Both sides justify their positions with scientific advice.
This raises four important issues:
Â Â  .
However, I dispute your point.
Â Â  I had a dream, MrÂ President.
Great Britain is the leader here.
That is why we voted against the amended resolution.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
(1)
Â Â  .
The Israeli side showed some interest in these ideas.
This resolution was adopted on 8 December 2003.
But it must be a viable state.
Palestinians have to want peace and avoid terrorism.
The ambulance arrived much later.
The things that happen around this wall are intolerable.
Faced with general apathy we feel isolated and helpless.
Even the shops are on the other side.
Help us!â
The European Union cannot throw international law overboard.
This is not about opposing Israel.
That is the keystone of international law.
That is the key factor in this conflict.
That can be legally established.
That is, of course, completely unacceptable.
Reference has been made to the Berlin Wall.
I repeat: my compliments for saying something reasonable!
Palestinian communities would be effectively isolated from one another.
Recent proposed modifications will not prevent this.
What did we do?
That is something you can either support or oppose.
I think it is shameful.
What does that really mean?
Does the European Union know anything about this plan?
I do not share this view.
This is a hugely wasted opportunity.
Moreover, there are compelling humanitarian reasons to act.
These lopsided relations have the opposite effect politically speaking.
I wish to think well of both sides.
Everything out there is really provisional.
Do not forget that.
I think not.
He does not recognise the Green Line.
I hope that they will take the right decision.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â We are obliged to the Council.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Many sensible investors will pull out.
So this matters to all of us.
They will have brought it upon themselves.
To conclude, this is a very important debate.
We support the main lines of this resolution.
We are working, resolutely, in that sense.
There are three areas where we must act.
Good corporate governance is open, transparent corporate governance.
Such arrangements are untenable.
The culture surrounding corporate governance is important.
Furthermore, investors must insist upon good corporate governance.
This is no isolated case, however.
There is still the issue of compensation.
We looked at what happened and responded to it.
Nothing less.
They see they have been duped.
How many supposedly necessary redundancies could have been avoided?
Tax havens do not exist only in the Bahamas.
The simple fact is that there are criminals everywhere.
Unfortunately, bad people sometimes break laws.
They were already forbidden.
Unfortunately, they were all false.
There is only one way of preventing financial scandals.
This would reinforce the protection of creditors.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
How should we view this situation from our perspective?
That is a matter of taste.
We should recognise that.
Many speakers have mentioned regulation.
Regulation is the answer, but not over-regulation.
Â Â  .
Then there is the question of corporate governance.
It is therefore true that disclosure is key.
I agree.
It is not so easy to achieve global rules.
That is a very relevant question.
However, we can make it harder.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I take the point made by the Member.
We are very concerned about that.
We are very concerned that it should be minimised.
Â Â  .
This is particularly important in communities facing multiple disadvantages.
It will be a follow-up to a previous conference.
Â Â  .
That is very unusual in a Member State.
Poverty is very much a relative issue.
Individual pockets will inevitably occur.
Ten journalists, including Dawit Isaac, were imprisoned.
Â Â  .
I am aware of this case.
That is very welcome.
Â Â  .
I can well understand the concerns here.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mr President, that is a very interesting question.
Â Â  .
'Yes' is the obvious answer.
There is no substitute for African states taking ownership.
Â Â  QuestionÂ NoÂ 5 has been withdrawn.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you for that answer, President-in-Office.
Â Â  .
Unemployment gives rise to certain activities that are undesirable.
Â Â  .
I take note of his comment and his suggestions.
Â Â  Question No 7 has been withdrawn.
Â Â  .
The question anticipates something that will happen.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These are very timely questions.
That is a very ambitious timetable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Is the Council fully aware of this situation?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is a problem for economic progress.
Â Â  .
The aim is to provide a long-term perspective.
Will the Council take any action on this matter?
Â Â  .
Â Â  â Thank you MrÂ President.
These trials were condemned as show trials.
Further, human rights are being violated twice over.
Â Â  .
He is a good friend.
They are a universal concern.
I must support the answers given during previous presidencies.
Failure to do so would be construed as prejudice.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is well recognised in international law.
What have these people done, Mr President-in-Office?
Â Â  .
That is the issue.
That is where this matter lies.
There is a right to raise the matter there.
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time to the Council
see Minutes.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Commissionâs proposals are good ideas.
I beg to support that point.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Two or three words on two or three subjects.
Firstly, places of refuge.
It is located in Lisbon.
Firstly, marine pollution response.
Of course, I am slightly sceptical as well.
This would create difficulties for the Agency.
I would like to make one final comment.
Commissioner, please show ambition!
This is what we need!
Â Â  .
We are not ruling out any option.
It must be given a margin.
No, ladies and gentlemen.
Fifthly: when is the Agency going to move?
As soon as possible, ladies and gentlemen.
These are issues we are dealing with.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
This directive is therefore a first.
Nor does the directive affect the ISO norm.
We have simply set a framework for this process.
This directive is merely the start of the process.
Standardisation will therefore continue.
I believe this outcome has been achieved.
Their security must be guaranteed.
Overall, we are very satisfied with your proposal.
The rapporteur has chosen the right way to proceed.
There is a potential problem with Amendment No 17.
All of this depends on the market situation.
It should be used in practice though.
I think they were simply misunderstandings.
We are reliant on the industry here.
Â Â  .
This is all part of a whole.
A single measure does not get us very far.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
U.J
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Why?
The report put forward today is necessary and urgent.
Â Â  .
This is again a supplementary fund.
There is no such provision today.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(1)
((1)
Â Â  .
Building a secure Afghanistan will not be achieved overnight.
There will be no reconstruction without security.
What is the situation today?
We wanted 20%.
That was the first comment I wanted to make.
We must not allow this to happen.
Interim President Karzai should have every interest in this.
We shall have to make do with that.
I shall hand it to you later on.
Human Rights Watch reports many sexual assaults against children.
Commissioner Patten said that Afghanistan had reached a crossroads.
We must support them in this fight.
However, I am wondering about the following.
The same goes for the warlords.
Could you raise the issue of this law enforcement?
Their effect is devastating.
It spreads indecency and vulgarity.
Only one-third of school children are girls.
They are often held back from returning to school.
Many Members have talked about the issue of drugs.
The Americans are merely making a bad situation worse.
It was clear that security is the paramount issue.
The first concerns drugs.
The second point concerns the position of women.
The third point concerns freedom of religion.
The last point concerns the education system.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
It explains how further to involve civil society.
This is an innovation.
It is not the only one.
It was warmly welcomed by the Council.
I would just make two additional comments.
May I make a final comment?
To what extent is there transatlantic coordination?
Further deterioration in the region could have far-reaching consequences.
This contradiction could hardly be more mistaken.
Do you realise that or do you not?
How is such a thing possible?
Much remains to be done, however.
The situation in that region remains volatile.
We must continue to make an issue of this.
We note that it was published in 2003.
We welcome that.
This debate will continue.
We are far from it.
This list is unfortunately far from exhaustive.
Why is it important, Commissioner?
I believe that this merits a very solid follow-up.
It concerns the interplay between religion and politics.
Good accounts make good friends.
Our message must be clear.
Â Â  .
We welcome the United States' interest.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, Thursday.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
(1)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mr Mastorakisâ report deserves our wholehearted support.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I would like to express some reservations however.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Portugal has also suffered as a result of this.
Â Â  .
It is for these reasons that we have abstained.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
The Taliban regime was appalling.
Â Â  .
I welcome this report on the situation in Afghanistan.
Â Â  That concludes the voting.
Â Â  The sitting is resumed.
Are there any comments?
The notion of over-compensation would be greatly extended.
So here are my questions.
What is the Commissionâs timetable for action?
Â Â  .
A narrow majority perhaps, but still a majority.
The Commission should commit itself to this approach.
And the Commission considered and considered â¦
So much the better!
Now you are touting these ideas all over again.
I cannot conceive of any other reasons.
This is the legal clarity we want.
This is absolutely ridiculous, Commissioner.
You talked about confusion.
Where is the confusion?
Where is transparency?
Where is democracy?
You also talked about certainty, legal certainty.
That is the content.
Do not try to deceive us about the content.
You talk about exemptions.
So much for making things more certain.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Herzog.
The debate is closed.
This question has been put to Parliament by petitioners.
It is a legitimate question.
We have put it repeatedly to the Commission.
That is right, but only in part.
He has other responsibilities as well.
That is never the case.
What on earth does it have to hide?
It investigated the petitioners' complaints.
There cannot be a pick-and-choose system.
Yes or no?
Â Â  .
The Commission does not have those powers.
That seems to have been accepted in this House.
There is an interinstitutional framework agreement for parliamentary access.
Let me just refer to something Mr Perry said.
What does it have to hide?
I fail to understand that.
We must be consistent in the application of principle.
The Commission has met its obligations.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We share their view.
What is Commissioner Pattenâs opinion on this?
The outside world has never trusted the new authorities.
Their repressive actions are destabilising both State and society.
Public bitterness is already great and will only increase.
I think that this is spot on.
It is not a matter of reformers or non-reformers.
I am thinking here of the death penalty.
President Khatami will not resign.
The result is that complete hypocrisy reigns.
Â Â  .
Why?
Second, Iran is an enormously important regional player.
I will come back to that later.
That has taken a number of forms.
We had not had any discussions for a while.
Why are they trying to do that?
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Cambodia needs vigorous political leadership.
Public trust in politics has been seriously damaged.
Â Â  .
I strongly condemn that assassination.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Patten.
The joint debate is closed.
This situation is, without any doubt, tragic.
This is a terrible situation.
They must not be held hostage any longer.
There can therefore be no clear-cut apportionment of guilt.
Shortly?
That will have to be verified.
International law actually covers unresolved compensation issues.
I hope that Pakistan will soon do likewise.
Â Â  .
That is what the insurers have proposed.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
(1)
May I request that correction.
It is merely a matter of factual clarification.
(2)
These are technical rather than substantive amendments.
(3)
Â Â  Parliament has no further business.(1)
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
We therefore face quite a dangerous situation.
Â Â  I take note of that suggestion.
Nearly everybody clapped â for the speech at least.
Â Â  That is a very good point.
MrsÂ Schreyer will comment on this last point.
I will focus on the first issue I mentioned.
This is what makes the dialogue so vitally important.
This is what we are trying to do.
These, therefore, are our objectives.
The first is to guarantee continuity.
These are the priorities we propose.
The first is competitiveness and cohesion.
The second is security and European citizenship.
Reactivating growth should be the main political objective.
The second priority is security and European citizenship.
Issues of association and neighbouring countries are especially important.
Those are just a few examples.
I believe this is a very important occasion.
We understand the reasons for this delay.
I would like confirmation of this.
No further delay is acceptable.
We would have welcomed the Councilâs presence.
A 25 member Commission does not necessarily spell trouble.
The opposite is actually the case.
As I said, MrÂ Swoboda is absolutely right.
We need to restore growth.
We need enlargement to be successful.
We all hope and expect it will be.
That stands to reason.
They must never be sidelined or discriminated against.
The same situation applies to Iraq.
That is just too bad.
The latter is a much poorer country.
There certainly are some outstanding items.
Progress has been very uneven in this regard.
Some countries have forged ahead.
Others are still experiencing problems.
The European Union sorely needs these reforms.
That concludes the debate.
We oppose this project.
A different Europe is possible and necessary.
and
Â Â  .
The process of change is unavoidably difficult.
The prize is a great one.
The IrishÂ Presidency has just presented its priorities.
This is certainly a positive sign.
They can all be found in our report.
Greater investment in networks and research is called for.
So too is greater investment in development and innovation.
Private investors are directly affected.
Much remains to be done in this regard.
MrsÂ Randzio-Plath has been largely responsible for the latter.
The current guidelines cover the period 2003-2005.
Overall consistency has improved as a result.
It represents valuable and useful input.
The Commission is undertaking a review.
Our key challenge is to ensure effective economic governance.
Steady progress is being made at European level.
The impetus must come from the EuropeanÂ Council.
Â Â  .
My colleague MrÂ Solbes has referred to these points.
But what is actually happening?
These are not easy tasks by any means.
This report identifies several priority areas for action.
Can we stop now?
I do not think so.
And nobody is questioning that.
That is not enough.
We need to go further.
The same is true of trainees.
A formal proposal should be presented before the summer.
We must take steps to guarantee their sustainability.
We must reflect together on possible solutions.
These are the points I wished to emphasise.
There are many more things that could be said.
It is useful to go back to basic principles.
The Commissioner mentioned this.
This is certainly an important issue.
It implies agreement to apply the Community method.
This is absolutely crucial.
Opinions have changed.
It is now deemed necessary to strengthen economic union.
This can be translated into a corrective approach.
Readiness to correct is a sign of wisdom.
Another important aspect is involved.
Reform must therefore be based on these models.
The Commissioner mentioned it in passing.
I refer to setting the forthcoming financial perspective.
It is all becoming an issue of blind faith.
Europe is stuck in second gear.
We must not let the recovery fool us.
We know what needs doing.
This Spring Summit has to be about delivery.
The Lisbon Agenda gave us a decade to reform.
Five years on, too little has been done.
The hardest hit are women and young people.
These examples should give us food for thought.
I am not so sure.
I believe it has created numerous oligopolies.
This is an old chestnut.
Nothing has happened.
Â Â  You got quite a lot into three minutes there!
The zeal of the convert, no doubt.
Another major European country provides us with an example.
Is this how we want to grow economically?
How does Europe respond?
Europe is, however, choosing its own destiny.
The virtues of American flexibility are extolled to us.
But where is the cash?
The same applies to investments in infrastructure.
To that extent, results have not been forthcoming.
That is the last thing Europe needs.
It is no solution.
And why not?
But that is not all.
We will then perhaps obtain achievable objectives.
Every day we add new rigidity.
Fine!
Such a get-together rarely benefits our European economy.
And who will be footing the bill?
It must be a guarantee of high-quality public services.
This policy, this Stability Pact must be amended.
Unfortunately this is not possible.
I should like to present one example.
It is the Europe we are all striving for.
I see that as utterly false.
What the Commission states is wholly unacceptable.
I fear that the reverse might sometimes be true.
There is also the environment, of course.
Productivity ties everything together.
Nonetheless, I would caution against simplistic comparisons.
I believe this diagnosis remains valid.
These factors are all crucial, in my view.
All agree that it should be a sustainable strategy.
It also implies a certain level of environmental protection.
This led to further points raised during the debate.
I maintained this was not the case.
I believe sound finances are essential to long-term growth.
Experience has proved it to be a reasonable limit.
As I see it, the Treaty remains valid.
The fundamental concepts certainly do.
Nonetheless, improvements are called for in certain areas.
It is important not to focus on fiscal consolidation .
Last Novemberâs communication was along those lines.
We are certainly prepared to discuss and debate them.
I have one last remark to make.
This could mean improving current budgetary processes.
I feel the starting point is sound.
Â Â  .
That was a very interesting point.
Many Members spoke about the issue of regulation.
Â Â  We should like to thank the Council.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
And we must all work towards this goal.
Â Â  .
This has perhaps not been fully acknowledged.
The conclusion is that control must be improved.
A list of priority projects already exists.
Â Â  .
Â Â  This statement by the Council has been noted.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Parliamentâs warning call should be heeded.
What message are we sending out here?
Â Â  .
Ladies and gentlemen, these are not my words.
In the real world there are armed forces.
In the world of sport there are teams.
In the real world there are laws.
In the real world there are neutral parties.
In the world of sport we have referees.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Europarty support blurs democracy.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
We must take advantage of this situation.
Europe cannot afford to let nationalism and xenophobia grow.
Are the elderly really different to young people?
No, there must be some difference!
I have also been thinking about other matters.
I do not think so, MrÂ President.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
My group will certainly distance itself from that.
In addition, access to culture is important.
It is also the responsibility of families.
These issues are, of course, mutually dependent.
This is wrong and needs to be put right.
Europe has worked hard for a common heritage.
In 2001 we celebrated the European Year of Languages.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
This is a complicated matter.
That is also an important victory.
It is not a permanent exemption.
Time will, of course, tell, however.
We believed they were too high.
And I frankly do not believe in this.
The first is the legal basis.
I wish again to thank the rapporteur.
I am very pleased.
Â Â  â Mr President, I welcome the Commission proposal.
Can Commissioner Monti shed light on this?
An empty annex is of no interest to us.
Ireland has yet to ratify.
I understand that no further amendments have been tabled.
These include the pesticides dealt with in this directive.
This would be a very important step forward.
Â Â  .
On these grounds the Commission can accept the compromise.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
I can see two other Members arriving!
Â Â  .
Why was this mechanism adopted as temporary?
It therefore had to be temporary.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
(1)
This practical approach is reflected in the Commission communication.
This gives me, as rapporteur, real satisfaction.
I found your thoughts and contributions indispensable.
Â Â  .
I have to say that I regret that deeply.
Why?
We have to do something about that.
The Commission has held intensive discussions with Russia.
The war has become self-perpetuating.
That sounds all well and good.
Russia has huge environmental problems.
Our policy on Russia has failed badly.
The Union has not agreed to one of these.
This again will require cooperation, not boycotts.
We are nevertheless prepared to accept some amendments.
This situation has to be rectified.
Calm and patience are needed in relations with Russia.
But which Russia?
The Russia of the new parliamentary elections?
The elections to the Russian Duma have shown that.
I have a question for Mr Patten.
We all know why.
What happened in Europe 60 years was genocide.
What happened in Rwanda was genocide.
It is something far worse.
We see other things.
Nonetheless, we are considering lifting the arms embargo.
Russia is the EUâs most important neighbour.
These conditions have been met.
They cannot bear the burden of a divided world.
Moreover, the situation is getting worse.
Journalists are being murdered in Russia.
Many references have been made to Chechnya.
They are of strategic and political importance.
Europe can no longer be content with mere rhetoric.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Imprisoned Azerbaijani politicians have gone on hunger strike.
Finally, we have all been exposed to lobbying.
Â Â  .
I very much welcome that commitment.
Why is this such a cause for our concern?
Non-intervention is of course inadequate as a strategy.
Moscowâs objectives are precisely the opposite.
Many Members have already made reference to energy policy.
And what are we doing?
It is the question of separatism.
The right of peoples to self-determination is fundamental.
The president replied that he would accept Finnish sovereignty.
Why not take him at his word?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
(1)
(2)
This news thus has particular significance for us today.
We are deeply saddened by his tragic loss.
Â Â  We now continue with the vote.
Â Â  The services will ensure that all language versions correspond.
This was erroneously changed to the âpeopleâ.
That concludes the vote.
- Report: Daul (A5-0082/2004)
- Report: Randzio-Plath (A5-0056/2004)
- Recommendation: MacCormick (A5-0036/2004)
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  .
- Report: Frahm (A5-0017/2004)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted against the Frahm report.
A Parliament authorises or prohibits.
It does not produce (bad) literature.
- Nuclear disarmament (B5-0101/2004)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
- Report: Wallis (A5-0048/2004)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
- Spring Summit (B5-0102/2004)
Â Â  .
They are the ones who should be given priority.
- Report: Randzio-Plath (A5-0045/2004)
Â Â  .
Their performance so far is absolutely unacceptable.
I am therefore voting against this report.
In my view, the opposite has happened.
- Report: Bigliardo (A5-0044/2004)
That is wise.
This is why I voted against its adoption.
Â Â  .
- Report:
No, quite the opposite!
I accordingly voted in favour.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote(1).
Â Â  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
Â Â  (1).
One such area is regional cooperation.
We will become next-door neighbours.
The figures are impressive!
I am going to be a bit naughty here.
We are to debate the privatisation of water.
Nothing has been done.
Enlargement is constructive, necessary and incredibly important historically.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  The Minutes will be amended accordingly.
(1)
The following changes have been proposed:
Â Â  â Thank you Mr President.
It makes sense to hold over the vote.
The report was sent to that committee.
I will check whether due process has been followed.
This is an extremely serious matter.
The letter was addressed to MrsÂ Barbara Spinelli.
Â Â  I have taken a positive note of that request.
It is totally unacceptable.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
and
This proposal has already been submitted by the Convention.
Member Statesâ policies, however, lack coherence.
Â Â  .
What are we celebrating?
Women's rights are human rights.
We still have a long way to go.
I shall start by answering Mrs Karamanou.
We were both there.
The Commission can claim several successes in this area.
May I sit down, Mr President?
So please take a seat, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
Â Â  .
I will try to continue sitting down.
The second factor is working hours.
What is a family?
That, too, has to be defined.
There is justification for both of them.
They should be welcomed.
Gender equality and economic development go hand in hand.
I believe it is necessary.
This is hardly an example of equal opportunities â¦
I see this as resorting to clichÃ©s.
The fact is that poverty has a female face.
Our group shares the rapporteurâs concerns.
There is simply more to be done.
In reality, new problems arise all the time.
Paragraph 16 is crucial to our group.
That is scandalous beyond belief.
There is no question about that.
I should like to ask you a question.
The family is the smallest unit in the state.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I am a feminist.
The same thing must happen in the EU.
Women and men must be equal.
There are two main reasons for this.
We have the same rights and obligations.
The success must be operational and lasting.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I could give many other comparisons.
Even there, the rays of hope are multiplying.
Finlandâs?
Swedenâs?
This gives us grounds for hope.
Â Â  .
In conclusion, the Commission supports the proposed resolution.
We must coordinate our efforts.
First, a few facts.
Every minute, ten people are infected with HIV.
This is the concept that I suggest.
Financial commitments have not been met.
That is particularly important where ethical issues are concerned.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Here are just the most important.
The term 'partnership' should be officially registered.
In my view, this should simply be possible.
He said it is a question of simplifying formalities.
This common position may not be ideal.
There are aspects that are not perfect.
It considerably simplifies matters.
People have spoken about the issue of partnerships.
But we still face problems.
Mr Evans raised the issue of expulsions.
For us this too is problematic.
My Group can accept the common position.
We welcome certain amendments put forward by other Groups.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
It is very important.
However, it is a very complex area.
It is very important that we recognise regional differences.
We are looking at the harmonisation of criminal provisions.
I wonder what MrÂ Evans really meant.
That is unacceptable.
There is thus no threat to any national legislation.
Swedish legislation prohibits drug use.
It would amount to giving up.
The facts are inescapable.
Drug cartels in Colombia and Afghanistan are in contact.
Their citizens deserve it.
It talks about production and it talks about sales.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Coelho.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
This is not about creating a European border guard.
Why is this so?
In so doing, you evade your own responsibility.
The parliaments of the 25 Member States, perhaps?
This is severely disappointing.
Â Â  .
The Agency represents one step forwards towards communitarisation.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
We think they are important.
These are points I take very seriously.
Who decides that?
These cases are well-founded.
That is incompatible with the rule of law.
That is not the case.
I welcome this proposal.
It should be generally welcomed.
Â Â  Thank you for your comment.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Dehousse.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It defines tougher enforcement measures.
Will, knowledge and cooperation are required.
One such aspect is its scope.
Not all countries within the EU are exactly alike.
We must defend them and give them a chance.
Thank you very much for your fantastic cooperation.
Â Â  .
Animal welfare is also extremely important.
MrsÂ Paulsen mentioned labelling.
The same applies to the proposed financing procedure.
Those who tinker lose customers.
Food safety must not be a cover for protectionism.
The fees issue was also hotly contested.
Mr Goodwill said that these measures have unintended consequences.
The institutions have come together.
She deserves all our thanks.
Unfortunately, food controls are still a farce.
That is all we want.
Because what we need is food controls â¦
You cannot do that without proper and adequate controls.
Â Â  .
Mr President.
Mr Parish raised the question of import controls.
Mr Parish also raised the question of animal welfare.
Â Â  Thank you Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Counterfeiting and piracy are on the rise.
There is also a genuine threat to public order.
Time will not improve this text.
Time is of the essence.
Accordingly, an original procedure was used.
The discussions took three months.
The exception made for private copying is actually strengthened.
The protection of personal data is strengthened.
All measures taken must be justified and proportionate.
All measures envisaged are civil and administrative sanctions.
It will strengthen confidence in the internal market.
Â Â  .
I will explain.
Why was there this disparity?
What is the directive intended to achieve?
The directive provides a process-based framework here.
What should the directive not be allowed to do?
Far from a bargain.
Nor is it a panacea for rights holders.
The law has no criminal provisions.
It is restricted to civil and administrative remedies.
There are no double damages.
Why so?
I shall take toys as an example.
I have seen toys that contain cadmium.
Medicinal products are another example.
This is my first point on consumers.
They may be right.
Not everything can become industrial or intellectual property.
I am of course talking about artists.
Are artists happy to be equated with industrialists?
So much for the form.
We need a good directive.
Why all this?
This was a long task that lasted many months.
A final comment on Article 16.
We shall thus escape a second or third reading.
A balance has not been struck.
The issue of familial interests needs to be included.
I say that without any personal discourtesy.
This is not specifically about the digital world.
Approximately 20 000 jobs are lost each year.
Let us make additional improvements to the next directive.
Nevertheless, I shall be voting against the Directive.
Let there be no confusion.
Parliamentâs honour is at stake.
These rights ensure that creativity is adequately rewarded.
One of them relates to commercial purposes.
The definition has therefore been extended to both.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The European institutions have been criticised for being bureaucratic.
I do not like the word âbureaucraticâ.
We are looking at outcomes.
That is my suggestion.
We must wait for ten minutes.
Anything else would be absurd.
Â Â  We have a request then, an official request.
We have a speaker in favour of that request.
Does anyone wish to speak against the request?
It seems not.
Those against please?
Are there any abstentions?
Politics lies at the heart of the debate.
Hence, I have two questions for the Commission.
Tomorrow, you are invited to meet Israeli pacifists.
Let us consider the rules of origin.
Nevertheless, the question still remains.
This would be unacceptable.
It would amount to deliberately flouting international law.
Will the Commission undertake to do so?
My conclusion is a general one.
The situation today is totally different.
What type of cooperation can we be talking about?
That is not where the problem lies.
We must not share responsibility for this.
Â Â  .
That would certainly not help the peace process.
The figure is definitely under 5%.
The Israelis seem ready to accept this.
What will this lead to?
Now we are talking about something serious.
So then, let us avoid this.
It is destroying lives and livelihoods.
Â Â  An example of Italian , elegance and courtesy.
No answer came at that time.
What is the Commissionâs view on this?
Why ruin them?
Because there is a lot of falseness here.
That is how we need to view this dossier.
Â Â  .
Somebody asked where the customs duties go.
The EU's position is clear.
Â Â  Thank you very much, CommissionerÂ Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.(1)
Â Â  Mr Turco, I take note of your suggestion.
Â Â  .
I find this outrageous.
I hope the House will support my report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Mr President, the report's title is misleading.
Â Â  There is a separate vote on that amendment.
This is voting time, not a debate!
âParasitic copiesâ is therefore the correct wording.
Â Â  I take note of that.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
All the amendments I tabled in committee were adopted.
They seek to strengthen several aspects of the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Portugal is in exactly the same situation as Spain.
Â Â  .
That is why I voted for Amendment No 53.
All this shows that this is illegal.
The Bureau will be sitting in judgment upon itself.
Â Â  .
Does Parliament want to make a stand for democracy?
This is clearly not a convincing argument.
The allocation of Community subsidies depends on political loyalty.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Otherwise, the transparency of these decisions is compromised.
Â Â  .
I voted against.
Â Â  .
A number of votes were taken en bloc.
Mr Corbett, am I right on this point?
I will take the matter up bilaterally with her.
But that is not what happened.
Â Â  .
This situation must be stopped.
Â Â  .
The battle is far from being won.
These measures will bring significant benefits to consumers.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Turmes.
I will then be guided by its wisdom.
This is a problem that we must address.
Â Â  .
This, however, is the theory.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Instead, each country devises its own policy.
We say no.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Consequently, I voted against the report.
The Moderate family policy envisages highly flexible child care.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There are a variety of solutions.
Equality between men and women certainly requires that.
Â Â  .
There is still a need for ...
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted against.
Should we leave them to their own devices?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is what this third report has achieved.
The Commissionâs drafts are still basically bad.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Please excuse me.
Can the matter be corrected?
Â Â  That will be corrected.(1)
The detainees are in a legal vacuum.
That is the situation of the prisoners.
Â Â  .
I would even go one step further.
It raises issues of considerable importance.
Â Â  .
However, that status is unknown in international law.
In short, there is a legal void.
That is a basic principle underpinned by international law.
This case is deserving of this, and more.
We are committed to human rights.
They have the right to a fair trial.
They are the opposite.
What of their families?
What of their concerns?
What of their human rights?
The calls made in this House are not anti-American.
Mr Camre, I cannot agree with you.
Hence the actions that have been taken.
This is a historic challenge.
It is a dangerous signal in every respect.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Their agreement will not come as a surprise.
It is, in any case, striking.
The question is only when and under what conditions.
This process is jerking along.
It is not easy.
What is more important is the conditions.
I urge you to leave it at that.
The new instruments should not involve any new conditions.
This is, however, necessary.
So this is the right way to go.
Croatia has been on the right path for years.
Cooperation is good in all areas.
We should remember what has been achieved already.
That impression also applies to several other countries.
Our meeting with President Rugova was symbolic of this.
What, then, is at issue here?
The answer to it is âyesâ.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
I will be voting in favour.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
There is a place for that in this debate.
It is refusing to do so.
What is a good teacher?
I wish to concentrate mainly on the culture report.
Let me just make three key points.
Spending on cultural activity is important.
There are 40 million minority-language speakers now.
Six million other people speaking minority languages will join.
It cannot be any other way.
In the end this will benefit all Europeans.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs Zabell.
The debate is closed.
Voting will take place tomorrow at noon.
5Â p
It is done.
Europe has a soul.
They have not been plucked out of thin air.
I said there were two programmes.
A few figures will illustrate what we propose.
Then there are our Jean Monnet Chairs.
Today we have them in 50 countries.
So much for the big new integrated Education programme.
The first field is the Youth Programme.
The second field is culture.
The final field is the audiovisual sector.
Upstream by acquiring competences.
Our cinema schools must be networked.
That would be a very good thing.
Downstream there is the problem of distribution.
DVDs already have the potential to be multilingual.
It is of course a framework.
What are the facts of the matter here?
Thirdly, are the programmesâ titles being lost?
It is not clear to me from the text.
Please accept my apologies.
Over what period?
On what basis?
What news!
We are starting with such a small amount.
My second question concerns languages.
My third question concerns the cinema.
My fourth question is a point of application.
You spoke about Bruges and Florence.
Let us hope that we succeed in doing that.
Let me now turn to the new programme.
That must not be allowed to happen.
We need to be very clear.
That is clear.
Clearly, Europe cannot be built without linguistic diversity.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Two big obstacles lie ahead of you.
There is a problem of mutual recognition versus standardisation.
Â Â  .
That is not the position of the Commission.
We now discover that they are not going to.
Â Â  .
I therefore believe there is no doubt about this.
We call for transparency and an adjusted quota.
The fact is that they simply are not there.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for your explanations.
That much is abundantly clear.
Â Â  I am grateful for that answer, Commissioner.
Could you comment on that specific point, Commissioner?
That is the problem facing us.
These sweeteners are also in direct competition with sugar.
That is what we have to reckon with.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Different parts of Europe are facing different problems.
Â Â  I wanted to thank Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for her reply.
We take these matters extremely seriously.
Â Â  .
This is definitely part of our approach.
It will focus on children.
We will also use legal instruments, etc.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
If not, why not?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is Question Time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We do not accept all types of trophy hunting.
I also welcome nice comments from Members of Parliament!
It is horrific!
We should have got past this stage.
It is ridiculous.
I agree with Mr Evans about CITES-listed species.
There should be a ban on them.
It is not acceptable.
We should get our priorities right.
Let people in, not these trophies.
Â Â  .
We have to pursue the culprits in this area.
We must implement the rules that are in place.
These correspond to the CITES listing as well.
That concludes Question Time to the Commission.
Â Â  .
An important aspect of the proposed directive concerns monitoring.
This is the basic requirement.
The study likewise confirms the feasibility of limit values.
There is no mechanism yet within Parliament for this.
That is a technical assessment.
But I do not see that as a solution.
These substances do not belong in the ambient air.
The Commission has opted only to monitor pollution.
This is a noble pursuit, in my view.
The risk to health is obvious.
Take for example nickel.
I would urge him to think again.
Limit values are needed, for example for arsenic.
This is a real problem in my country.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Our proposals fulfil all these aims and conditions.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Fischler.
The whole of the negotiation process is interdependent.
The European agricultural model must be supported.
Follow their example, Commissioner!
I would add that this substantial increase is expected.
I shall return to this point later.
Your final objective is actually complete decoupling.
The Commission seems to be fully aware of this.
MrÂ Berlato mentioned them earlier.
I fully agree with the view he put forward.
Nonetheless, Commissioner, you have proposed total decoupling.
The livelihoods of the tobacco producers are at stake.
So too are thousands of related jobs.
Each of them agreed to compromise on something.
Â Â  .
I have examined other Memberâs amendments.
There is no link, though.
Poverty is actively created in that way.
I would urge the Commission to persevere.
Decoupling aid will result in reduced production.
That much is clear.
This will fuel speculation.
The risks involved are abundantly clear, however.
Even the Commission itself has recognised them.
It also stimulated economic activity in depressed areas.
Why should it be abandoned?
Surely similar arrangements for olive oil could be considered?
I trust the House will support them.
This is about to become a burning issue.
Advisedly, it must inform and prohibit.
To South-East Asia?
It is the right direction and we support it.
Surpluses are certainly not a problem for this sector.
Such data is now available.
Opposing viewpoints had to be reconciled.
I believe this is a valuable compromise.
CETARSA was a profitable public company.
I shall focus on olive oil.
Olive oil production is no exception.
It ensures that the population stays on the land.
Decoupling could provide a further incentive.
This is an unacceptable position.
They therefore deserve fair treatment from the Commission.
That is a difference of almost 500%.
There is another paradox involved too.
The situation beggars belief.
We believe the situation has to change.
I can provide some specific instances drawn from Spain.
They would all have to be scrapped.
It is the leading producer of tobacco in Spain.
It is a problem.
The fight against cancer really is an untenable reason.
This is part of the agricultural reform.
The other problem is the approval of society.
Â Â  .
Now a few remarks on the Lavarra report.
And so to cotton.
That is the issue here.
Amendment No 66 proposes a buy-back programme.
Let me turn, finally, to hops.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
Consultations and contacts are ongoing.
However, I would offer the following observations.
I can say this, however.
The issues have been debated intensively and extensively.
Minister Roche's report is clear.
Obviously, on some points, improvement is possible.
That also reflects practicality and proportionality.
That work must not be in vain.
For the weak, unattainable.
For the meek, unknown.
But for the brave, opportunity.
I believe that Parliament should express its opinion clearly.
Without institutional reform this Union cannot function effectively.
For an enlarged Europe, Nice death.
Do we insist on integration where it is needed?
How far have we got?
Then come the facts in all their brutality.
Those are the words of the Commission.
At the present time we have two main problems.
The Convention had aims.
That is their one and only goal.
Five months!
Mr President, thank you for your patience.
Is the Presidency fully informed?
What issues?
Raised by whom?
By how many and which governments?
We do not know.
We can only try to guess at these.
We should also drop the principle of equal rotation.
Today, however, Europe instils fear in people.
There has been no further news of them.
These Geneva Conventions should be observed, Mr President.
Danger ahead!â
What does the Commission stand for?
What have we achieved here in Parliament?
We have made little progress on democracy.
There can be no democracy without transparency.
The real tragedy is that friction has been generated.
This will not help Europe to move forward.
I can only recommend vigilance.
What do they ask us about?
What does it do?
How is it run and by whom?
It gives Europeâs citizens more power.
I wish the Irish presidency every success.
This proposal is designed to de-industrialise the European Union.
The Commission must be in no doubt about that.
The same applies to advertising restrictions.
I could name many other directives too.
Then we shall achieve growth and employment throughout Europe.
The summit must not degenerate into a talking shop.
That is our message to the Irish presidency.
EU competitiveness will not improve with laws like these.
On the contrary, it will become seriously endangered.
New magic remedies are not required.
I shall begin with the Lisbon Strategy.
He is right.
Again, they are right.
That is a very significant poll.
I fully understand Members' frustration.
Mr Brok was also correct.
Let me turn specifically to some of the matters.
That is true.
I would reiterate that point.
Â Â  . â Mr President.
There can never have been a more devout aspiration.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
and
Â Â  .
Legal uncertainty invariably acts as a barrier to investment.
Â Â  .
The turnaround is truly remarkable.
My report is therefore very optimistic.
The macro-economic indicators have been very positive in Bulgaria.
Confidence is a key factor.
And we have also guaranteed this'.
I do not think the amendments are necessary.
Â Â  .
Honesty has not only a commercial value.
The situation has changed, however.
This is not so.
The European people have the final say.
I wish to congratulate the Commission.
The Union as a whole stands to benefit.
There is still time.
Yes, this enlargement will create problems.
This enlargement will force us to make adjustments.
There was no sensible alternative, however.
We had to do it.
Our system is obviously very complicated.
We are making preparations.
I have done everything the UN has asked.
For us, these conditions are absolutely essential.
Romania can also count on our assistance and solidarity.
Baroness Nicholson raised the subject of adoption.
This difference is crucial.
It is an occasion for joy.
I believe we will do it, however.
Tremendous challenges remain in the area of internal security.
Of course we must secure the external borders.
One final remark.
I will not go into that now.
We will meet and discuss this matter again.
We must not relax our drive against corruption.
Corruption undermines economic progress.
The two things are closely related.
We completely condemn these articles.
Together we can strengthen Europe.
That is something I deeply regret.
We need constantly to monitor the situation.
There are still many problems left unsolved.
Another problem is Cyprus.
Â Â  The debate is suspended.
It will continue at 3 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  We shall make sure that the text is corrected.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
I therefore voted in favour.
We therefore support the decision reached in the Council.
Â Â  .
To be specific:
This already applies to pensioners and students.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The report before us dovetails with the Prets report.
The budget available to the programme has been increased.
Â Â  .
What is the reasoning behind this hastily cobbled-together policy?
I would like to focus my remarks on tobacco.
I believe the Commission's reform package is fair.
We therefore support the Commission proposal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This proposal particularly affects Portugal.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
This is why I voted for the Daul report.
We therefore support the Commission proposal.
Â Â  .
I naturally welcome these amendments.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .â I am voting for this report.
We hope the results will meet their expectations.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
(1)
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
That is not its purpose, however.
I can say the same about agricultural policy.
That was not my aim.
Â Â  .
The two months left are little time.
What do we need to do?
We need to support this effort.
It is true that we have to accept that.
Congratulations and welcome, therefore, to Slovenia.
Â Â  .
Needless to say, that is not the case.
At present, human resources are still deployed insufficiently.
Another point is health and safety at work.
This amounts to a simply outstanding achievement.
Social security should be developed more effectively.
This is a fantastic achievement by these people.
We need a policy for all the countries.
The Commission must participate rather than just making demands.
It must also stimulate and make resources available.
This House is taking this problem seriously.
Romania must resolve this issue prior to accession.
Â Â  .
Rigour is of course needed, but not prejudice.
That we have learnt from our history.
There are political and commercial problems regarding both.
Internally we are divided to an unusual degree.
They are far from achieving this.
This is why I will vote against the report.
I would like to highlight two issues.
I regret that Commissioner Verheugen did not acknowledge this.
In Europe, protecting minorities is not optional.
Finally, the resolution before us contains blatant contradictions.
But problems remain.
All this is by way of general comment.
That really is an old way of thinking.
The revolution was not a complete success.
I think that is happening.
I would encourage full attention in that regard.
Mr Poos, in particular, touched on this.
I welcome those particular contributions.
At best, this is tabloid hysteria.
That is hardly a flood!
In conclusion, I wish to thank the Members.
It has been a very thought-provoking and thorough debate.
Â Â  That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
This is not correct.
The reality is in fact the opposite.
Â Â  .
So what are the principal objectives of this proposal?
Â Â  .
Europe needs improved transport links now.
In conclusion, the TENs programme deserves implementation.
I commend this report to the House.
Using them to extend it is not acceptable.
Codecision is at issue here.
Both sides have to give way.
I think that they are spatial planning tools.
They are transport policy tools.
Only projects that pass this test can be supported.
The projects we are planning are long-term ones.
We will vote in accordance with these considerations.
We cannot find a solution.
Parliamentâs proposals are not nit-picking amendments.
In general, parliaments propose additional and supplementary features.
A whole railway would be required.
Because we cannot do anything against their will.
Slovenia says that it has difficulties accepting it.
Other amendments propose routes in third countries.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
It is not on the agenda.
Please restrict yourself to speaking as a questioner.
Â Â  Please follow the Presidencyâs instructions.
You say they are not sanctions.
I would like to find another word.
Â Â  . â The words I used were very specific.
They are happening on a daily basis.
The Council remains very much open to political dialogue.
Political responsibility therefore falls to the Council.
Action is indeed needed.
Â Â  I agree with Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and Mr Cappato.
That is a responsibility for the Council.
It is not, as the Member well knows.
There has not.
Â Â  . â This is a very serious matter.
They are very welcome measures.
Â Â  . â I understand the Member's concerns.
This is a particularly pernicious and dreadful trade.
I hope that this answers the Member's question.
It is the 21st century equivalent of slavery.
It is adopting a holistic approach.
We are taking a holistic approach.
I agree with Mr Evans.
My question relates to the following.
Â Â  . â I should like to thank MrsÂ Morgantini.
Mrs Morgantini's specific question referred to the impact.
Suicide bombings play no legitimate part in any agenda.
Separating people never works.
I thank the Member for the question.
I have followed the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  I know that.
Â Â  They belong to different groups.
Â Â  I am sorry, Mr Beazley.
Â Â  .
I thank the President-in-Office for his answer.
I would also like to ask a supplementary question.
Â Â  . â â thank you very much Brian.
I agree wholeheartedly with the opening point.
That has not happened.
He is correct in that.
The Irish Government welcomes that.
The Breton language exists in Brittany.
However, I take the point that you made.
We have already had the example of 11 September.
These reports, and their implications, are terrifying.
That concludes Question Time to the Council.
(2)
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
and
Â Â  .
Mr President, let me melodramatically apologise in advance.
The original draft was a little too open-ended.
I am very pleased the Council has adopted that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have come a long way towards achieving this.
It also accepted the definition of a passenger.
State aircraft have been exempted.
But there still remain areas of difference between us.
I believe the amendment covers an adequate compromise.
We can then go forward into the future.
I would add one word of caution.
I look forward to the future.
This is now a very good report.
The amounts involved represent a fair compromise.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  .
It supports the work of the Competitiveness Council.
There is also the consultation with our social partners.
These are the good bits in this report.
Unfortunately they are only the icing on the cake.
That is where this report goes wrong.
What does it mean by structural reform?
That is not what I am about.
I have looked at this report.
This is not what Europe is about.
We have had liberalisation of certain industries in Europe.
We have talked about the Lisbon agenda.
That never gets mentioned these days.
Instead, it is market, market, market.
It is not only about profit for major companies.
I hope that we will remove that tomorrow.
Our citizens do not want a liberalised water sector.
Europe has a soul.
We cannot let down our citizens.
Â Â  .
I am here wearing two hats.
That is going to give us an important perspective.
In conclusion, this is an excellent report.
Thank you for this report.
Â Â  .
This does not strike me as being unreasonable.
There is much more to come!
We shall certainly pursue this line of thinking.
I hope the directive on services makes swift progress.
This can only cause ill-feeling and disputes.
Railtrack by sea!
I hope Sir Neil would agree to that.
Further market opening is desirable.
This debate is not about deregulation but re-regulation.
Competition is the consumer's best friend.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Bolkestein offers to visit Skye.
He is very wise!
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  . â This report is of enormous importance.
Just four topics.
For whom?
Serving what kind of economy?
A speculative one?!
They need different rules.
The economic impact on consumers would be negligible.
I should like to emphasise this.
We have made some amendments since the last reading.
This includes newspapers, weeklies and other parcels.
I hope that these compromises are sufficient.
The industry approves.
Rather, the opposite is the case.
They are the big losers.
This is what our amendments are aiming at.
Each Community acquis is fiercely defended.
Those who would not benefit are consumers.
They would very quickly face increases in postal prices.
We want to defend consumers.
But then what happens to the public service obligation?
They are taxable in all other cases.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Sadly, this agreement cannot be straightforward.
That is certainly not the intention.
There may be cause for action elsewhere.
We have great reservations.
We want Palestinian participation without barriers or handicaps.
We want a very close monitoring of the situation.
I frankly doubt that this would be the case.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.
Â Â  .
I commend the report to you.
That would allow for swift adoption by the Council.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.
(1)
With each report the casualty list is growing.
No more bombs.
No more deaths.
Â Â  .
Madam President, thank you very much.
What is the Commission's position on the amendments?
What is the meaning of this updating?
This oral amendment should enable us to move forward.
Fighting terrorism is an extremely difficult business.
That is what makes this report so responsible.
Therefore, it will provide benefits for some people.
That is not part of this discussion.
I turn now to the document submitted to us.
All countries have benefits of this type.
The key date will be 1Â May 2004.
That is extremely depressing.
I believe that this can be avoided.
On the contrary.
No one will be discriminated against.
The Netherlands is therefore saving that money.
Cross-border work is very important in my region.
We are not in an election campaign here.
That is clearly an omission in the report.
It is 'contributory pension' in some countries.
It will then be called Annex X instead.
That is my personal view.
Family benefits definitely do not have their place there.
I therefore reject MrÂ Schmidtâs proposal.
Â Â  .
It is a real problem.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, MrsÂ Lynne.
Things can get worse still.
This is food for thought.
The national governments will then blame Europe.
I am really looking forward to this.
It is a very comprehensive report.
That is something I do not deny.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur.
Older adults can often have multiple medical problems.
Hence the proposals that we tabled.
Both aspects should be considered objectively.
Â Â  .
I would like to make just two comments.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Let us have the names out in the open.
Â Â  You are absolutely right, Mr Karas.
It is all just rumour and scaremongering.
Â Â  I will not draw any conclusions at the moment.
There will be a full enquiry.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
The delegation is chaired by Mr Erkin Vakhidov.
We are very pleased to welcome you here.
Â Â  We now continue with the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I am sorry, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
(1)
Obviously emotions are running very high today.
I believe this suggestion makes sense.
We can reflect and work on it later on.
We have plenty of time.
It is only a recommendation.
Â Â  .
I believe that will meet all Members' concerns.
Â Â  .
Paragraph 33 is poor.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
I take it that you are not very happy.
This is just one more â¦
I voted for it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted for the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The damage, though, has been done.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I wish to record my opposition to this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Nor have many others.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Their peoples have every cause for concern.
There is no obvious need for coordination.
That is all well and good.
Â Â  .
I disagree with them very strongly.
Â Â  .
I shall therefore vote in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This was in 1997 and 1998.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I shall therefore vote in favour.
The rule of law does not yet exist.
Levels of corruption are alarmingly high.
The judiciary does not operate independently.
Media freedom is not safeguarded.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Sovereignty must be safeguarded.
I am therefore in favour of the Miller report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have therefore chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote(2).
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Ford.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on Haiti.
Â Â  .
Now it has imploded again.
Children are at risk from hunger and disease.
What can be done?
Do we follow in the wake of UN resolutions?
Do we contribute to the cost of peacekeeping?
We need to do all these things.
We need to release the frozen EDF monies.
This is quite unacceptable, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
I would just like to mention two additional elements.
The vote will take place after the debate.
Â Â  .
It is good that the matter is making progress.
Alternative technologies should therefore be developed.
Immediate damage is being done to these species.
Â Â  .
Certainly pressure on the opposition media is commonplace.
The choice is Ukraine's to make.
The situation reflects this.
For Ukraine to develop will take some time.
Let us remember these events.
Â Â  .
This represents a step forward.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The joint debate is closed.
Other procedures could have been used.
I believe that the resolution is very clear.
We are not trying to inflame passions.
Quite the opposite.
We are appealing for calm.
A new attack is unfolding at this time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The joint debate is closed.
There is absolutely no justification for inertia and indecision.
It is time to translate our resolutions into actions.
No!
The EU common position on Burma must be strengthened.
Â Â  .
High-level governmental visits have also been suspended.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The joint debate is closed.
(1)
(2)
Â Â  Parliament has completed its agenda.(1)
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(1)
Â Â  â Thank you, Mrs Banotti.(1)
I deplore this decision by our House.
You have indeed raised this matter before.
Â Â  â I see that Commissioner Bolkestein is here.
Â Â  â I can do that.
The policemen also removed copies of private accounts.
Â Â  â The next item is a joint debate on:
and
There are some issues which ought to be underlined.
That is clear.
We will be pressing this cause very much.
They need to change what is going on.
We believe that quarterly reporting is dead.
I will be voting for the presidency package.
I would urge other Members to do the same.
To that extent, ISD-2 is a missed opportunity.
This is also in keeping with the Lisbon process.
Will the conditions for competition be fair?
Are the conditions of general interest well established?
This appears unlikely.
I will, nonetheless, state some reservations.
I believe that this is a mistake.
I have made three proposals to that effect.
I am reasonably satisfied with the ISD Directive.
Congratulations to Mr Skinner!
I think it would be utterly impossible.
Competition will, therefore, encourage innovation and efficiency.
Mrs van den Berg mentioned two points.
A reasonable compromise has been found.
Â Â  â Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
After all, what is happening?
The Patriot Act also plays a part in this.
We tackle this against a rather sombre backdrop.
It certainly does nothing either for future EU-US cooperation.
Credible interlocutors deliver results.
That is the first choice.
But what shall we do?
Shall we go back to the beginning?
Shall we wait another year?
Let us be realistic.
How could he get justice?
The concerns about this agreement are widespread.
We urge our Member States to act more effectively.
What happens to them?
So we shall support the report.
You have not dealt with this.
This is no way to build an antiterrorist Europe!
That perseverance will yet come in useful.
The present agreement offers EU citizens insufficient guarantees.
I agree with everything she said.
It was extremely arrogant, to say the least.
Last March Parliament asked the Commission to do this.
I do not believe that is justified.
This is not the way to fight terrorism.
This is not the approach that should be taken.
Civil liberties have to be upheld.
They do not work.
The Patriot Act and other measures do not work.
Failing that, I appeal for more calm.
Finally, I wish to point out the following.
It is an extremely unsatisfactory situation we are in.
Commissioner Bolkestein has just shown this through his speech.
That is perfectly true.
Mr Pirker also remarked on that.
The fight against terrorism is a global one.
Mr Cappato also criticised the non-application of the law.
Â Â  â Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
The second major area is that of agriculture.
We call for OLAF to get involved in this.
The clear apportionment of responsibility has been central.
This explains the current high volume exported to Lebanon.
The improvements and reforms at OLAF are among them.
Very recently, has described this as exemplary.
Administrative reform is largely complete.
It could be said that fraud is continuing regardless.
These are the important questions that require answers.
An explanation really is needed.
Please answer this question here and now.
The problems have even increased in the last year.
The problem does not only relate to control systems.
It is also about system errors.
Export refunds should be abolished.
What was their final destination?
In general, export refunds are completely unjustifiable.
Commissioner, you should ensure that investigation takes place.
Irregularities are taken to mean infringements of European regulations.
I will reiterate that point.
That was our mistake in the past.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Women play many and various roles in many societies.
They have been an inspiration to each other.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Commissioner Dimas has the floor.
I see that MrÂ Hughes is not here today.
We have set out in pursuit of two objectives.
This affects many people in the labour market.
I am convinced it will be.
What we have before us is a compromise package.
I commend this report to the House.
There is no doubt about that.
Â Â  Thank you very much Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
You have this proposal before you.
The opponents are fighting a rearguard action.
I can understand the concerns of the insurance industry.
Understandably, industry never likes uncertainty.
Their conception of fairness was obvious.
Equality is a fundamental principle in the EU.
This is all too true.
It is lifestyle that is crucial to life expectancy.
That has not always been the case.
I refer to Amendments Nos 9 and 13.
I refer to Amendments Nos 38 and 39.
Â Â  By all means, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.

Governments come and go but the rural tribunals stay.
Â Â  .
The European Union has delivered on this commitment.
These new agreements are ambitious.
There are many questions we should ask ourselves.
How can we measure progress in regional integration?
The Commission has always supported regional integration.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That decalogue focuses fundamentally on three areas.
Â Â  .
Two very different approaches.
I would mention Columbia as a case in point.
It is imperative that three points are raised.
That is what we are all saying.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
What is it all about?
I believe they do.
I believe we have created an excellent legal base.
The effects may be described as follows:
Firstly, there is greater legal certainty.
We have found a more or less acceptable arrangement.
Legal certainty must be the main concern.
I believe we have that, too.
Everyone concerned is brought into the system.
I believe this is right.
There are a number of reasons for this.
There remains the question of costs.
Does the operator really save inspection costs?
I do not believe so.
All the calculations show the opposite.
They are an important foundation for food safety.
Â Â  .
In summary, we are pursuing four objectives.
A compromise requires that all parties make concessions.
The Commission believes this is appropriate.
Subsidiarity is the guiding principle here.
The Commission cannot support amendments falling outside this package.
It would be practicable then.
That is not a credible working method.
How did we get into this situation?
What is it all about?
What is crucial is who monitors the food producers.
I have a different opinion personally.
It has been tough.
There is no doubt about that.
I wish to thank him for his cooperation.
We shall support the compromise, if not wholeheartedly.
I am concerned about the cutting plants.
Thank you for your cooperation.
We do not want this point accepted.
There are three considerations I should like to make.
I cannot support that.
We have got to protect public health.
I am also addressing Mr Bowe when saying this.
What is it about?
The devil is in the details.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Animal welfare is an emotive subject.
Â Â  .
They can see it coming in the future.
The Environment Committee is strongly of that opinion.
I thank Mr Maat very much for that.
I very much recommend the report to the House.
What a wonderful achievement for the welfare of animals!
Animal welfare has nothing to do with it.
This must be stopped.
There is no question of an EU tax.
Dignified transportation affects both equally.
I cannot support that view.
The reality is different.
The merger trend in the slaughtering industry is continuing.
The distances over which animals are transported are growing.
This report ought to be promoting regional business cycles.
Transport times of 90 hours are not uncommon.
That is cruel.
Transport times must be reduced in any case.
The vote has been brought forward to today.
I consider that unacceptable.
That is probably pie in the sky.
Animal welfare must be ensured during transport.
This is an important issue.
We have nevertheless seen horrendous instances of problems occurring.
Animal transport is nevertheless handled excellently.
This is a mistaken point of departure.
That applies not only to journey times.
This practice is completely indefensible.
Budgetary control is very deficient in this area.
Let me underline a few of them.
What does âspecialâ mean?
That was also something that Commissioner Byrne mentioned.
One last thing.
However, that is no way near enough.
Inevitably horrific practices will continue to occur.
Refrigeration permits this.
Animal transport is central to Ireland's agricultural economy.
This should stop.
The hauling of animals should stop.
Let us seize this opportunity with both hands.
What do we want?
Why increase spaces?
In order to increase costs?
Whom does this benefit?
What is the justification?
Everyone who is not a vegetarian must acknowledge that.
No, it is not.
I believe that needs to be said.
Nine hours is about right.
But let us start somewhere!
That is the reality of this.
We should be limiting export on the hoof.
I want to thank Mrs Schierhuber.
I would like to say something to Mr Adam.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
This is a very complex and important report.
Â Â  Thirty-two Members support Mr Evans' proposal.
Does anyone wish to speak against it?
In that respect, the debate is finished.
â That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Unfortunately, difficulties remain in negotiations with other countries.
We must, however, go further.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Why does this need to be emphasised?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I could only vote in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
I welcome the flexibility provided for in the derogations.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The rapporteur could not have made herself clearer.
Â Â  .
- preventive measures must be established to reduce risk.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
â awareness-raising activities and dissemination of information,
Â Â  .
The following will thus receive support:
Part 1 â the European Womenâs Lobby;
Part 3 â any specific actions.
This is something that we regret.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I fully support the objectives of this regulation.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of these recommendations.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are not satisfied with the report before us.
Â Â  .
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The quality of transport conditions is vital.
Certified hauliers must be given this option.
Of course, all that smacks of fraud.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote(1).
(2)
Â Â  .
We are not strangers to each other.
Resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict is a strategic priority.
Â Â  .
Why is the human development gap still so great?
It is despicable and it is cowardly.
And what are the circumstances?
There are many things we have to do internally.
That is true.
They could have arrested him and tried him.
We need no more initiatives.
It was contrary to international law.
Yassin had odious crimes on his conscience.
In all respects, he was a loathsome terrorist.
Nonetheless, we cannot accept this type of killing.
Walls can never be the solution.
I believe we should assess the matter objectively.
Not with arrogance and imperialism, however, please!
He would crush them in a sandwich.
That is what is so terrible.
Why not back our words with action?
Why does the Council not listen to Parliament?
Why all these words?
Why no action?
Why is action not taken against Israel?
Europe must put forward a genuine and specific proposal.
I believe that everything else is just idle chitchat.
Politically, we do nothing, however.
This debate is outdated.
The United States does not make this choice.
Many Americans are also saying that it is wrong.
We do that with Israel.
It is a democracy.
Otherwise, we will never find a solution.
Will we simply let this happen?
This violence was continuously breeding more violence.
The EU could begin by suspending the trade agreements.
Â Â  Mr President, I have two points.
Do we mourn this man?
This plan is, indeed, disputed and disputable.
Finally, what does this plan advocate?
The fight against terrorism?
Has not this been the case since 1990-1991?
Resolution of the conflict?
Lastly, democratic reforms?
Civil society must be involved.
The Irish Foreign Minister spoke about the Arab-Israeli conflict.
My question is, what can do?
Is that really all we can manage to do?
Peace and stability are entirely in its interest.
The women were from 22 different Arab countries.
Where is the balance?
A particular peculiarity distinguishes the shape of our policy.
Yes!
What are we doing now?
Quite clearly we have to take initiatives.
Politics are not neutral.
Politics mean initiative, pro-action, proposals and results.
No terrorist acts can be approved.
It must be condemned.
The EU must not accept this.
Agreements must be complied with by both parties.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I will be very brief.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Commissioner Patten accompanied him on the visit.
They took with them a clear message.
Welcome as they are, words are not enough.
Â Â  .
There was precious little sign of it.
There was one exception to this.
That would be completely unacceptable.
What are the priorities now?
That is completely unacceptable.
Final status discussions are for another day.
That would risk a grave worsening of tension.
I naively believed that everything would then improve.
It is clear who was behind it.
I believe the ordinary Albanian people know, too.
Everything is now in ruins.
That is why not enough has been done here.
We need to think about that.
It should be âStandards and Statusâ.
We will not help things here with fine words.
I still do not see that happening.
Let us remind ourselves.
The tragedy in Kosovo is sounding a warning.
We must change policy.
The riots and lynch mobs were easy to anticipate.
To do this, we must eliminate the traumas.
Four thousand people are still missing.
Traumas from the present as well.
We must aim for both and status.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
The Commission supports these efforts.
I hope we succeed.
I personally prefer active packaging around my bread.
That was not, however, the case.
We therefore need to clarify matters here and now.
It has been a pleasure to collaborate with her.
New developments require new standards.
A good system is sufficient.
That has been postponed.
I wish this report well and equally Mrs Thors.
I congratulate her on this report.
We have chosen to accept the compromise agreed upon.
We have nonetheless chosen to approve the compromise.
That is a constructive step along the road.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Our proposal addresses these rising trends.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It makes sense.
I hope the Commission can agree to that amendment.
What we have before us is a balanced result.
Two things still require some attention.
It is different in southern countries.
What do we say to future generations?
It has not done nearly enough.
I disagree with Mr Goodwill on the legal base.
I believe that should be remedied.
That is a serious omission.
Â Â  .
There are two other bans that deserve comment.
Thank you for this debate.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
People are in actual fact afraid.
We now have sound, comprehensive legislation.
Air pollution and climate change have also been addressed.
Instead, people must have the greatest possible knowledge.
There may perhaps be biological factors involved.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for your attention.
Today's epidemiological landscape has changed dramatically.
We still nevertheless have work to do.
Tobacco smoke contains over 4000 different chemicals.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
We are, however, not starting from scratch.
Let me first speak about the regulation.
Let me then move on to the directive.
I do not agree.
Now I will turn to the issue of ratification.
How can we say that so confidently?
I think that that is an excellent proposal.
We must be very generous in this regard.
Â Â  .
I am thinking in particular here of professional groups.
Â Â  Mr President, the Ãrhus Convention is very important.
Surely this is a reasonable consequence of signing it.
More seriously, this draft introduces some unacceptable measures.
They have undertaken to do so.
Nobody had therefore prepared for the vote properly.
Â Â  .
That is just one reflection.
In our view, the proposal is well balanced.
Once again, I thank you for the debate.
That is what this is about.
That would be reminiscent of an Orwellian society.
That is incorrect.
The joint debate is closed.
Why are we satisfied with the compromise reached?
What is happening?
Only four!
I hope that this is the beginning.
I would like to wholeheartedly thank the Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Thank you again, Mr Manders.
I see this as the right way ahead.
The âpolluter paysâ principle is excellent.
I hope that this does effectively apply.
We often hear mention of the .
That is the reality.
We are left with just a few verbal commitments.
We endorse the joint text.
Member States have quite a generous three-year timescale.
There are also long timescales before review.
So I welcome the agreement.
Â Â  . Mr President, allow me to interrupt briefly.
Â Â  .
It is a complicated and politically sensitive issue.
I am sure we have only seen the beginning.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
This Directive will make that method inadmissible in future.
I should also like to mention inert non-hazardous waste.
It is not sufficient to just make an inventory.
I believe that we have indeed achieved this result.
We have also seen this in these accidents.
The framework for doing so is now in place.
I do not believe that it is.
We feel it is an extremely important area.
There has to be accountability here.
All extractive waste has to include inert waste.
That is extremely important.
I support everything that the rapporteur has said.
This proposal deals with those environmental industrial problems.
In the end, we have a good result.
I commend the proposal to the House.
It is important to make this clear.
The Commission can support this strategy.
The problem must be tackled.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.

The Commission cannot accept the other amendments.
The Commission cannot accept the other amendments.
The Commission cannot accept the other amendments.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment: 7.
The remaining amendments cannot be accepted by the Commission.
(1)
The sooner it is in place, the better.
This will not be easy.
It will require give and take from all sides.
We also considered Cyprus.
This must be our answer to terrorism.
Europe is now to act!
This is a solidarity clause against terrorism.
That would make everything much easier.
We wish you every success.
We support you.
That is not sustainable.
This show will not be over in June.
Ratification is a mountain still to climb.
Let us be clear about that new decisive tone.
Europeans deserve better.
What do we see today instead?
They never choose a woman, mind you!
I think that would actually be a good idea.
In comparison with whom should we be competitive?
Something other than bridges and motorways!
We must be realistic about one particular situation.
The Constitution?
Move along, there is nothing to see here!
Move along, there is nothing to see here.
A final word on Iraq.
Countering terrorism is in large measure countering poverty.
Why now?
You have all our good wishes.
Please do not accept shoddy compromises in this area.
Â Â  Shamrock diplomacy from an unexpected quarter!
These measures have also been mentioned by Mrs Doyle.
Adieu, Giscard d'Estaing.
See you at the referendums on the EU Constitution.
Europe can and must act differently.
We do not need a European Patriot Act.
This puts the European Union in a new position.
That decision will certainly lead to public discontent.
Europe moves slowly, as Robert Schuman once said.
How true!
We are still waiting for the results.
Is the end of the blockade in sight?
Hopes for this are not unjustified.
The Irish presidency has so far done good work.
I hope that actions will follow!
Therefore there are two further questions.
There was very little of that this year.
The time for hesitation is past.
We had consolidated the advances concerning Europol and Eurojust.
This would be very serious.
The Lisbon strategy is not yet lost.
The European Union needs a new dynamism.
Further political measures are required.
It means implementation measures in the Member States.
Europe is once again at the crossroads.
We cannot let them get away with this.
Our citizens deserve no less, ladies and gentlemen.
I would like to thank them warmly for this.
This particularly applies to intelligence.
Free movement of the labour force must be guaranteed.
Is this reasonable?
Regrettably, the terrorists achieved their objective.
This should not be allowed to happen again.
There are still problems in the fight against terrorism.
We have to take heed of this.
Law-abiding citizens have no cause to fear in Europe.
The reaction so far has been relatively weak.
To this question, few answers have been given.
Â Â  .
We must not stigmatise the Arab world.
We are working with a real sense of urgency.
We have given deadlines in the declaration.
That is what I asked for last week.
I do not see any great difficulty about that.
I mentioned a few this morning.
The figure of 82 was mentioned this morning.
I could not agree more.
I made it when I met the social partners.
That has been useful.
A number of Members raised the budget issue.
The points were well made.
Points were made about the existing compromise.
We will emphasise those points in the debate.
I will take that fully into account.
Of course, we could have done nothing.
I am sure he will be very pleased.
You will have to settle this elsewhere.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at12 noon.
How decisive, however, is the Council?
When will the Council at last take responsibility?
These are allegations that I think should be examined.
To a great extent we agree with your position.
I once again emphatically reject the allegations.
Can we have the assurance that will happen?
Â Â  .
The contents of the letter are as follows:
This commitment shall not constitute a precedent.â
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
I have therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
This must be a geo-strategic priority for Europe.
This is something that Parliament has been calling for.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have no objections to this.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is an objective that we reject.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The real world is far from idyllic, however.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
For these reasons, I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
This could disguise the true condition of the food.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
This being so, we prefer to abstain.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I am very pleased with this European Commission proposal.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Only eight Member States have implemented it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This fortress Europe policy is nothing but shameful.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are all in this fight together.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These irregularities must be addressed.
Â Â  .
There are indeed other examples.
Â Â  .
The risks are greater among children than adults.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
I first wish to make a general point.
Let those who failed us shoulder their responsibilities.
Let me turn to a specific case.
Let me be quite clear here and now.
That may be done here in our plenary session.
It may be done when we meet in committees.
We will be led only by evidence.
(1)
Â Â  .
Secondly, the return of refugees and displaced persons.
Thirdly, good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation.
Fourthly, the judicial system and administrative infrastructure.
Seventhly, free market economy.
Eighthly, new government and European orientation.
Â Â  .
Regional cooperation has been strengthened.
However, it needs to meet the Copenhagen criteria.
Administrative capacities could also be improved.
Everything cannot be done in a day, however.
I believe these problems are close to being resolved.
That was foolish.
Are the problems already resolved?
No, they are not.
Macedonia has already submitted its application.
I say that as a representative of a minority.
Even that characteristic bitterness towards Slovenia no longer exists.
It still has a long way to go.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Volcic.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
This is the fourth report.
I turn now to the right of asylum.
Â Â  .
The report merits careful consideration.
Victimisation is also prohibited.
Participation is at the very heart of democracy.
Â Â  .
And they are institutions, not institutions.
I very much appreciate this statement.
The fact is that it does not.
That is truly wonderful.
Homosexuals suffer discrimination.
Racism and implacability towards immigrants are growing.
Millions of immigrants are excluded from society.
Muslims are being persecuted.
We expect a reply to this.
The first, inevitably, is the family.
Only the Italians have not been compensated.
She had been kept incommunicado from February 2002.
Two years incommunicado because of torture!
Ladies and gentlemen, ?
Its doing so would have achieved the same result.
Â Â  .
Mr President, the debate was very interesting.
That is very important and absolutely correct.
He is absolutely correct in that regard.
Europe is open to migration.
Both Mr Evans and Ms Kaufmann touched upon this.
We live in a less than perfect world.
I congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
This report certainly helps in that regard.
The future European Constitution points in this direction.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at12 noon.
Â Â  .
They merit some detailed consideration.
This is a particularly important initiative.
As I said, the response is still forthcoming.
Â Â  .
The OECD discusses guidelines for officially supported export credits.
A number of measures are needed in this regard.
There are numerous examples of loathsome financing.
Can we really speak of a development policy?
We must take its recommendations seriously, therefore.
Â Â  .
In fact it is quite correct.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This shortage of organs can encourage illicit trade.
This brings us to my second point.
I should like to speak about Mozambique.
In Mozambique, mystery surrounds Nampula Province.
Not all cases are the same.
Have you read it?
Mr Coelho referred to it earlier on.
What chance is there of real progress?
Indeed, what point is there in this debate?
Â Â  .
Madam President, we have had an interesting debate.
It is an astonishing debate.
Mr Lage and Mr CalÃ² made similar points.
Â Â  âThank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.(1)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I should like to highlight the main new elements,
Improvements have definitely been made.
Otherwise, this agreement would never have come about.
That cannot be changed.
In a word, it is absurd.
I also ask my fellow Members to support that.
I also welcome Commissioner Vitorinoâs intervention.
For example, maybe there is not enough fish.
Â Â  .
Therefore the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 1.
That is the situation we want to change now.
Therefore, Amendment No 3 is not necessary.
Finally, we cannot accept Amendment No 4.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is quite unacceptable.
One may then question the result obtained.
Is it really effective?
But no!
Do fundamental rights not count any more?
What happens if the data are misused?
Let us not even think about that.
Requirements that are unjust.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Why direct access?
The whole operation usually takes less than 48 hours.
Several million cars are registered in the EU.
The second argument in favour is transparency.
What kind of data are we speaking about?
The draft regulation remains useful even with these limitations.
I shall confine my remarks to three points.
A reading of the texts supplies no certain answers.
Notwithstanding that, this is an important issue.
I share and understand those concerns.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
I therefore welcome the Commissionâs two communications.
The current system clearly has its shortcomings.
Many asylum seekers do not actually need asylum.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What in fact was the question asked?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Thirdly, introducing transparency.
Fifthly, ensuring that all states contribute.
The EDF covers five years.
How?
Everyone knows this dossier well.
Â Â  .
The management of the European Development Fund is confusing.
This generally takes years.
There is poor parliamentary control.
That really should convince the Council.
It gives rise, however, to new problems.
Concerns are raised about multiannual funding of projects.
I believe it is essential to establish this control.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
That was not bad.
We emphasised this sensitive point strongly.
A further new initiative will be necessary here.
Â Â  .
But, finally, we have done so.
One black sheep is enough to undermine safety.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Let me give you some examples.
Firstly, the coordinator's independence remains untouched.
The Council took up this issue.
This is an untenable situation for the internal market.
Â Â  .
Today we are approving the nature of those rights.
We did this before making this proposal.
Slots are a general good.
That is the key issue.
Â Â  .
That is what we have.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We have come to the end of the agenda.
You have the floor, Mr Jarzembowski.
It also applies to the Americans.
Many thanks, Madam Vice-President.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Jarzembowski.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs Gebhardt.
The changes we want are revolutionary.
These observations bear out the report's basic idea.
The same applies to the cultural rights of minorities.
Another complex issue is the position of the army.
Elements of the are non-negotiable.
There is no room for negotiation.
The concept of deepening before enlarging still holds good.
The Helsinki strategy gave Turkey definite prospects.
I mention that as just one small example.
Let me return to the subject of Turkey.
We should recognise this and congratulate the Turkish authorities.
Many of us are working with that in mind.
The Cyprus question has been quite correctly mentioned.
Mr Oostlander's message is still profoundly negative.
I want to send a signal of positive encouragement.
Â Â  .
There are two explanations for this drop in employment.
Child labour also remains high.
I find this a valuable observation.
There is an urgent need for action here.
All these things take time.
Â Â  .
Mrs Smet spoke about this at length.
I will mention just two points.
Turkey is in a particular situation.
That is certainly one of the crucial difficulties.
I know that Commissioner Verheugen will do that.
Let me close by saying something about Cyprus.
This is certainly a highly significant step.
The rights of trade unions are not guaranteed.
We surely cannot take this seriously.
What does paragraph 7 say on this?
Surely not.
If so, in what form?
What about the structural funds?
This is a positive step.
Just as well!
That is clearly not the case.
That is the democratic deficit all over.
This is very much in our own strategic interests.
I have four brief comments to make.
That is, unfortunately, an inherent contradiction.
That is the truth of the matter.
That is the answer I wanted to give you.
That is not our idea.
In reality, it is far from it.
It contains a number of valuable recommendations.
I cannot share the same confidence.
This was not an isolated incident.
This seems to me rather like begging the question.
Finally, there is the Treaty of Lausanne.
Change cannot be brought about merely through economic aid.
Our position on Turkish accession is quite different.
I do not believe that we can.
We hope very much that this will take place.
His answer made reference to the Copenhagen criteria.
I think he was right.
The Turks must demonstrate compliance with the Copenhagen criteria.
We would answer in the negative.
This is a very serious precedent.
Down with thieving Rome, down with thieving Rome!
Long live freedom!
Long live the European Union!
That we owe to ourselves and to them.
There is still work to do regarding this.
Can they do it?
Mr Leinen mentioned the 1963 Association Agreement.
I really am very, very grateful.
Fortunately, reality is different.
MrÂ Erdoganâs government is doing its utmost.
And why are we small?
Let us look at demography.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  The Conference of Presidents met this morning.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  .
(1)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I would like to make a few points here.
Â Â  In short, the Commission upholds its proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, I listened carefully to the Commissioner.
Â Â  .
(2)
(3)
n
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is something I shall insist on.
Â Â  .
This is my sincere hope.
Hence the need to invest in research as well.
This seems too long to me.
I therefore voted in favour.
I therefore voted against the report.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
For these reasons, I have voted in favour.
Â Â  .
It is a modern form of colonialism.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
The peoples have the power to ruin their plans.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We voted against it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  We Swedish Social Democrats take the following views:
Item 28
Item 147
This is an obvious sleight of hand.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It frequently slipped into a maximalist approach.
This was unfortunately not the case.
This was unfortunately not the case.
Â Â  .
We therefore voted against this resolution.
I voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
The federalists are going round in circles.
Â Â  .
We have therefore abstained from voting on this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted against the resolution.
We must, however, connect Turkey with Europe.
Turkey must, furthermore, confront its past.
Â Â  .
What a charade!
This should also be debated within the European Union.
Legislative amendments without changes in practice are not enough.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  I have abstained in the final vote.
EU Member States do not occupy one another.
Only thus can we embrace a new future.
Turkey has everything to learn from this.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.(4)
(5)
It is great news for deaf-blind people.
Â Â  .
I believe these elements should play a key role.
Â Â  .
Our position in this regard is clear.
The European directives have certainly started the ball rolling.
That is heavy and demanding work.
These differences in implementation also lead to competitive problems.
The wording is of secondary importance.
That is the wrong road to go down.
Â Â  .
Mr President, first a word on waste definition.
This has also been widely supported by stakeholders.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the next part-session.
Â Â  .
That is a source of concern.
There will be a need for further action.
A priority will be the heating sector.
The aim is to offer affordable risk capital.
A feasibility study has been launched.
This will help achieve current and future targets.
Today this figure has doubled.
Above all, this should now be applied globally.
The Bonn conference will be the first step.
The figures quoted in it are extraordinarily high.
We have discussed some of the most important tools.
Important work has therefore already been got under way.
We are not alone in taking action.
On the contrary, it will become cheaper.
Think of the development regarding fossil fuels.
This development will continue.
Huge development is taking place in this sector.
This is something from which we shall all gain.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Posselt.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote on:
(1)
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
I have as yet received nothing in writing.
Are there any comments?(1)
Â Â  Thank you for your comments, MrÂ PodestÃ .
Â Â  I agree with you, MrÂ President.
This is a completely unfounded allegation.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President.
(2)
Those debates may run over into Question Time.
I do not wish to have that debate now.
Â Â  .
We therefore want an international agreement that grants rights.
This is the opinion of the majority of Parliament.
We are alone in being able to do this.
Â Â  .
No, this is not on.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
and
Â Â  .
Only later do you get the bill.
In such situations, good advice soon becomes invaluable.
Â Â  .
That will make things much simpler for everybody.
Â Â  .
I very much welcome this Commission proposal.
We would regard that as indefensible.
We should ask the Council to reconsider the matter.
We agree on a great many points.
Our problem is lack of time.
This term of office is coming to an end.
Our amendments are of a different nature.
The right to earlier repayment must also be improved.
The same goes for Mrs Gebhardt's proposal.
We are talking about consumer rights.
We call this being âin the redâ.
Â Â  .
Firstly, joint and several liability.
Cooperatives and credit unions were also mentioned.
There were problems with payment and problems with refunds.
This I can describe only as real-life satire.
The Commissionâs proposal starts from false assumptions.
The average loan is EUR 7000.
We have moved substantially in that direction.
Â Â  .
Firstly, enforcement cooperation.
Amendment No 76 successfully reconciles both traditions.
I therefore commend that particular approach to the House.
Some can be accepted partially or with limited changes.
Credit intermediaries should only be submitted to national supervision.
Registration requirements would no longer be foreseen.
This would reduce legal certainty.
That is not our ambition.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
This proposal has several objectives.
First, it aims to simplify.
This is hardly compatible with the single market.
Â Â  .
The committee felt very strongly about that.
Amendment No 74 explains why temporary MRLs are needed.
Amendment No 69 concerns integrated pest management.
Authorisation must be withdrawn on these.
We have tabled this amendment again.
We have tabled some amendments again.
That would be a welcome development.
Â Â  .
This is very important.
Here we are introducing the concept of temporary MRLs.
EFSA will also be deeply involved in scientific issues.
However, let us not forget the global aspect.
Consequently we also import a lot of residues.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Perhaps peopleâs positions will harden then.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Everyone is brandishing the slogan âless bureaucracyâ.
Â Â  .
Let me give you one figure to illustrate this.
That is our main purpose.
EU legislation in this field is necessary.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Quite the opposite is the case.
I shall be brief.
Each country will define its own standards.
We found that with the gas directive last year.
Firstly, investment incentives.
Thirdly, comitology.
Â Â  .
This measure should assist new entrants.
So much for the background.
My second recommendation is this.
If so, in what way was that done?
The first is availability and the second is price.
I cannot answer that question today.
The same would be true of its possibilities.
I cannot emphasise this enough.
AmendmentÂ NoÂ 3 could prove helpful in this regard.
This would mean restricting competition.
A detailed list will be provided.
Consequently, AmendmentÂ NoÂ 31 is not acceptable.
I could mention the gas and electricity liberalisation packages.
Community policy has come into play too.
This has been most important.
Good progress has been made.
We have worked well together.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
There must be an integrated approach to the issue.
All the Community institutions must work together too.
The latter can sometimes prove contradictory.
We learnt this whilst considering this Directive.
New tools for saving energy are important, therefore.
This is an innovative concept.
Â Â  .
Otherwise we can simply forget about climate change.
Why?
That is why there must be extremely severe penalties.
It will encourage individual countries to go it alone.
I do not think that is a good thing.
I urge the Commission to be ambitious.
This is a positive move.
There is big money at stake here.
Significant savings in energy consumption can be made.
In addition, comitology procedure must be launched.
These are the key issues I wished to mention.
I must emphasise the urgency of adopting this measure.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The compromise package before you is very delicately balanced.
I am also indebted to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
We have reached an agreement at first reading.
I will list nine points.
In my view, the result is sound.
We will not wait until Russia ratifies Kyoto.
Trees fall over or burn down.
Governments can also gain experience with sinks.
Neither has Greenpeace.
This is old-fashioned dogmatism.
I disagree on this point.
I can see why.
He therefore worked admirably with all the political groups.
Â Â  Madam President, I welcome this agreement.
The guidelines we have laid down there are useful.
It is not really a bad result.
Member States: we will be watching you!
Our European industry stands to benefit from this.
This brings me to the de Roo report.
Biomass burning gains a great deal from that.
Â Â  .
We will also have to be cost-efficient.
This will help us to do so.
First of all, Russia.
Therefore we will continue to work on that.
These are the arguments.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  We have noted what you say.
Â Â  .
Secondly, there are binding collection targets.
This old telephone contains a lithium-ion battery.
I suspect there is a dangerous tactic behind this.
I therefore have no economic interests to register.
Batteries have made a contribution to safety.
I support some of the amendments.
Lastly, the timescale.
Lobbying has been intensive and persuasive over this issue.
I am deeply cynical about these.
It all seems ridiculous.
Â Â  Madam President, cadmium is extremely toxic.
Why do we not do the same here?
Lithium-ion and nickel-hydride batteries are already on the market.
In future, fuel cells will become available too.
The alternative is thus in place.
Â Â  Madam President, cadmium is a dangerous chemical.
The use of cadmium should therefore be banned.
Â Â  .
We have proposed this closed-loop system for all batteries.
Those are our main arguments.
They must be taken care of.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I regret that.
The report contains many interesting insights.
That applies to industry, governments and consumers.
If it appears necessary, we shall make changes.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
The principle of good administration has also been introduced.
Â Â  .
This provision is particularly important for cross-border workers.
The new rules remedy this shortcoming.
That is progress.
That too is progress.
That is progress.
I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly.
We need to seek out solutions to these problems.
These are points mainly affecting frontier workers.
This regulation contains some valid points.
However, that is not all.
I see that as being unacceptable.
There are one or two points of concern.
This regulation represents a huge change.
This is a technical and complex issue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Dimas.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(1)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This was the first genocide of the twentieth century.
Â Â  .
Today is 19Â April.
This is a particularly serious situation.
The EuropeanÂ Union must not evade its responsibility.
Ghilardotti report
Amendment No 6 is acceptable in principle.
(1)
We reject the request for urgent procedure.
Nothing more nor less.
The Bureau now has 67 signatures.
(2003/2235(INI).
Let me now turn to the report.
Firstly, the clearing of the wreck.
I should like to comment on another few proposals.
We must first and foremost apply what already exists.
I am looking forward to your response.
Â Â  .
In this case that was not what happened.
Summer is coming.
Finally, paragraph 39 is also incorrect.
We also have two questions to settle.
I had this feeling following the package.
My thanks to all my fellow Members for this.
Certainly, many good intentions are expressed.
These are good guidelines.
This device has nevertheless produced very good results.
Ideology does indeed make you blind.
The measures adopted then have to be implemented.
Some are, whereas others really are seagoing hooligans.
Stronger measures against flags of convenience are essential.
Thank you, Galicians.
I thank you all.
Thank you all the same. .
Many thanks.
I will not go into the details.
These seamen have already been released and returned home.
The report contains many proposals to that effect.
This must also be done at European level.
That is a fair objective.
This would not be very logical.
This compliment also applies to the Commissioner.
I should now like to turn to my concerns.
First of all, the European coastguard service.
Firstly, the European coastguards.
Sixthly, ensure greater traceability of petroleum products.
Hitherto, we have devoted great attention to technology.
I therefore welcome the Sterckx report.
In this report, measures are proposed.
We will also produce the appropriate and relevant reports.
There is a separation of powers.
I will now comment on spills.
The minimum rules regarding crews are also international.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
This has not been possible.
This is not just an issue of external costs.
I must warn against leaving the door open here.
That cannot be right!
Some important comments have already been made.
Sooner or later it will happen.
He has really tried to achieve a viable compromise.
Mention has been made of the sensitive areas.
Nevertheless, warm thanks to the rapporteur.
Who pays for this?
This cannot be measured with political arguments.
The road network cannot be beaten.
Consider yourselves what that means.
Finland is one of the richest countries in Europe.
Greenhouse gas emissions are mainly attributable to road transport.
It looks like a new committee is being created.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Dhaene.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
What does that mean in concrete terms?
This directive replaces the one dating from 1988.
It relates to the monitoring of social regulations.
On the basic considerations, we all agree.
The same applies to adults.
Only repeated infringements should be regarded as serious.
That will need to change.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
One is Switzerland, and the other is Norway.
Â Â  .
It happened in the Baregg tunnel in Switzerland.
I should mention that the Council responded very positively.
Parliament has been very supportive throughout.
The same is true of the Council.
Parliament is to vote on it tomorrow.
It tabled 78 very detailed amendments at first reading.
I would also like to thank MrÂ Markov.
Good controls are essential.
Otherwise, the limits will not be observed.
Allow me to mention a few of these achievements.
Both air and rail spaces will become genuinely European.
Measures on maritime safety have been adopted too.
Some were debated this very morning.
Further, the Trans-European networks have been reviewed.
This involved an inordinate amount of joint work.
I have referred to some of the flagship ventures.
Social legislation has been taken forward.
I believe we can be reasonably pleased with ourselves.
We certainly have not wasted time.
I certainly agree it is very noisy at present.
Thank you for your collaboration.
Â Â  The Presidencycertainly supports the views expressed by MrÂ Swoboda.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12Â noon.
Firstly, there is MrsÂ Staunerâs report.
It would be appropriate to check.
I believe this is an important constitutional matter.
Â Â  I should like to make two observations.
The Rules are quite clear on this matter.
I invite the Groups to participate in this meeting.
This is that moment.
That is the first point.
The Parliament decided to do so yesterday.
That is illogical and legally untenable.
That is the first thing.
Â Â  Very good!
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
That is not my main point, though.
We have called this âcontractual interoperabilityâ.
Â Â  .
The entire air sector should benefit from this.
The Commissionâs proposal is good.
That needs to be emphasised too.
It meets the required security standard.
Does the Commission agree to withdraw the proposal?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That would be a sensible joint solution.
Â Â  Are there any objections to the oral amendment?
Â Â  I shall ask the rapporteur for advice on this.
Rapporteur, what is your opinion?
Â Â  .
We approved that motion.
Â Â  .
I still say that the amendment should fall.
Â Â  I will follow the advice of the rapporteur.
Â Â  I waive my right to move an oral amendment.
President. â That concludes the vote.
I share that view and voted for the report.
I am voting in favour of the report.
I voted in favour of the report.
I voted in favour of the report.
Hence our vote against the proposal.
I therefore endorse the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
True, the text could be improved.
The Council also rejected these two amendments.
I therefore support the final Common Position.
Indeed many directives have been adopted in this regard.
I therefore offer my wholehearted support to this report.
I therefore voted in favour.
Hence our vote in favour.
I welcome the Commissionâs proposal.
In this respect I agree ...
Â Â  .
We welcome all of this.
Â Â  .
This has been my view for some time.
We know what our obligations are.
We must ensure they are met.
Â Â  .
I voted against the de Roo report.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
This boldness was lacking at the first reading.
I am talking about the right to self-determination.
The text also fails to address this issue.
Â Â  .
Article 7 provides safeguard mechanisms.
Prevention must be combined with penalties.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
I therefore apologise for being late.
Welcome to the European Parliament, Minister.
Decision time is approaching.
Â Â  â Thank you everyone, especially you, Minister.
(1)
Â Â  .
I will leave such decisions to my political group.
I am sure this will please him!
It is not a bit-part player in the process.
Â Â  .
The same applies to the bureau of the committee.
It was a very good experience in every way.
I am extremely grateful to you.
The third point is the fight against poverty.
That is therefore one of our priorities.
That is also our last priority.
We note that large amounts remain unspent every year.
In other words, national declarations of good conduct.
Top priority must attach to the real Community policies.
Â Â  .
The Commission deserves full support in this.
The educational exchange programmes are a success story.
Â Â  .
New aid and development assistance is almost invisible.
Parliament already missed the opportunity provided by the Convention.
Members of this House will remember JoanÂ Colom.
The number of headings has been reduced.
My group is in favour of this.
The other important priority is cohesion policy.
One only has to look to the past.
But what and who will suffer as a result?
There are some encouraging signs that this may happen.
I hope it does.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
How specific are our proposals?
I believe that would constitute major progress.
Â Â  .
We also thank Mr Hatzidakis for his excellent report.
We fear that many valuable projects will be lost.
There are two points to be made.
The latter is a long-standing principle.
It can be found in the Treaties.
Social cohesion is achieved through other methods.
One of these is combating social exclusion.
Territorial cohesion has long been the subject of debate.
We simply help agriculture.
We wish the whole sector to be competitive.
Islands have to be helped.
Parliament and the Commission have reached agreement on this.
A number of initiatives have been very successful.
Solidarity is called for.
We must all work together to support the newcomers.
We value his work greatly.
I should like this to go on record.
We agree with bringing Lisbon-Gothenburg and employment under cohesion.
I find this most disappointing.
I should like to emphasise two key issues.
The first concerns the ultra-peripheral regions.
We have argued this strongly.
Parliament has no objections.
The limit is 90%.
The report largely endorses the Commissionâs proposal.
It does not, however, go beyond that.
Here too, clear differentiation is essential.
I wish today to endorse Mr Hatzidakis' proposal.
It will be drastically impoverished.
Â Â  Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
I see MrÂ PomesÂ Ruiz is at your side.
There can be no development without a productive population.
Ageing is not a territorial problem.
Firstly, a European cohesion policy is necessary.
The funds must be used wisely.
Â Â  .
The Commission will devote particular attention to this matter.
That is quite simply untrue.
There will be more money.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Substantial budgetary resources will be required in both cases.
We shall also support strengthening Europol and Eurojust.
It will actually try to take the lead.
We shall ask them to provide a mid-term programme.
Â Â  .
Enlargement itself will generate economic impetus.
This is simply not possible, Commissioner.
These are to combat poverty and promote human rights.
Â Â  .
We had three main priorities in our committee.
Â Â  .
Our decision to reform the CFP made good sense.
The report does this House credit.
I find that procedurally and politically unacceptable.
In this respect it is an unusual budget.
It must, however, also be adequate.
This is a massive recruitment and training exercise.
Â Â  The debate is closed;
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Members from three Member States are involved.
Let me be blunt about that too.
That is this Parliament's honourable task.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Section II â Council
Section IV â Court of Justice
Section V â Court of Auditors
Section VI â Economic and Social Committee
Section VII â Committee of the Regions
Section VIII â Ombudsman
Â Â  .
Both are essential.
Â Â  .
Firstly, we have the problem of shared management.
We must wait until 2005.
This is a matter of political responsibility.
In our opinion, this is not good enough.
Then we will pause for Croatia.
We cannot accept this situation.
We now have twelve agencies.
I would like to pay tribute to that.
Â Â  .
Parliament has made progress.
But two big eyesores remain.
This system is indefensible to the outside world.
The second question concerns Strasbourg.
The Commission and the Council are based in Brussels.
Clearly we must find a purpose for Strasbourg.
The buildings would be perfect for that.
I am grateful to them for having done so.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Third, there is the question of minority rights.
There remains the question of former General Ante Gotovina.
I repeat that this moment gives me considerable pleasure.
Here too, then, our assessment is positive.
Â Â  .
I endorse the points made by MrÂ Lagendijk.
Â Â  .
The Commission will not intervene in any way.
That is not meant at all ironically.
I have two concrete questions.
My question is: has that now finally happened?
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the item.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Â Â  .
This is not our aim.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Integrating the Iberian market is a very ambitious task.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
This is always good news for Europe.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is an economic and social crime.
Â Â  .
...
They are important and highly relevant to this discussion.
We should ask the Commission to look at this.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Dimas.
I have contacted our services to ask them why.
Â Â  We cannot open a debate on this matter now.
Â Â  .
E-learning and Daphne are examples of this process.
The European Parliament strongly supported both these programmes.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.
Have they already been submitted to the Commission?
What are the results?
Â Â  .
Its conclusions are positive.
That work is under way.
That will be the case.
You are fobbing me off.
What are these amendments?
However, today is officially Parliament's last sitting.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you for that reply, Commissioner.
Do you agree?
Â Â  .
Could this be possible?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is the roaming policy.
One cannot avoid the issue with answers like this.
Â Â  .
Mr Paasilinna is unhappy.
Â Â  .
He has acknowledged that these measures exist.
I believe they are absurd.
Â Â  .
The Commissioner will reply.
Â Â  .
I find this supplementary question totally unnecessary.
Â Â  .
We shall take the questions and the supplementary questions.
Â Â  .
We are not totally enslaved into this.
Today this partnership works.
Â Â  .
That is one case.
We would like to see greater transparency in general.
We believe that it must do so in future.
Every effort must be made to get this.
Now something about the Eurostat affair.
Nor have any amendments been submitted.
All the reports recommend that discharge be granted.
With respect, this is difficult to reconcile.
What are the key elements of this reform?
Is this really mere window dressing?
Let me focus on several aspects in detail.
The old Financial Regulation was 25 years old.
All this makes the Financial Regulation a great success.
It was high time to change this format.
Instead, investigations will be launched and action taken.
The Prodi Commission has faced up to this responsibility.
This is an important element of our modernisation measures.
Is there anything left to do?
Certainly.
MrÂ Bayona's report reveals this as well.
Â Â  . Mr President, it concerns two matters.
You ask yourself sometimes: is that so?
I note that this did not happen in 2002.
Â Â  .
I think he has prepared a constructive report.
I have been with you for both halves.
My second comment concerns the van Hulten report.
I think this is indefensible.
Finally, the Eurostat affair.
Mr Kuhne says: we need greater intercultural understanding.
Mr BrÃ¼ner should go!
That is our main interest.
We want an end to such fraud.
Up to now it has been wasting its time.
We merely insist that the Commission itself apportion responsibility.
We can then take note of any explanation.
It is as simple as that.
My warm thanks to you, many times over.
You have not been treated unfairly.
I very much miss him.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
I spoke to Secretary Ridge myself yesterday evening.
The United States was profoundly shocked by them.
In fact we were all shocked by those attacks.
The first is procedural.
Then the question of the agreement itself.
Parliament has asked for a real international agreement.
You said that there will be reciprocity.
That is not reciprocity.
Article 1 states what we have to do.
This is not a genuine agreement.
Unfortunately, he has not kept this promise.
At the moment they are not adequately protected.
I think that is extremely regrettable.
This has now been happening for a year.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I fully agree with the rapporteur.
This matter has taken a sorry course.
That is something we welcome.
Â Â  Mr President, the question is simple.
My group want a legal opinion on this.
I do not agree with that.
I think that is very important.
That is the issue.
The war on terrorism must be our first priority.
It is absurd to express that suspicion.
That is not the problem.
I do not believe that is the case.
Â Â  .
What if?
I will make one simple point.
When that happens, who will be blamed?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The debate will now proceed.
This research will soon be available to the Commission.
Mr President, I do not think so.
I think that the Commission does have this duty.
That is not new, Commissioner.
We do this in all kinds of policy areas.
Â Â  .
The question of subsidiarity is crucial in this context.
Â Â  .
That has detracted from the quality of the report.
We are still waiting for that Green Paper.
We recognise that the Member States have primary responsibility.
The issue deserved better.
Frankly, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, they are not enough.
This report could have helped to uphold it.
We know where it is.
Unfortunately, the report betrays it and mortifies it.
Can it be possible that Mediaset is lying?
This is not a new subject.
This is not acceptable.
This cannot be accepted, MrÂ President.
I call on MrsÂ Angelilli to name names.
I am therefore optimistic in this area.
What has happened?
There is not a word about that.
It is like that in Italy.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Let me come to calmer matters.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
That is completely out of the question.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We have not quite succeeded in that today.
We did make the effort!
(1)
This is not an issue of my political preferences.
Other procedural questions have been put to me.
How and when is rather complicated.
He urges our group to withdraw its amendments.
That means that 181 come from other groups.
That is my first point.
What is going on here is scandalous!
Â Â  I will deal with the voting issue at midday.
Thank you for your advice.
I need time this morning to do so.
Let me be quite clear.
The House debated this issue until midnight last night.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
Â Â  .
The choice and the decision is theirs.
The European Union has stayed the course with Cyprus.
They have a unique and historic opportunity.
It is a difficult time.
We understand that.
We understand the history.
Let me explain why.
The situation which has now arisen is as follows.
There can be no misunderstanding.
We could not speak for the Turkish Cypriots.
Let me be quite undiplomatic.
Sadly, this has not been achieved.
As before, I am willing to do so.
Let me make one point in conclusion.
The focus is almost entirely on trade aspects.
The Commission has fulfilled its pledge.
That is impossible to achieve.
The situation is not entirely comparable.
That is the difference.
We can do no more than that.
This means turning back.
Who with?
Under whose auspices?
With what international support?
The opposite is the case.
The present situation will be frozen.
Our draft resolution delivers a clear message.
Cyprus stands at a historic juncture.
The plan makes important concessions to both sides.
'Yes' took courage.
I would just ask them to reflect on this.
The Annan Plan is a .
These different assessments cannot be ignored, Commissioner.
We should not downplay the situation.
The country has undergone a war.
We were always resolute in our position.
And then you talk about the plan.
This House made it clear that that is unacceptable.
This is an historic plan.
What is our response?
â¦ the world will not become a better place!
We cannot allow that on grounds of political decency.
Then we will see what happens.
Very many of you are religious.
I believe in miracles.
That is of course unacceptable.
That is unacceptable.
It is no longer the Turkey of 1974.
New opportunities are unlikely to present themselves soon.
They are well-intentioned advice.
He was too polite.
They have been poorly led for years.
We cannot persecute our own citizens.
I think that a distorted picture has been given.
That is the truth of the matter.
A distorted picture is being given.
Let us call for that.
We will see to the rest later.
Thirty years of occupation is a long time.
Well, that people will have its say.
Let me give you some examples.
Obviously he had some other pressing business.
We want a yes vote.
These no longer exist.
Not in order to keep them divided.
This House bears some of that responsibility.
I welcome that call.
I am getting ahead of myself.
What is the Commissioner afraid of?
Who does the Annan plan serve?
It is the time of truth.
A no vote requires an answer.
We must ask the same of the UN.
Our resolution today reflects precisely this perspective.
They could not.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It does not come as a surprise.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
So be it.
I do not wish to dwell on those matters.
A settlement does not await some heavenly insight.
How could one hope for anything else?
Let me make a second point.
We must also reiterate that demand.
However, the result was a wake-up call.
We need a more intense EU-Israel dialogue.
The surrounding world largely forgot him.
The United States backs Israel 100%.
The EU could despatch troops to protect Palestinian areas.
The EU could go still further.
Some years ago, I met Shimon Perez.
Let us make use of the fact.
This must also be clarified.
Â Â  .
That is emphatically not the case.
That is certainly not the view of this presidency.
There is absolute agreement within the Union on this.
The Council of Ministers made that clear.
Questions arise as to whether the roadmap is dead.
There is nothing else available.
That point has to be made clear.
The issue of anti-Semitism was raised.
I agree with Baroness Ludford on that particular point.
Her point has been taken.
The European Union must be an even-handed player.
Suspension is not on the agenda at the moment.
Perhaps we should emphasise that responsibility.
That is not the case.
Suicide and terrorist attacks against civilian targets are condemned.
They are an abomination.
We all condemn them.
We have to be even-handed in this.
I believe that Europe is even-handed in this.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
He was talking about Cyprus.
I understand fully and I appreciate the concerns.
In the circumstances it is a good deal.
The status quo is unsustainable.
That is the important point.
They are healthy, positive and productive.
I had the opportunity to meet the MEPs involved.
We celebrate and commend that good work.
Â Â  .
First of all, HIV/AIDS.
Second, a brief word on China and Russia.
I believe that is the right timing.
We are indeed concerned by many things.
Earlier this morning, we discussed the Middle East.
We also want a serious approach to disarmament initiatives.
Europe will appear stronger and more united.
I shall reply to Mr Martin in detail.
I hope that the public will hear this reaction.
That was broadcast and discussed.
We will continue our work.
Your evidence of this unscrupulous behaviour named me.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
Perhaps I could have phrased that better.
I will not go through them all.
This is part of our European identity.
Let us stop this, please.
It is not acceptable.
Thank you.
You are very welcome here in the European Parliament.
We have 338 amendments.
I have received a report back from the committee.
So, why are we not voting right now?
Here we begin a rather sorry story.
That is my proposal.
We are facing an obstacle course.
And I will therefore end, Mr President ...
...
You have 350.
I would ask for this fact to be noted.
Â Â  .
Â Â  We have heard from the Groups' spokesmen.
I would now like to take your advice.
Â Â  . â I am surprised.
I would ask that somebody answer my question.
...
Â Â  Would everyone please relax.
Please calm down.
You will all get a fair hearing.
I do not know the detail.
Â Â  .
The majority would decide that.
I am sorry for the long delay.
Now you have got to earn your lunch!
Mr PodestÃ  will take the remaining votes.
I hope that the Commission and the Council agree.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I demand that it should be declared inadmissible.
This is not the point.
I request that paragraph 24 be declared inadmissible.
Â Â  .
Mr President, there is a misunderstanding here.
They are no longer relevant.
Perhaps that was an error in interpretation.
Â Â  .
It is also 2.10 p.m.!
Â Â  I leave it to the House to decide
Â Â  .
However, the wording is too specific.
Â Â  .
Before the vote on Amendment NoÂ 2:
I would ask that this correction be made.
Of course, I voted against.
A further measure concerns the Azores and Madeira.
I voted in favour.
This deserves my support.
For all of these reasons I voted in favour.
Indeed, tobacco consumption represents significant public health risks.
Accordingly, I abstained.
Each product is separately defined with separately specified contents.
Â Â  .
We have no objections to this.
Furthermore, I support all the Green amendments.
Life III expires on 31 December 2004.
Naturally, I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
I reluctantly voted for this report.
Â Â  .
This proposal represents a step towards that goal.
I could not vote in favour of the report.
We have substantial reservations about both of these matters.
I voted in favour.
Fortunately, they were voted out.
This is in bad faith.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Different national company law systems must be respected.
This report proposes deviations from the agreement.
Â Â  .
And he was applauded for that!
It is a disgrace!
Â Â  .
The resolution clearly supports the Annan plan.
This is why we voted against the report.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Hence our vote in favour.
The Sterckx report is broadly inadequate in this respect.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
(1)
You are very welcome here.
Thank you for coming.
Crucial to the Bush strategy is armed preventive attacks.
That applies to the European Union itself.
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Roche.
Thank you very much for your comments.
I share this view.
Some have been quoted.
Difficulties arise when other institutions come into the frame.
Â Â  .
That is a debate for another time.
Even the happiest marriages occasionally have points of disagreement.
I would certainly agree with that view.
Mr Belder mentioned the Marshall Plan.
The forthcoming EU-US Summit in June is vital.
I agree.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
- Council and Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan
and the
Â Â  .
That view is shared by Pakistan itself.
The European Union will continue to monitor this issue.
We are concerned at all these issues.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
My impression is that they want this agreement concluded.
They are right.
Â Â  .
Something quite different is at stake.
Pakistan is among them.
Â Â  .
There are benefits to what is proposed.
Â Â  .
The issues raised are of great importance.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
This is a mixed picture.
Second topic: terrorism.
The report unequivocally condemns all forms of terrorism.
Third topic: reproductive health.
This is a little known area of health.
Fourth topic: the rights of disabled people.
Â Â  .
My position on the fight against terrorism is clear.
It has been set out several times.
I will reiterate it here.
But there is still some way to go.
We are extremely grateful for the report.
Â Â  .
It is an important debate.
It is an important focus of the Irish presidency.
All of that is to be welcomed.
We must also address the causes of terrorism.
Let me again congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
This shows just how false your approach is.
Social workers knew about this for 25 years.
Shame on them!
Is this genuine?
Have we really drawn the correct conclusions?
Unfortunately, this is still not the case.
They have intrinsic value.
They do not have abstinence as a choice.
The report before us contains all of these faults.
Secondly, a word about reproductive health.
Womenâs rights are human rights.
Proposals 28â40 are important additions to support.
Yet exactly the opposite has happened.
Capitalist globalisation generates the globalisation of violence.
I have decided to devote my speech to Syria.
Our democracies have ways of exerting pressure.
We have no news of them.
So Mr President, thank you and farewell.
Could we go to war and still remain democracies?
There is also a new danger here.
Â Â  .
Human rights are not divisible.
I wish him well.
I wish them all well.
I want to finish on a positive note.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Otherwise, I recommend voting against that amendment.
I am sure Mr Nielson is pleased about that.
The Commission does not have an open mind.
It wants to keep the entire programme to itself.
Two hundred and eighty million Arabs live without democracy.
Is he proud of that?
That would have been a tragic mistake.
Â Â  .
Such a clear question deserves a clear answer.
This is well-known.
One reason is that we are not effective ourselves.
However, we have to try.
That is the nature of this kind of activity.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
They are a shared cultural space.
They show our diversities at their best.
Why will it be only one stage?
She is well aware of this.
She has even alluded to it briefly.
That is my prediction.
The PPE Group has been taken in hand.
Anything else would make no sense at all.
I think you are aware of that too.
I am a German MEP.
We hope that the Commission can resolve this issue.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Vila.
The jury protested.
They even still speak Luxembourgian there.
The same applies to Liverpool.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
What is the proposal?
The Commission accepts them, with some exceptions.
This task is not part of their primary responsibilities.
With this addition, the Amendment would be acceptable.
This modification is also acceptable.
As already mentioned, these instruments already exist.
Nobody has to wade through all five documents.
This is now going to change.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Mrs Muscardini has withdrawn her signature.
That brings the number of signatures to 67.
In fact all the warning signs were completely ignored.
Â Â  .
Was it really their concern for transparency?
I do not think so.
I am sure it was not.
There are two reasons why I think not.
It is true that everything is not perfect.
We have noted the measures taken by the Commission.
We have learnt from this.
I am in favour of resisting.
That is the decisive point.
He has now signed the motion.
The same can be said of the Eurostat scandal.
All the defence mechanisms have been set in motion.
You could call it nepotism.
This occasionally happens in our Member States.
That is not true parliamentarianism.
EURÂ 8Â billion disappears from our budget every year.
The assessment made by that resolution is damning.
We therefore believe that this motion is inappropriate.
That is not the case here.
Is that the democracy that you are talking about?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the May part-session.
Let me conclude with that.
We are currently blindly working towards that goal.
There was only a minor split between the parties.
What happened was not liberalisation but scrapping.
What is at issue is the appropriate balance.
We will see what to do about passenger traffic.
Unfortunately, reality is still far removed from that.
An important area of concern was passenger transport.
No one has the key to liberalisation as such.
I believe that we have achieved this objective.
I therefore thank the rapporteurs for their work.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
The Commission proposal has two main parts.
This mechanism provides risk capital for launching technology companies.
The proposal was submitted in December 2003.
We would like the opposite.
We would like a rationalisation project.
I will not elaborate further.
What is the Commissionâs opinion, Commissioner?
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Our basic budget was EUR 163 million.
The deal expired at 1.30 p.m. this afternoon.
The future is bright.
I turn now to the e-content+ programme.
We will see much more European digital learning material.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
(1)
This is not acceptable in a democracy.
He has served his sentence.
Â Â  We shall bear this in mind.
I shall pass this request on to the President.
Â Â  .
I first met her in the late 1980s.
There has been complete over-reaction from the very beginning.
This is not before time.
Two examples.
The situation is quite extraordinary.
This cannot continue.
It has been restarted twice.
The verdict is identical.
Â Â  .
This is comparable to the situation in Guantanamo.
It is not good enough.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
This is the subject of Amendment 5.
Â Â  .
They are there in the employment guidelines.
She is right to make that call.
We would be happy to accept such an amendment.
Thank you.
The EU economy still suffers major problems.
Nor is growth in the eurozone impressive.
We are well aware of the current figures.
Certainly, competition will become tougher.
It has done so already.
It is already flexible.
Certainly, the rules can be reviewed, but
The Lisbon process must be implemented in full.
I cannot see how it could be otherwise.
Companies do not want them.
We need to pin our hopes on public investment.
This needs to be increased.
This scenario did not work.
I think that there are alternatives.
A passive attitude will do nothing to encourage growth.
Thank you, Mrs Randzio-Plath.
How can investment be encouraged?
Two ways are possible.
Failure is inevitable.
Another way is to be opened up.
The greatest ambiguity reigns as regards its interpretation.
National policies differ.
It needs to be said.
We do not want that.
Little progress has been made since Lisbon.
I wonder whether it is enough though.
Mr Kok proposes discussing and encouraging flexibility and security.
Research and innovation have been particularly highlighted recently.
Why is it so important for us?
Size definitely matters.
This clearly does not yet exist in Member States.
We must strengthen implementation.
We cannot continue to dodge the issue.
Primary responsibility lies with the Member States.
The Union simply intervenes in a coordinating capacity.
There are, of course, two ways.
This simply means measures against the workers.
It is time we realised this.
Where do our opportunities lie?
Â Â  .
I should like to formulate a few more conclusions.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
(1)
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Something else was said, and I regret that.
I do not intend to allow another wide-ranging discussion.
I shall give explanations about what I have said.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Here is a very pragmatic suggestion, MrÂ President.
Â Â  .
So there it is.
That being so, the divisions have been inevitable.
Â Â  That was very neutrally put!
(1)
Â Â  We will not reopen the debate.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Â Â  This is a very sensitive issue.
I will be brief.
We will now move on to the vote.
You are always looking after Members' interests!
Fortunately that is not the case.
The two words have been removed.
You should have been informed of that.
Â Â  We will continue to vote on the paragraphs individually.
Â Â  I am sorry, you are wrong.
Who feels the consequences of what is indicated here?
I wish you well.
(2)
That concludes the vote.
I myself told him about the matter.
Hence my vote.
I voted for rejection of the proposal.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted against the initiative.
I agree with this report and voted for it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of it.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  .
Christian Solidarity Worldwide promptly circulated a briefing to MEPs.
Human Rights Watch did not respond.
Neither responded.
In 2003 both issued reports condemning Pakistan.
Â Â  .
This proposal gives him the same status in Europe.
Consequently, I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Poverty and social exclusion continue to rise.
The increase in unemployment in Europe is certainly disappointing.
Â Â  .
Peacemaking efforts must take place within UN mandates.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Unfortunately the reason for this is rarely discussed.
Â Â  .
We need to nurture peopleâs confidence.
Â Â  .
Â Â  . I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the report.
I am thinking in particular of mountain regions.
These areas have many resources.
We know how those handicaps seriously hamper their development.
Â Â  .
Less money and less bureaucracy can produce better results.
All other projects should revert to the Member States.
Naturally, I voted in favour.
But he is not telling the whole truth.
Parliamentary control must be strengthened.
That caused the collapse of the previous Commission.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Procedures are important.
More than 400 people have lost their jobs.
Parliament is content with an innocuous and useless resolution.
Â Â  .
At that point I immediately demanded transparent action.
This could be done by a parliamentary inquiry.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The British Labour Members voted against paragraph 53.
Â Â  .
However, this report is far from balanced.
That is stretching a point to say the least.
That is the spirit emanating from this report.
Â Â  .
They are abusing democracy in order to abolish democracy.
Â Â  .
In fact, that is not the case here.
It is detrimental to us all.
It represents an injustice and a threat.
It is a threat to democracy.
It is a threat to the rule of law.
Furthermore, the subsidiarity principle has clearly been violated.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I do not believe there is a contradiction.
The votes today are quite sensible and straightforward.
This explains why I voted as I did.
Moreover, the regime has chosen to imprison opponents.
This is understandable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The murder of the Palestinian people continues.
I voted against the report.
Â Â  .
This is not all, however.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.(3)
(4)
They are also less often self-employed.
Â Â  .
Democracy has not reached the women of the Balkans.
Each country has its own distinctive reality.
In Croatia, violence against women goes unpunished.
We must open our eyes, Mr President.
There cannot be first- and second-class citizens.
The marketing of women must be very strongly condemned.
I notice that a lot is happening there.
I have mixed feelings though.
So a lot of work remains to be done.
What are they doing?
This makes the networks much more sophisticated.
It takes a lot of work.
That is the current situation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Â Â  .
However, much still remains to be done.
The mine threat can be overcome.
I also welcome the preparations for the Ottawa Conference.
Â Â  .
This is part of the problem.
The debate is closed.
We also roundly condemn what is happening in GuantÃ¡namo.
Half of these involved people-smuggling.
Why do ordinary Cubans take such risks?
That picture is not entirely accurate.
What promises do people-traffickers usually make?
I have personal experience of this.
It is therefore correct.
Now is the time for expressing your ideas.
This is what is at stake.
Mention has been made here of double standards.
This is a diabolical state of affairs.
For that, they were given extremely long sentences.
On the contrary, we defend them.
I take a thoroughly critical view of it.
Â Â  .
This is not the case.
In our analysis things have not improved.
We regret the current situation.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
What a pity that this no longer happens.
It was a tribute to human individuality and dignity.
This resolution is a justified response to this exploitation.
The reverse is true at present.
It is tempting to look well into the future.
This is an issue of human dignity.
Â Â  .
It has taken various policy initiatives in this field.
In my view they are not a special case.
They lost their innocence ages ago.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
Hope was strong and sincere.
The perpetrators are, once again, Muslim fundamentalists.
What should be done?
There is no Christian fundamentalism in Nigeria.
Â Â  .
We have similar views on this situation.
This is what the country is trying to organise.
Â Â  Mr President, may I make a request?
Â Â  Thank you, Mr RÃ¼big.
I was not aware of being spied on.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote(1).
(2)
Â Â  .
Major change does not, therefore, occur overnight.
This situation must stop.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  .
That is what we must all achieve together.
We are witnessing an historic moment in this Parliament.
Mr President, these are historic days and moments.
We can only do it together.
That dream has become reality.
We should congratulate them all.
It was our House that did that!
Let us rejoice in that!
That will benefit all of us.
And that is what makes the difference.
It is democracy that has allowed this to happen.
Europe is being reborn.
Why?
That is the challenge facing Europe todayâ.
Enlargement increases the urgency of this demand tenfold.
Otherwise, the law of the jungle will prevail.
That is true.
Therefore, we must all take action.
Polish is the language of over 40 million Europeans.
He is our guest today in this Chamber.
Â Â  MrÂ President.
We get something in return for our vote.
It counts.
As a voter, I have some significance.
I help to wield influence.
History does not develop by chance.
Europe would like to be political.
These are political acts of faith.
What are the true pillars of reality?
Are there any comments?
'I have never ever made these claims.
I am an Austrian.
I have never heard of these lawsuits or claims.
Do you accept that some reform is necessary?'
I replied: 'Absolutely necessary.
MrÂ Martin interjected: 'But for additional privileges.'
He is a deceitful masquerader, damaging our reputation.
Someone like him has no part in public life.
These corrections will be struck from the Minutes.
(1)
Are there any comments?
Â Â  Procedurally, the House can decide that tomorrow.
Â Â  .
We will hear the rapporteur.
(1)
They tackled the source of conflict at its root.
Â Â  .
He would have reason to rejoice.
Like Monnet, Spinelli was a man of vision.
Monnet laid the foundations for this enterprise.
The European Union has risen to this challenge.
That day is upon us.
We cannot simply stand back and admire our handiwork.
Now is the time for new ambitions.
We wish them well in that work.
Â Â  .
The famous step-by-step policy.
And that is what happened.
We cannot stop now, we cannot turn back.
âLet us unite menâ, said Monnet.
Because today's present is a wonderful one.
The baby was important.
Many people were not impressed.
He was successful in building up a consensus.
Now they have joined the EPP-ED Group.
We must ensure that Constitution is adopted.
Eurosceptics say that we are investing in a dream.
Fare well, Europe.
We must not underestimate the magnitude of this task.
I am not an anti-federalist but a realist.
This is what Europe was.
Europe then was in prison or had been murdered.
We need to say it clearly, MrÂ President!
Principle number one is respect for difference.
Principle number two is institutions that respect differences.
I believe that is now possible.
That concludes the debate.
Â Â  .
We all agree that the Commission must be effective.
These are not in question in the Intergovernmental Conference.
These principles are not in question in the IGC.
Of that I am absolutely convinced.
There is ample justification for such displays of enthusiasm.
We chose the constitutional path.
The decision-making process must be made more transparent.
I understand Mr Rocheâs argument.
Where necessary, alternative solutions must be sought.
Let us consider the previous enlargements.
Finally, we now have a Community of 25.
Commissioner Vitorino also made reference to that.
Such a thing must not be permitted.
The Constitution is a means to that end.
We are now in a very complicated situation.
The answer is certainly 'yes'.
Perhaps Minister Roche could explain.
What exactly does this analysis say?
See you soon!
That is a shame.
Liberal democracy has triumphed.
Warfare between the nations of Europe is unthinkable.
The new Member States now join these debates.
With enlargement the Atlanticist cause will be strengthened.
What do we need the Constitution for?
The EU will never be the same again.
We therefore need a book of rules.
We need a Constitution.
We face huge challenges.
Here in Parliament, we have done our homework.
We put our weight behind setting up a Convention.
We actively contributed our views.
â The gallery does not participate in the sitting.
Therefore, quiet please.
This would amount to surrendering national sovereignty.
Europe cannot cut itself off from its Christian roots.
I find the language that is used fascinating.
Cooperation means coercion.
More is the pity.
In Old Polish, I wish it Godspeed.
What are these foundations?
This is the type of Europe that is wanted.
We want a well-managed Europe.
An institutional balance is required.
An accommodation is called for.
This will make for deeper integration.
The European Union has to be able to function.
Our citizens want more Europe.
Today we are discussing the future of Europe.
We hope to endorse and adopt the European Constitution.
We cannot go along with this.
These are not good omens.
The European venture is not yet complete.
New states are waiting at our doors.
Soon Bulgaria and Romania will join.
Much remains to be done.
These issues cannot make the democratic constitutionalisation process fail.
I have also referred to financial sufficiency.
This session is not our first experience together.
This is particularly true in the new Member States.
I shall continue in Maltese.
Mr President, we created and moulded Europe.
Now it is important that everyone feels equally European.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This is the vote, not a debate.
There are some misunderstandings here.
That has been done.
I shall take no more speakers on this.
You heard a speaker for and a speaker against.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  That has been duly noted, Mr Duhamel!
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
My masters, are we mad?
So far not one penny has arrived.
He has failed spectacularly.
We get nothing but excuses and cover-ups.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I immediately demanded that the facts be published.
Investigation by Parliament makes that possible.
Â Â  .
That is how the Commission compiles its statistics!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote in writing.
(1)
He also claimed that I leave Strasbourg early.
MEPs are prisoners of flight schedules.
Â Â  .
The sequence is clear.
First the political criteria and then the negotiations.
Â Â  .
The regulation was necessary for a smooth accession process.
However, those who did come were very welcome.
This Parliament serves the people of Europe well.
It is a model of parliamentary performance.
Therefore, I have three remarks to make.
These are debates that will come later this afternoon.
I remember visiting Lithuania a few weeks after independence.
We should remember their sacrifice.
The hard part really begins today.
That must be our priority.
We must also have more and better security.
We have invited them to Parliament during the part-sessions.
That is not, however, the end.
The EU will continue to grow.
The country has been modernised and democratised.
The EU will be undergoing enlargement for many years.
We must find both common and bilateral solutions.
This will be a priority task.
Enlargement, however, is continuing.
I also enjoyed it very much.
I have two small suggestions.
The first is for the Commission and the Council.
This is too few.
I have two requests to the Government of Cyprus.
We have been told.
They, after all, are most closely involved.
The same applies to Croatia.
That is just not logical.
We therefore have good reasons for pride and satisfaction.
Let us hope it is gone forever.
I agree with Commissioner Verheugen.
The plan legalises the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen.
Please accept this gift from the people of Poland.
We long for justice and progress.
The cross stands for love triumphant.
You must have the courage of your convictions!
Is it no more than a free trade area?
Is it only the common currency and common market?
For me, that would be too little.
That is the challenge we have to set ourselves.
Where does Europe end?
That is a point for Commissioner Nielson.
They can never become members of the European Union.
Is this a change in the Commission's position?
Euro-enthusiasts cried âEurope, here we are!â
Thus was political unification achieved.
United, we are stronger and wiser.
There have also been numerous damaging corruption scandals.
This is a kind of disease.
Now everything depends on us.
The conditions were as follows.
A further basic condition must be added.
Poland overcame occupation by Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.
Thanks to its faith in God and thanks â¦
That is why we believe in cooperation.
We must not stop here.
Our desire is to reunite our country.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen.
Belarus is completely terrorised by the communists.
These ten countries bring great potential.
Welcome to you all, all ten of you.
God bless our joint work.
This will make the new neighbourhood complete.
I warn against it.
We have a choice to make:
or,
The greatest enlargement in 47 years has been completed.
It is an issue affecting an Arab people.
Indeed, some may be moving towards self-fulfilling prophecies.
Â Â  .
This was a political decision made by the Council.
The Commission will work out how to clarify it.
The Council decision will be respected.
It will in fact be strengthened.
I have strong views on this.
This is where we are.
The challenge is still there.
I would warn against unrealistic expectations.
That said, the debate today has been positive.
This is not what we should do.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
It needs an economic leg and a political leg.
This will take years to accomplish.
There is warm friendship and cold acquisitive greed.
Â Â  .
Now, what constitutes the European social model?
Solidarity without competition would lead to stagnation.
That is still the noblest task of politics.
Any merger agreement must include social clauses.
That is the Europe we are to build.
That alone that will make us strong.
The enlargement of the European Union ...
What, though, is the reality?
A different outlook on the economy is required.
We advocate involving the rich in assisting the poor.
Poland entered the Union on demeaning, unequal terms.
The Polish negotiators are to blame for this.
Production is decreasing.
The figure for sheep farming is 35 years.
Self-Defence is calling for renegotiation of the Association Agreement.
The European Union must return to the highest values.
in order not to lead to social revolution.
The alter anti-globalists are right.
The European Union and Poland both need Self-Defence.
I very much regret that.
We must face up to facts.
Estonia cannot look only to financial gain in Europe.
Being among the best is ennobling.
I believe the Union will achieve this aim.
We can achieve far more if we work together.
It would be a Europe of solidarity.
These settlements were imposed on Poland by force.
The Swietokrzyskie voivodship is one such example.
We need help to develop our infrastructure.
The public appreciates the socio-ecologically corrected free-market economy.
Strengthening the unity of the European Union â¦
My reply is that it will.
It must survive.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the European workforce is expensive.
We are now in the year 2004.
Our first goal is a sovereign Poland.
Our second goal concerns the economy.
They will be local jobs.
The second great guiding principle is that of rights.
The average gross national product per capita is lower.
The number of poorer persons has increased significantly.
Our common market has grown.
Social Europe imposes restrictions on economic Europe.
It reduces the competitiveness of the economy.
Mr President, I can speak in Spanish.
We do not agree.
I am pleased that the Commissioner reaffirmed this point.
This is the way to create viable public services.
Environmental protection also creates growth and stability.
I mentioned earlier the cohesion report.
I will end with a few words in Maltese.
The other political party in Hungary talks about modernisation.
Our wish is to be part of this.
We must give impetus to this policy.
I am optimistic.
These words do have real meaning.
Poland is a country of great opportunities.
We shall prove a tower of strength for it.
I trust Europe will not let Poland down either.
I believe that everything will come right.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
It is important that we address those fears rationally.
Freedom, security and justice.
I reject that.
You spoke of companies and businesses.
There is a lot for us to do.
I shall just mention a couple more.
I hope that will be taken on board.
Even a temporary restriction.
Ladies and gentlemen, something else is happening here.
This connection must also be borne in mind.
This is not acceptable.
Everybody should be entitled to equal rights.
We have to take down the barriers.
Some prevention, and some stopping.
The day has yet to declare it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to correct you.
You deserve our thanks, Commissioner Vitorino.
The European Union in itself is proof of this.
These, however, are just the first steps.
We have a big job ahead of us.
I have just presented you with a pamphlet.
It is called 'Europe Needs an FBI'.
This should not happen.
This includes Turkey.
I think the correct answer is the latter.
There is no rational justification for these decisions.
This is what will happen this time.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I will be very brief.
This is not just a question of faith.
Thank you so much.
The debate is now closed.
(1)
(1)
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order.
I fear these two precedents on 29 April.
I will not repeat what she said.
I wanted to draw your attention to that.
I shall do so this week.
Â Â  Thank you Mr Perry.
Politics abhors a vacuum.
This is now our fifth directly-elected mandate.
The first is the euro.
The third event is the Convention.
We are right behind you.
On that, Mr Poettering and I agree.
Europe is suffering from deficits in employment policy.
We want a Commission with which we can argue.
Let us read between the lines here.
This House should show a similar maturity.
This continuity can and should be an asset.
Events, however, proved the European public right.
I should now like to make two specific appeals.
My second appeal is as follows.
You may well expect us to be sour-faced today.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Do not adopt the usual tactics of certain Commissioners.
European democracy only stands to benefit from this.
In short, make sure that you are verifiable.
You act to their disadvantage.
It is time to introduce a European social model.
These are the most important of all international instruments.
Are these to remain empty words?
Are we not bound to implement them?
This would be neither Communism nor capitalism.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  . â This is a sensitive issue.
Thank you.
Â Â  Thank you for that valedictory statement, Mrs Banotti.
I am pronouncing this verdict openly.
Â Â  . â I totally agree.
In this we succeeded.
Can the Commission look into this matter urgently?
I should like to give two reasons for this.
I could make the list of conflicts much longer.
Good luck!
I know there is a lot to be done.
Well, you are in for a surprise!
Euroscepticism is alive and growing.
Such a Europe will survive.
I am fortunate to know many of them.
They are very experienced, skilful, good people.
That is a very sensitive and important issue.
We have no particular problems with these countries.
This is the main problem.
We are thus operating a double standard.
That is Europe for you!
Â Â  .
What a change I have brought to these institutions!
Not a propaganda policy, but a communication policy.
I feel that these are strong arguments.
Africa is our responsibility.
Europe has 800 million inhabitants.
My final comment is addressed directly to the President.
Â Â  . â My answers will be very brief.
I was a second-class citizen.
I represent a country that has joined Europe.
Ukraine is a part of Europe.
It shares our cultural heritage.
As for Ukraine, I agree entirely.
We are not turning our backs on that country.
This is a union of peoples and nations.
Â Â  .
We need more cohesion.
The turnout during the hearings was generally very low.
Â Â  That concludes the item.
Our actions have ranged much wider.
I am proud of that fact.
What did we as parliamentarians bring to enlargement?
We brought the animation of politics.
We brought the Europe of values.
In Parliament, we emphasised the parliamentary dimension.
We parliamentarians are in direct contact with our constituents.
We know their anxieties and aspirations.
We must bring vision and give leadership.
The failure by Council is not our failure.
It is a disgrace.
I thank my cabinet.
Europe has been the cause of my political life.
I have to take a deep breath!
I would like to highlight briefly two achievements.
Next weekÂ ...
...Â We are members of a parliament.
This is my last wish.
You have been an excellent President.
Â Â  Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am grateful for your advice.
It was concluded this morning.
Thank you.
This is the measure of a true democrat.
This report has been prepared.
I have two further announcements to make.
Thank you very much.
(1)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Parliament has completed its agenda.
Josep Borrel Fontelles
BronisÅaw Geremek
Francis Wurtz
The following Members have been designated as tellers:
Mr Louis
Mr PÃ¡lfi
Mr Paleckis
Mr Ortuondo Larrea
Mr Onyszkiewicz
Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou
Mr Pannella
Mr Pistelli
I am very aware of this.
Thank you very much.
I come from CentralÂ Europe.
Nonetheless, we won through.
We are now free and independent nations.
My dream is of a Europe of solidarity.
This House is an institution for such a Europe.
That is the way it is.
That too is what democracy is about.
We shall now proceed to the election.
Number of voters: 700
Blank or spoiled ballot papers: 53
Votes cast: 647
Absolute majority for election in this ballot: 324
The votes cast for each candidate are as follows:
JosÃ© Borrell Fontelles: 388 votes
BronisÅaw Geremek: 208 votes
Francis Wurtz: 51 votes
Furthermore, many international issues will demand our attention.
Thank you very much to all of you.
This is one of Parliamentâs foremost tasks.
All the best and congratulations!
The result that we have is an honourable one.
Mr Poettering spoke of the need for stability.
That also matters, including in political life.
Some of the candidates are very new.
I suggest that in future candidates make one-minute presentations.
We shall proceed to the vote(2).
(3)
(1)
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Martin.
The European Union is not a matter of theory.
They have been the ingredients of Europe's success.
I have no hesitation in recommending him to you.
We deeply appreciate all their help.
The last six months saw very substantial progress.
2004 marks the end of this five-year Tampere programme.
Like Parliament, I wish it well.
They gave me very good advice.
Courtesy was shown to all my colleagues.
The experience has been enormously rewarding.
It is a challenge for a small country.
We do not have an enormous bureaucracy.
I wish you every success with it.
Nobody is pretending that this is a perfect Constitution.
I must say that that is not the case.
You spoke about the Intergovernmental Conference.
The Council of Ministers is made more transparent.
There are two people whose appointments you mentioned.
He has not changed.
That is not on.
That is not just a matter of protocol,
Let me just say two things in general terms.
None of that is fair.
The European Union comes out stronger.
We must be a campaigning Parliament for the Constitution.
We were there, we were players.
It will also be our problem to resolve thereafter.
MrÂ Ahern spoke of the asylum agreement.
I thank you all the same.
We really cannot go on like this!
I think he got it right.
The electorate is entitled to a vote.
During the presidency many important summits took place.
We have in Mr Barroso the ideal candidate.
Only now has the EuropeanÂ Union become genuinely European.
Such a Union is a disgrace.
Changes must be introduced at the earliest opportunity.
He referred to OldÂ Europe and NewÂ Europe.
Welcome.
I thank you, Taoiseach and Minister Roche.
We were very proud of your Irish presidency.
That is a pity.
Thank you, Mr President.
This is the EU that we will work towards.
This presidency was characterised by enthusiasm and diplomacy.
We have had the Irish presidency.
We have shared our Taoiseach with the world.
There is more to do.
Now bring your energy home.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
In doing that, Ireland has written history.
We will see decisive improvements.
It also gives the EU a capacity to act.
That is what our task will be now.
...
We believe that the Constitution is a mistake.
I do not think that has happened.
Europe could have chosen a better way.
I feel that we have missed an opportunity.
Parliament stated that the agreement infringes EuropeanÂ Union legislation.
This leads me to a question.
The work on the Constitution was thoroughly positive.
I think that this is a great pity.
Why is a country large or small?
Â Â  .
He and some others mentioned the issue of Christianity.
Mr Katiforis led the working group on Social Europe.
We have been doing that for 17 years.
This is the European people's Constitution.
We must remind our citizens of that fact.
We are proud that we have done that.
We enlarged to 25 Member States.
We have agreed a Constitution.
We have reinforced our relationship with our global partners.
I wish you well too, Mr President.
Thank you all for your attention.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Mr Ahern and his team have performed wonders.
What image of Europe do they represent?
One work shows Europe as a maze.
Another shows it as a tower under construction.
There are many ways of looking at Europe.
How do Europeâs citizens see it?
The Netherlands Presidency is only too aware of that.
They can serve to strengthen democracy.
There is no reason to lapse into pessimism.
A work in progress.
Not perfect.
Open to improvement.
That makes the European Union worth actively contributing to.
They are what it is all about.
There are more new developments in store, too.
This will make the Union more democratic.
The Netherlands Presidency is a link in a chain.
Firstly, consolidation of the Union.
The presidency has a particular responsibility in this.
Those with Romania have reached a very advanced stage.
Membership negotiations with Croatia are to begin next year.
Islam is not the problem.
How strong will Europe be in several decades?
Europe is missing out on important opportunities.
Europeâs innovative capacity is not strong enough.
Let us take one example.
(Applause)
(Applause)
The Union is more than an economic project.
These are threats that we can only overcome together.
Tension sometimes exists between freedom and security.
Neither can ever be absolute.
Human traffickers ruthlessly exploit this phenomenon.
This requires effective surveillance of our external borders.
A place means a place in our society.
This should increase their chances of success.
The world rightly expects great things of us.
Are we fully living up to those expectations?
Europe could be more decisive.
Everyone stands to gain from that.
The Barcelona process must be strengthened and intensified.
Every era is an era of transition.
The European Union is not perfect.
Criticism is good.
Without it, there would be no improvement.
Indifference, however, is not helpful.
Ilma Kaulina does not regard Europe as a panacea.
All the obstacles will fade in time.â
That is how I would sum up our approach.
For Croatia the journey has already begun.
Today this objective is a political reality.
The same concept also applies to our external borders.
With Bulgaria the negotiations are technically over.
This is our true strength.
You mentioned the internal market.
You mentioned enlargement.
You mentioned the Financial Perspective.
You spoke of Europeâs values.
If we want that, we need social stability.
Treaties are to be kept to!
the two belong together.
That is, quite simply, a scandal.
We need a debate on Turkey.
Let us have that debate, openly and frankly.
Mr President-in-Office.
In this you can certainly count on our support.
See you in September.
The theme of this Presidency is innovation.
Another thorny issue is the position of Turkey.
The human rights situation in the world remains worrying.
What is to be done?
Europe must be more visible.
What is so modern about that?
We are throwing down the gauntlet before the debate.
What happened in the middle was not that relevant.
The programme of the Netherlands Presidency is good.
I really mean this.
I think your programme is a realistic one.
Europe must regain a human dimension.
I do indeed hope that it will.
The same is true of the Stability Pact.
It is going to move to the offshore centres.
We know that this is a political project.
We cannot agree to it.
Will this actually be the case in practice?
Thank you.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is suspended.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs Gill.
Mr James Nicholson
Mrs Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl
Mrs Mia De Vits
Mrs Genowefa Grabowska
Mrs Anneli JÃ¤Ã¤tteenmaki
Mrs Astrid Lulling
Ladies and gentlemen, technology has rebelled against us.
It needs economic and social cohesion.
It needs the Lisbon Strategy.
Dutch companies are leading the world in urban planning.
Why?
Let us not disappoint them.
There is no rush.
However, we must begin now.
This is important but it is not enough.
Well, we are facing interesting and exciting debates.
This particularly affects us Hungarians.
We are indeed very strong in this.
We wish you much luck!
We cannot have it both ways.
I would like to sketch out three other points.
First of all, the financial perspectives.
Secondly, the Lisbon objective.
Mr President, your workload is considerable.
I hope that you can achieve your ambition.
Europe needs this.
Can the presidency deliver?
That is the question.
I wish them well in the presidency.
Â Â  .
This is true for a country such as Romania.
I have spoken to Prime Minister Nastase about this.
I have listened carefully to you.
Many of you have spoken about this as well.
Let me first consider what Mr Blokland has said.
Moreover, I understand this wish.
This point has been raised regularly by Austria too.
I have listened carefully to you.
My third point is sustainability.
Which is why this formula has been chosen.
This subject has your interest and rightly so.
You are aware of this.
How does the citizen experience Europe?
I then discern two voices.
That was one sign, the critical comment.
That is what it is all about.
What is the psychological side of it all?
What are the values in Europe that bind us?
Often we have far too little time for this.
We shall take initiatives on this point.
Freedom, solidarity and respect.
I should just like to make two recommendations.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
(1)
That seems to be the problem.
Â Â  It shall appear thus in the Minutes.
I shall repeat the list of candidates:
for the ALDE Group, Mrs Anneli JÃ¤Ã¤tteenmaki,
(1)
Â Â  .
You are the representatives of 450 million Europeans.
We have pooled our sovereignty to face common challenges.
Let us never underestimate this great European achievement.
As Jean Monnet said, ââ
We must build our Europe together.
Words must be transformed into actions.
What we do we must do well.
It will be a great challenge.
The challenge now is ratification.
Reforms are needed.
We must put growth centre stage.
Our social ambition must be fuelled by economic success.
This is at the core of the Lisbon Agenda.
We must also meet the challenges of globalisation.
We must deliver a better quality of life.
I promise you three things in particular:
You are the voice of the peoples of Europe.
It is essential that this enlargement is a success.
Europe must be a success.
Thank you for your attention.
We believe you can do this.
The European Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
You spoke of a partnership for Europe.
A lot of it was wrong.
Are you in favour of sustainable development policy?
Do you advocate an energy policy that conserves resources?
That is the question we are asking.
May I say one thing in conclusion?
One can come close to it, however.
You say you are a committed European.
What kind of pilot would you be?
What kind of plane is your Europe?
What is your destination?
It is like a dream come true.
What a magical transformation!
Another thing, Mr Barroso.
You are the third spare wheel.
You offer us Barroso!
Let us go for Barroso!
We are doormats anyway.
That is what we have to decide.
Economically and socially, Mr Barroso is a liberal.
They are revealing.
Some have described it as shock therapy.
The world needs Europe, but a different Europe.
We really are not up to it.
Who are the members of these?
Who go to the meetings?
Who have their travel expenses refunded?
Why cannot we know these facts?
I am not saying that this happens.
I will allow myself one observation, however.
We want to see stronger protection for whistleblowers.
I congratulate you for the role you played then.
You say you stand for one.
You stress the importance of public services.
The same applies for jobs.
That would be a pity.
The first is the kind of Europe we want.
That is the question we must ask ourselves.
They want Europe to guarantee their security.
That is our duty and our responsibility.
Â Â  Mr President, congratulations on your election.
The Catalan people have not been recognised by Spain.
Â Â  Madam President, I will be very brief.
I do not believe that is correct.
Thank you very much for that.
Thank you.
Nevertheless, they did not win.
We know that the world is not fair.
We can always hope.
You can see that in the electoral turnout.
We want a more ambitious European Union.
Why is that the case?
There are two important explanations.
The Commission must stop continually going into new areas.
This is highly undemocratic.
The next five years will be full of challenges.
Turkish accession is a case in point.
They think it has all been decided in advance.
I cannot believe that.
Put your trust in the European Parliament.
You have taken that step and are appearing today.
I therefore believe it is an important step.
You have achieved that.
We are now in another political phase.
And that is the way it works.
You have put it quite rightly.
We all agree on this.
It is a vote of confidence.
You have said as much very clearly today.
How can we help to make Europe more competitive?
The policy on chemicals, for example.
I might mention the Budget Regulation.
What does Europe mean to them?
You mentioned it among many others.
I confess I am still unsatisfied.
We must implement the recommendations of Mr Wim Kok.
We must have incentives to create jobs.
We must incorporate the most marginal into society.
We will never tire of saying this.
No.
People expect concrete results from us.
Can you give hope to those who lost it?
Europe alone is not enough.
That is my vision for Europe.
That is my vision.
Â Â  The debated is suspended.
(2)
(1)
That presupposes political cooperation in this House.
It is not an impulsive act.
We did not spare you.
MrÂ Barroso, we have the market.
We do not have the policies.
Eighty per cent of public opinion is against GMOs.
The situation has also changed for us.
I should like to ask our President-designate a question.
This is a momentous event.
That will be the first problem he must tackle.
Two crucial issues spring to mind in this connection.
The second economic issue arising is the budget.
We cannot agree to cuts in the budget.
In theory, enlargement has been successfully accomplished.
In practice, reintegration is still not a reality.
Europe was torn apart at Yalta.
That is our first question.
This leads me to the next question.
This latest enlargement was done on the cheap.
There can be no question of making further savings.
Hence my next question to MrÂ Barroso.
The Portuguese have long been renowned as great mariners.
Good luck.
This is Europeâs identity.
You headed the delegation representing the Council in Rio.
Believe me.
We will not support it.
It is not a working language at the moment.
Indeed, they actually advocate cutting it.
This caused alarm in certain MemberÂ States.
It also undermined confidence in the European institutions.
I am extremely pleased at this development.
I will therefore vote for you.
This means standing up to George Bush.
I hope we can rely on you.
You somewhat remind me of your mate Tony Blair.
We find ourselves in a rather paradoxical situation.
It is important that you realise this.
Thank you for your attention.
I wish you every success.
That is why I wish him every success.
I turn now to my question.
What policy on gender equality will you pursue?
That is much too vague and woolly.
You told us that you want an independent Commission.
That is the kind of partner this Parliament needs.
The first concerns information.
Â Â  â Mr Barroso, you have not convinced us.
How are you going to change your image?
Thank you.
I believe that you are just that person.
How might we achieve that?
Africa is, of course, a priority here.
That is the reality.
I am very proud to be a European.
We have our own identity.
That is vital as far as I am concerned.
The Commission needs to maintain that principle.
I am in favour of equal opportunities.
That is the direction I wish to go in.
Your questions relate to a Commission initiative.
There are questions that still need to be clarified.
We are a Union of states and of citizens.
Security yes, but not an obsession with security.
What was Europe like 50 years ago?
What has it become today?
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
It marks:
(2)
My comments have been misrepresented in the press.
The Conference of Presidentsâ proposals are approved.
Â Â  All Members have the right to join a committee.
This right must be strictly respected.
We shall resolve this problem as soon as possible.
The fourth question was...
Even if you had only alluded to this ...
Let me put a question.
Unreliable partner!
Your performance in yesterday's debate was assured.
You heard this House out.
You stood there.
You answered our questions.
Yesterday you delivered these.
Hold to it and you will have our backing.
I love you.
Let us remember what we are talking about here.
Just look at the Commission!
We saw the Eurostat scandal.
Have we really seen an increase in transparency?
But he believes in a political Europe.
The closest we can get to that are governments.
We also know that he is not arrogant.
That is all.
Â Â  The results of the vote are as follows:
Left and right is only one dimension in politics.
There are others.
We should build a dynamic coalition for Europe.
I will work with all of you.
I am particularly honoured by your support.
Our thoughts and our tributes are also for him.
This smacks of nineteenth century capitalism.
I jest not.
It is a restrained request.
There are now guilty innocents and innocent innocents.
They are destroying homes and infrastructure.
Â Â  The debate on matters of political importance is closed.
Â Â  .
Of course we are trying to combat these problems.
We lack measures, resources and money.
That Regulation has not worked.
The Member States act as they wish and improvise.
And neither is there any inter-regional coordination.
How?
We Greens call for a pre-emptive war against fires.
The European Union is capable of doing this.
Words are never enough.
Â Â  .
We are addressing that.
I once again thank you for this debate.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This is already serious in itself.
Â Â  .
This is clearly contrary to our objectives.
Support from third countries is likely to be limited.
That itself is doubtful, to say the least.
We are now facing the same problem.
Why is that so?
Let me thank you again for that.
Let me make three points in relation to this.
I also hope that you will win the day.
Aviation and the environment are not compatible.
Â Â  .
The emissions from aviation are increasingly significant.
The Commission was aware of these problems months ago.
We believe that this is the only way forward.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The corresponding vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
The Secretariat of the Basel Convention was also informed.
Exports of waste for disposal are prohibited.
This problem should have been prevented at source.
What has the European Commission done?
Secondly, I am a Euro-sceptic.
Â Â  .
It is not the responsibility of the Commission alone.
We have to get the facts right.
Thank you for a good debate.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(1)
I would ask you to support the proposal.
It stands for peace and democracy whilst respecting diversity.
The Unionâs legitimacy springs from two sources.
This Parliament now brings together 25Â parliamentary traditions.
Terrorism of all kinds is to be condemned.
No analysis equates to justification.
This has become known as relocation.
These two aims ought to be complementary for us.
This is all more complicated than it appears.
I shall refer to these later.
Romania and Bulgaria will soon be represented here too.
It will be some time before the situation improves.
A unanimous decision in Council is required.
Parliament must strive to become a genuine European assembly.
The House will liaise with the national parliaments.
I invite you all to play your part.
The House must prove it to the world.
All these issues will be raised.
That relationship involves Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine.
The 2007-2013 financial package contains more than budgetary proposals.
It is much more than a budget.
The plenary is to decide on this today.
All its details need careful consideration.
This probably calls for a focused debate.
Special attention must be paid to transatlantic relations.
That so-called European dream has now come true.
I believe Parliament must engage in this endeavour.
That is something that will have to change.
You spoke about our relationship with the Commission.
That is something we will have to argue about.
Let me tell you what our main task is.
The best of luck to you!
You must make sure that it does.
The first is in reform of this House.
An enlarged Parliament means a reformed Parliament.
We cannot hide behind it.
We certainly have to make great improvements in-house.
All these things featured in your speech.
The voters have spoken.
We respect their decisions.
We should understand the reasoning behind this approach.
If not you, then who?
Who shall speak for the downtrodden and the unjust?
If not you, then who?
Who shall speak for you?
If not you, then who?'
Â Â  Thank you Mr President.
But in Slovakia we believe in clearing the air.
You are faced with trying times.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs BelohorskÃ¡.
Moreover, we have committed ourselves to doing so.
These are our friends.
Freedom of expression is minimal.
There is extensive trafficking in women.
The official pressure must be intensified.
Belarus is a state in an exceptional situation.
We were not elected to set Europe against itself.
Is the European Union competent to reprimand independent states?
Where is the democracy in such cases?
Pharisees and hypocrites!
It is not Parliamentâs job.
Parliament should therefore not overstep its competences.
This is not prejudice, these are facts.
Media outlets in Belarus are being closed down.
This is not prejudice.
Human rights and democratic freedoms must be constantly emphasised.
The situation in Belarus is becoming ever more grave.
He may be hoping to become president for life.
Organised crime is low.
Nevertheless, no one actually disputes his victory.
Our appeal must be one of goodwill.
This shows that double standards do not apply here.
Various speakers have indicated the way forward.
What impact can the European institutions have in Belarus?
It is certainly a long-term effort involving many risks.
Thank you for your attention.
Unquote.
Thank you for your attention.
That difference is certainly worth remembering.
Official ideology rules in the country.
This is a paradox!
It is our duty.
That is unacceptable from a democratic point of view.
So let us see things as they really are.
Are there any funds?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
The second great priority is security and European citizenship.
The Commission intends to continue working in this direction.
A decision has already been made on this issue.
I would ask you to respect them.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Is it because of the Stability Pact?
Is it due to a lack of political will?
Â Â  .
Indeed, the remaining Member States cover the shortfall.
Â Â  I am abstaining from voting on this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  We are abstaining from voting on this report.
Â Â  .
Thank you for your cooperation.
There is much else that we should be doing.
Let me conclude by congratulating each and every Commissioner.
Is that, though, what he wanted?
There is no alternative.
All these matters, of course, are interconnected.
Secondly, sustainable development is an important issue.
We must make room for this in 2005.
We are all in agreement on this.
We will have to wait and see.
The honourable Members will be very active here.
Well, this is possible.
And anyway things can always be improved.
That is something we cannot forget.
No.
I am in favour of the Protocol.
I support the reduction of greenhouse gases.
Time is passing and the urgency is clear.
No, it is not.
Europe alone is not enough.
The brain drain.
We have stopped attracting intelligence, innovation and research.
That is the key for the future.
This Parliament also has to give its opinion.
I wish you every possible success in the future.
The debate is closed.
(1)
We must avoid overestimating the level of payment appropriations.
The resulting appropriation corresponds to the expected implementation level.
I assume that they are a sound basis.
Â Â  .
No changes can therefore be made to commitment appropriations.
All these issues must be taken into consideration.
I am also optimistic with regard to administrative expenditure.
Further debate will be necessary on this issue.
Â Â  .
Secondly, the situation of the agencies.
Thirdly, the issue of payment appropriations.
We each look after our own budget.
The same is true for structural policy.
Has poverty died out?
Are there no more problems?
I do not think so.
That has not yet happened.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Now let us move on to the next speaker.
This would not allow us to meet new challenges.
This budget is a step in that direction.
The special exemptions that exist must be removed.
Thank you for your attention.
The initial proposal of the European Commission was well-founded.
The proposal is therefore very stringent.
Five billion!
Social needs are beginning to make themselves felt.
There is more.
This is a setback in my view.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the legal protection of designs.
Â Â  .
Potentially that market is worth billions of euros.
We are talking here about the repair market.
Thirdly, Europe's competitiveness would benefit.
The lack of harmonised rules is burdensome for companies.
Fourthly and finally, a remark on safety.
Design protection covers only the outward appearance of products.
They set objective minimum standards for all spare parts.
All producers would continue to have to respect these.
Â Â  .
It gives me pleasure to reply to MrÂ Harbour.
Let me deal first with the question of safety.
Â Â  .
So we can rest assured on that score.
In another context you spoke of impact assessments.
Â Â  .
That is what we have done today.
The second point refers to employment.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
As a result research is not carried out.
Nevertheless, we have taken action.
We are all looking forward to the new treaty.
That is the question.
Could you give any examples?
This will, therefore, change everything.
We have no legal basis in this field.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
There will be no generic approvals.
Unfortunately, we are not talking about unfair competition.
Farmers may choose to use them or not.
They can use any of the varieties.
I have a second question.
That is the reality.
That is not enough, however.
I have met all the sectors.
I am not declaring war on anybody.
We were, however, discussing all the issues.
I am told we can continue to talk.
We can always carry on talking.
So there have certainly been consultations and talks.
Is she taking account of the workers' proposals?
None of that has happened.
What has happened?
The opposite: unprecedented dynamism in European airports.
I therefore believe that these concerns are unfounded.
We have further questions now for the other Commissioners.
The second element is conquering foreign markets.
Â Â  There are, of course, several levels.
Â Â  .
The elimination of poverty amongst children is also emphasised.
It is encouraging.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The relevant case law exists for such action.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Sixth, provision of humanitarian assistance.
The EU is fully behind the African Union.
The African Union has taken two major initiatives.
Secretary-General Annan visited Sudan in July.
The United States supports this line also.
Finally, the way forward.
Â Â  .
They have to initiate and drive this mission.
This is a must.
There is more to this than some disorganised violence.
What are the points to be discussed?
The first is the ethnic context.
There is massive sexual violence.
This should be stopped immediately.
They were very clear and very adamant on that.
They are contravening the no-fly zone.
The pattern of violence must stop.
This adds up to a situation of enormous fragility.
That would leave 1.2Â million people facing starvation.
Most of these are children.
We agree that the surrounding world must act immediately.
It is important to bear two principles in mind.
This would be in danger of weakening international law.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
That is simply an intolerable situation.
That is not the case at the moment.
Many aid agencies are working in very difficult situations.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr President.
It demands immediate action.
It is the world's largest current humanitarian crisis.
The crisis could lead to a further genocide.
Every day the situation worsens.
The cease-fire agreement should be respected.
The EU will probably follow suit.
Â Â  .
We must lend all the support we can muster.
We have to be willing to take action.
Â Â  .
This needs to be supported.
We need to do more.
The UN's role is absolutely essential.
What can we do to exert maximum pressure?
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(2)
Â Â  .
It is a threat that we cannot neglect.
We need to protect our citizens better.
There are no quick fixes for terrorism.
But here, we have to be cautious.
The UN is at the core.
We have also been active as regards external policy.
I turn now to the presidency programme.
That brings me to terrorism in Russia.
This gives rise to concern.
Â Â  .
Attacks on civilians are always contemptible.
Dialogue inevitably involves questions.
Who were those involved?
What provoked the storming of the school?
Why was the number of casualties so high?
However, the link with Chechnya is clear.
Many civilians have simply disappeared.
This is a time of grief and shock.
That is what partners do.
He was giving a judgment on the security barrier.
That is true.
So should we.
It was appalling â a community that exported gangsterism.
The European institutions are alive to the problem.
Nobody speaking in this debate can banish these images.
It is this.
We abominate and condemn it without reservation.
Who is actually behind the aircraft crashes in Russia?
Who made human beings into monsters?
History has taught us what colonial wars are like.
Colonial wars bring forth barbarians.
Nothing.
Putting them through hell does indeed beget monsters.
Vladimir Putin gained power by promising to restore order.
Ariel Sharon promised his people security and peace.
It is not just an emerging problem.
Terrorism is essentially about fear, it generates fear.
We must endeavour to comprehend the incomprehensible.
Why is this so?
What happened?
What has come to pass?
How are these facts to be denied?
Think about it, Mr Bot.
This act of terror can have no justification whatsoever.
That is not easy.
Terrorism is wrong wherever it occurs.
There is no justification or room for equivocation.
We can no longer afford this.
Have fine words meanwhile been translated into action?
I headed a parliamentary delegation to Chechnya last year.
The Russian Government stated that it would act accordingly.
This is a matter of joint concern.
There is a great deal more going on.
In Chechnya, a messy war is being fought.
A military solution is not possible.
Unquote.
For them that anachronistic colonial war was long over.
When will it end however?
That is a dead end.
Thank you for your attention.
Let me briefly explain my own judgment.
We have heard something of that this morning.
What is to be done?
This is a dangerous mixture that threatens us all.
Russia has to recognise who her real friends are.
These are not ordinary Chechens ...
What we need instead is ...
It was a nerve-wracking experience for both of us.
I cannot imagine the ordeal suffered by those children.
Those are the undeniable facts.
I have mentioned a few measures.
How can we fight terrorism jointly?
What are the means at our disposal?
How can we pool our information more effectively?
I do not believe that to be the case.
The debate is closed.
I will return to their findings in a moment.
Our thoughts are with the victims and their relatives.
Clearly, this situation is currently not good.
First of all, police training.
Resolution 1546 provides for this.
Â Â  .
I have enjoyed coming here.
Other evidence also speaks eloquently for itself.
As someone once said, 'stuff happens'.
Is global terrorism in retreat?
I simply pose the questions.
Honourable Members will have their own answers.
If Iraq goes badly, we all suffer.
How could I?
All done and dusted then?
Sighs of relief all round?
I do not seek to take sides.
America elects its President and its Congress.
The rest of the world looks on.
What are we to make of all this?
American and European citizens deserve better, too.
It is now time to take a different road.
Everything else in Iraq depends on stopping the killing.
But Iraq needs more than money.
Iraq presents us with a challenge.
So where do we stand today?
Who in Europe does not want the hostages freed?
That is indeed what we must do.
I pray now for the release of all hostages.
No stone should left unturned to achieve this objective.
Let me turn to the second confusion.
Iraq is in just that condition today.
It is a possibility.
We should help Iraq build a peaceful society.
What is NATO doing?
What is the European Union doing?
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President, Commissioner Patten.
Â Â  We now come to the vote(1).
That concludes the voting.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Invariably it is meaningless.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Last Sunday, 600 attacks of this type occurred.
Mr Bot said that Iraq is a divisive issue.
I see no political realism.
The terrorist presence cannot hide that fact.
What is the role of the United Nations today?
To maintain world order we need a revamped UN.
However, I fear that they cannot be implemented.
This is a view that I readily support.
The Dutch Presidency will ensure that this is done.
I have clearly set out those goals.
Â Â  âThe debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
Let us fight to ensure that positions of this ...
Are there any comments?
In fact, of course, none were permitted.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Tannock.
Â Â  .
The discussion was based on three papers.
The discussion was held in two parts.
We think the following elements should be analysed.
The focus on these elements should be enhanced.
Â Â  .
How can this be done?
By means of two possible procedures.
There is a trade-off here.
There is only âeither/orâ.
The reality is rather different.
That is what has come to pass.
Budgetary consolidation cannot be an end in itself.
Public investments secure the future and employment.
One would not expect them to.
A flexible rule ceases to be a rule.
Let me end on a positive note.
I thank you for your attention.
May I ask you something?
This is the time for you to do so.
The discussion should be structured around three key points.
There is still a need for unambiguous sanctions.
Here there is much to be done.
This wall has to be broken down.
I wish you good luck!
So let us wait a little.
What Germany needs are major structural reforms.
Thus we wish our colleagues in the eurozone well.
The euro is an ambitious project.
They are in essence a surrender to political might.
Borrowing must be restricted solely to productive investment.
The Pactâs strength lies in its simplicity.
Why not try out the golden rule?
That would be a mistake.
The Commissionâs proposals are sound.
Â Â  .
I have many obligations to fulfil.
I am not surprised by that.
Maybe we can reach some consensus here.
Let me pick out a few themes.
I think that is an important consensus.
That is my experience, at least.
We must be consistent during the entire cycle.
We also have the Lisbon process.
Mr Schulz spoke of this tension.
They may even conflict with the Lisbon objectives.
There were some questions about the golden rule.
He will be President of the Euro Group.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Almunia has interpreted Shakespeare brilliantly.
What we were saying yesterday is still true today.
I see that as a very important criterion.
A source of friction would have thus been eradicated.
It is a symbol which needs rehabilitating.
We start from a most regrettable situation.
Â Â  .
And how must we do this?
With more flexibility or more rigour?
With both things.
Does this require a debate?
The Commission believes this is obvious.
Should this debate take place within a certain limits?
I believe this is absolutely essential.
What action are we going to take?
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
- to the Council:
- to the Commission:
Â Â  . Thank you Mr President.
How can it be harmful?
These procedures are national.
They are matters for national and internal debate.
That is up to them.
It would make the debate more European.
This debate is myth against reality.
What action is the Commission taking?
What action is the Commission taking?
Our position is clear.
I would urge all Members to support this resolution.
Secondly, there should be a timetable.
And there are only two ways of doing this.
France recently gave us a lamentable example of this.
This is the thrust of this proposal.
However, the word is empty without the reality.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
I would like to raise three issues.
It is in our interests.
The Constitution is alive.
It does not end with its approval.
On the contrary, it starts with its application.
It gives our citizens rights.
As a joint operation, Europe requires joint mobilisation.
We are entering a new political era.
Three years later, there was Sedan.
I will of course abide by your rules.
Many Members have given voice to this concern.
We are not impartial towards that Treaty.
Why?
The Commission is imposing no restrictions in this respect.
So let there be no misunderstandings on that front.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Ladies and gentlemen, this debate is now closed.
The next item is questions to the Council.
This is unacceptable.
We shall examine a number of questions.
We insert human rights clauses in external agreements.
I have a number of supplementary questions.
How will the Council monitor the situation?
I would welcome your response, Mr NicolaÃ¯.
I urge you to take this issue very seriously.
My question addressed precisely this point.
You gave no reply.
Moreover, the means are there.
We lead the world.
That concludes Question Time.
()(2)
Again, this does not happen in Portugal.
Why is this so?
Is womenâs health threatened by an epidemic?
I myself can be brief about this.
Is the European Commission of the same mind?
Does the European Commission share his opinion?
Information activities are not violent.
Â Â  .
Â Â  This debate may be divided into two parts.
The exemption invoked is that of national security.
Such a situation would clearly be unacceptable.
This is not what we are debating.
No.
No.
This is what we are debating.
Unfortunately, however, it can become a grave.
This issue seems to me to be completely clear-cut.
They must never be forgotten!
According to the agenda, the boat is Dutch.
I also consider this action to be irresponsible.
The boat then leaves again a few moments later.
Countries think differently about matters such as abortion.
I am all in favour of that.
This extends to Irish ships.
We must now side with women and children.
Abortion is not permitted in Poland either.
Clearly, Portugal did not act under Community law.
This point has already been made.
Portugal is a sovereign state with independent courts.
It is also offensive.
Our laws are the fruit of our democracy.
This is ridiculous.
This is ridiculous.
Should we have them arrested?
Should we close the borders?
Should we keep them under constant European Army surveillance?
Anyone would think that the Portuguese were ill-informed yokels.
We need to be very clear on this.
This is what we are about.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
That is fundamentally what this is about.
It is about choice.
It is about informed choice.
What happens then?
I have heard religion mentioned.
I am very sad.
This issue goes to the heart of Europe.
Â Â  .
This decision is the subject of a further appeal.
Â Â  I thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The EU is a major legal market.
I have an open position on this.
Â Â  .
I agree with its recommendations.
Certain protected species have begun to recover.
Now, however, the phrase is apt.
We are the dominant species.
This is how mankind now manages the natural order.
The pity is that we are terrible managers.
Trade in its parts must be curtailed.
Legal trade in species is an enormous market.
Why?
The first concerns the issue of secret ballots.
That is my first question.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wholeheartedly endorse this resolution.
We cannot allow this to happen.
We have to highlight it.
This is an opportunity to do so.
Â Â  .
Mrs Auken mentioned sea turtles.
We can now give this proposal our unqualified support.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(1)
(2)
(3)
These elements were part of the agreement.
I see that other Members have asked to speak.
I have made a note of this.
However, I would like to add another point.
Paragraph three must therefore be amended as well.
Â Â  Â âÂ There is no problem.
I can provide full reassurance on this point.
Â Â  Mr President, my point is purely procedural.
Â Â  Â âÂ That is clear.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Aviation has long been a privileged industry.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Nonetheless, I had to abstain.
That is why we are voting against the resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That question cannot be shelved.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
On what is this consensus based?
We do not feel that we are so isolated.
Â Â  .
Fortunately they were rejected.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .Â âÂ That concludes the explanations of vote.
(4)
Â Â  The next item is the topical and urgent debate.
We do not believe this invitation to be appropriate.
All we have heard from ASEAN is mild rebuke.
The EU does not put pressure on them.
There is widespread violation of human rights.
His possessions were confiscated and he was imprisoned.
Thailand is a case in point.
Finally, Burma has been mentioned.
Moreover, its problems are historical.
Money comes from foreign business and investment.
Sanctions that would bite have never been strictly applied.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
This is a fundamental political question.
Thank you.
Is there anything more shocking or terrifying than this?
Equally shocking are the texts of anti-Hungarian graffiti.
Let us help them to stay in their homeland.
We have all seen the tragic consequences.
I am therefore firmly opposed to this resolution.
Why?
Such a development could easily become a chain reaction.
I support the resolution proposal.
The parallel he has drawn is faulty and deceptive.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
We have let it be.
They have been living under a dictatorship.
There have been no elections.
The President runs the country as his private property.
Where does the money go?
Who collects it and where is it banked?
Others have been held in prison without charge.
Then we can talk.
We want to help them.
That is not my information.
Wisely, these brochures keep silent about the rest.
This is an outright disgrace.
Â Â  .
The EU has already reacted strongly.
The President was clearly stung by these statements.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote on:
(1)

(3)
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs McCarthy.
So, that letter has been sent.
I thank you for suggesting we should do so.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr De Rossa.
Parliament has started to buy Fair Trade products.
I hope that you will support this initiative.
However, there are wider issues here.
We must not facilitate that process.
Â Â  That concludes the speeches on matters of political importance.
Now we have reached the end of the story.
I shall mention just a few examples.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
Yes, they have been truly historic.
Your Commission began the work of internal reform.
You inherited a Commission badly scarred by scandal.
Your successor will do well to do the same.
But there was no immediate initiative.
Finally, Mr President, the PNR affair.
I am calling a policy into question.
It is the direction followed that is problematic.
The first example of this is the Lisbon agenda.
No, the question is never asked.
Emphatically, no.
What will be the next stage?
The last example is transatlantic relations.
âAllied but not alignedâ was the message.
Thereâs the rub, Mr President.
Alternative options are never discussed.
I accompanied MrÂ Buzek as Minister for European Affairs.
This leads me to mention dialogue with Islam.
It came from the Prodi Commission.
To these we want a clear response.
Mr Barroso must demonstrate his ability to maintain them.
Your actions have been fair and inspired.
However, that support differential has now been eroded.
Your Commission had the task of reforming the CFP.
In this picture, where is Europe?
It is a crime against the true European idea.
A great triumph for democracy and stability.
They have lost faith in the European institutionsâ.
This Parliament was then in a rather paradoxical situation.
You have presided over a college.
I refer to three of your experiments.
There were also the Sapir and Penelope reports.
Parliament had given you its almost unanimous approval.
We have been deeply saddened by this.
This has been a great achievement.
We are now acquiring and constructing Trans-European energy networks.
I wish the Members of the Commission well.
Â Â  .
Why?
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
How can we stop it?
How can we stop this violence from continuing?
It has been impossible.
Everybody knows this.
We cannot accept that way of working in politics.
The first is security.
We are prepared to do so.
Secondly, reforms.
Thirdly, actions of an economic nature.
I hope that they have been of some use.
I certainly hope they have not done any damage.
Innocent children for innocent children.
We must insist that those points are respected.
Even then it would be unwise to expect miracles.
That is the only way to end the conflict.
This Union has done far more than anyone else.
Let me make one obvious point.
What must now happen in the coming weeks?
Commissioner Patten, you referred to Hecuba.
It also involves committing ourselves to the two-state model.
I do not believe he is.
They cannot put an end to the killing.
That takes courage on both sides.
We are currently facing a new situation.
This proves that the conflict has escalated.
How are we to react to this?
Neither of these approaches would be right.
We are constantly discussing great plans and road maps.
He went on to give us the correct answer.
This policy must be rationalised.
The Presidency has produced good work so far.
Something had to happen.
Occupying.
But can we really only make appeals?
It is these voices to which we should listen.
What can we do?
Our powerlessness is combined with anger.
There are many of us who travel to Palestine.
For the reality is very tough.
We have practically reached rock bottom.
Gaza is another point at issue.
Double standards?
Ineffectiveness?
Yes, in my view, yes.
And I believe we have heard quite enough speeches.
The Palestinians are still waiting.
How long must they wait?
I regard them as well balanced and right.
Â Â  .
That is why we are working in that direction.
Will there be sufficient votes to do so?
That is what we would call rationality.
The irrational approach would take a different view.
Unfortunately, we have seen this on numerous occasions.
We politicians must continue to support rational actions.
I would like to say just three more things.
We do not belong to charitable organisations.
We have spent five years together.
We will not forget you.
We condemn those fuelling Israeli aggression.
Condemnation in word only is hypocrisy.
Â Â  .
It is working very well.
The OECD has a role to play there.
This is going to be more difficult.
But in any case they have to be resolved.
We have a relationship with the three countries.
Here we are.
We are friends of Georgia.
Â Â  Madam President, let me briefly address three questions.
First of all, Georgia's achievements.
How have we helped since November last year?
It went very well.
That has been widely supported throughout the House.
What are the challenges that lie ahead?
It has been a pleasure to work with him.
That is the principle of European openness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
He has been a great success as a Commissioner.
That is a serious and legitimate question.
This is a huge problem for us.
It continues to advance and is difficult to halt.
You will soon be meeting President Putin.
My friend MrÂ Wiersma talked about this.
Â Â  . Thank you, Mr President.
The latter is crucial.
I shall add just three brief points.
My second point concerns the question of priorities.
Thank you very much.
The Court of Justice does indeed have problems.
Anti-discrimination?
If that is not discrimination, what is?
Even so, the overall outcome is still unsatisfactory.
Let us look at effectiveness.
There is nothing in the report about this.
Where was the European Commission?
What happens now, though?
I thank you for that, Mr Bourlanges.
Terrorism cannot be dealt with in a generalised fashion.
Matters absolutely cannot continue in this way.
They are now free to flourish.
We believe in the sovereignty of the democratic nation-state.
We do not believe in EU style harmonisation!
Little wonder it is the richest party in Ireland.
Mr Donner has the floor.
Â Â  . Thank you, Mr President.
So I need to go.
This was also recognised by the ministers present.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Let us therefore return to the agenda.
I give the floor to Mrs Kudrycka.
I thank you.
What are they waiting for?
What has got to happen?
This situation can change.
I would insist that it only requires political will.
This is the tragic paradox.
What has happened with the framework decision on terrorism?
This is depressing.
Less words and more work: legislation is work.
But that is not working.
But where is this area, I ask myself?
Let this serve as a warning!
Â Â  MrÂ President, I must make an overall observation.
Thank you very much for your excellent work.
I wish you all the best for the future.
Thank you very much.
I wonder if many people will notice the celebration.
However, we do not cooperate enough.
And those rights and freedoms are our greatest heritage.
Thank you very much.
As such we should seek a common European solution.
Â Â  Â That concludes the debate on the report.
My second remark is about the Lampedusa situation.
It does have anything to do with camps.
Goodness knows in what capacity I might come back!
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
We need to simplify the budgetary process.
Thank you very much.
I declare todayâs sitting closed.
(1)
(1)
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
Firstly, the system must be made simpler.
Why?
Which conventions would this involve?
So much for conventions.
Why more generous?
Where will the threshold lie?
This will clearly have consequences for the countries concerned.
Why one year earlier?
I have two questions for the Commission.
Thank you.
My last point relates to textiles again.
Did it make countries poorer or less poor?
Did it or did it not promote industrialisation?
There is a place for that.
This is something about which we feel very strongly.
International trade plays an important part in this.
The ACP countries make use of the Cotonou Agreement.
I have two questions for the Commissioner.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
So, Pascal, thank you, .
She is right.
Unfortunately, we cannot proceed in such a manner.
Mrs Lucas asked me again about the timetable.
I have almost finished on this point.
This is obviously an exaggeration.
Mr Sturdy agrees on the link with technical assistance.
I have finished on that point, Mr President.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Lamy.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
We have promoted dialogue aimed at cooperation.
What does that mean in specific terms?
This plan was received favourably by Parliament.
Mrs Zabel was the rapporteur at the time.
This battle needs to be fought on four levels.
Should children use them?
Â Â  The sitting is suspended for the formal sitting.
(1)
And you had to carry this burden alone.
But many people in the international community supported you.
This Parliament called for your release in many resolutions.
It is a pain that sears through me.
We should be in a position to reject it.
Violence must be consigned to the past.
I make this commitment without expecting anything in return.
They all have their names.
Only the Kurds have no name.
There is no reason to fear dialogue and peace.
We must absorb all of it.
So once again Mrs Zana, â.
It is called money.
In my view it is mainly a socio-economic problem.
Thus, children become objects of dual exploitation.
Today the fight against drug use requires international collaboration.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed(1).
The issue is that of patents on computer software.
Â Â  .
That is the text of Amendment No 1.
(2)
(3)
Â Â  We have voted against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  We have voted against this report in the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
I thank you.
Instead, this is a national concern.
Â Â  .
Ratification process is the excusive responsibility of Member States.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted against the resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Regrettably, many others were not adopted.
They turn justice into a mechanism for legalising repression.
They create an EU-controlled fortress to keep out immigrants.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
â¢ .
â¢ as the basic criterion for applying graduation.
â¢ .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(1)
Â Â  The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Gollnisch.
The Minutes approved reflect what the President has said.
The Minutes of the previous sitting are approved.
Â Â  . )
Thank you for your attention.
Never again!â.
I thank you.
Â Â  I shall do so.
Rest assured that there will be a new Commission.
There were heroes and there were traitors.
Should sexual contacts not be ...
We cannot remain idle and postpone this issue.
Mr Karadzic's book is called .
Mr Karadzic was not present at the launch.
Â Â  I have received 22 requests.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you.
I have a personal question for you.
The question before us, Mr President, ...
Â Â  That concludes the speeches on matters of political importance.
This is certainly a source of concern.
We cannot be complacent.
In many areas further reforms are needed.
We cannot correct that by overburdening the ECB.
This was a positive experience for many countries.
We are also aware that the ECB is independent.
Has this brought us less unemployment and more growth?
Obviously not.
Why are we not growing?
Independence is not incompatible with dialogue.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 12.30.
This does alleviate concerns.
Â Â  .
This underlines the importance of innovation.
Â Â  Has Europe failed as an industrial location?
Fear is in the air.
What, then, lies behind this crisis?
I share Mr Bullmannâs misgivings.
Mr Rehn spoke about research and development policy.
Factory is pitted against factory and worker against worker.
We must demand that companies accept their social responsibility.
It is true that demand is too low.
That is, of course, fantastic news.
The only question is: when for?
What is that other route?
For TrollhÃ¤ttan, this is of huge significance.
The workers must be involved.
They must be actively involved in the restructuring process.
We also need political cooperation at European level.
It is a competitive market.
There will inevitably be changes.
That record was last broken in 1972.
I am sure it can justify those figures.
We need to work together.
That is the message that needs to go out.
We are in a competitive market.
That is the change that is needed.
That is really not the case.
Mr Belet asked me to dream.
Yes, I dream about cleaner and safer cars.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Their rights must be defended.
The situation is very different, Mr President.
Competition must be saved at all costs.
Why has the Commission been caught unprepared?
It is controlling Iraq's oil through the invasion.
You will see huge problems soon.
A further slow-down in economic growth has ensued too.
We should therefore focus on these two subjects.
Living costs increase and poverty deepens.
It is a sad picture.
I would like to repeat three criteria.
There was no full agreement amongst the Member States.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
(1)
I hope this will not be repeated.
That concludes the votes on requests for urgent procedure.
For this I must thank Parliament.
It will also act as the political driving force.
This group will not be a talking shop.
Currently, these directives have a limited scope.
It must meet the expectations of European citizens.
We must prepare for those changes.
It must achieve reforms that foster economic dynamism.
Competitiveness, cohesion and solidarity must progress in tandem.
I appeal to your sense of responsibility.
Our group has tabled a motion for a resolution.
What are our values?
All of this must be borne in mind.
These public figures are here today in our midst.
Â Â  .
We should take note of that.
Parliament is here, as is the entire Commission.
Perhaps the Council will arrive later on.
That is a significant hurdle.
That is a hurdle.
The European Parliament does not form opposing majorities.
It consists of diverse currents of opinion.
This is also about the issue of confidence.
That is the salient question here.
You referred to the US elections.
That decision will have to be respected!
Â Â  .
We recognise that your independence is not total.
Liberals and Democrats will consider your proposals carefully.
The elephant is Justus Lipsius.
The Council prefers this Parliament to be weak.
This House faces a heavy choice.
MrÂ Barroso, that is your first mistake.
We are not looking for a European superstar.
We want a Commission which is able to work.
First mistake.
Were they here when the hearings took place?
No, they were not.
The Council nominated you.
You were elected with a healthy majority.
Then there were the hearings.
Try to tread carefully.
He has got what he wanted.
Thank you for clearing that up.
Â Â  .
Our reasons for opposing this Commission are different.
We oppose it because it an undemocratic institution.
The Commission is the motor of integration.
The Commission is the enemy of the nation-state.
That is what it is all about.
We will be voting 'no' tomorrow.
Let us become the voices of a new world.
Thank you.
You did the right thing.
You have done everything to prevent such a crisis.
You have done the right thing.
Â Â  â Thank you, MrÂ President.
This must be made absolutely clear.
You are selling old wine in new skins.
We cannot accept this.
You did not comment on this.
You have not convinced us.
That is right for Europe and right for democracy.
We cannot support it.
I apologise to MrÂ Buttiglione.
This is something we cannot agree to.
Mr Barroso does not select the Commissioners-designate.
MrÂ Barroso, I wish you luck.
You chose to do the opposite.
That is constitutionally acceptable.
That is unacceptable.
Mr Buttiglione!
Clearly, this is a case of discrimination.
You are therefore inventing the compassionate capitalism Commission.
What matters is that he catches mice.
That is something quite unheard of in other parliaments.
The selection, however, was done elsewhere.
I believe that this team can take office.
This is democracy in action.
Political selections are made first, not afterwards.
There are similar problems in the energy area.
One wonders if it can get much worse.
I for one will not lend the veneer â¦
Are you handling these matters yourself?
This is very difficult for us to judge.
The institutions are acting within their Treaty powers.
Some Commissioners-designate have scandalised Europe with their words.
Some Commissioners-designate are competent and know their portfolios well.
I wish you good luck.
I hope we will demonstrate it tomorrow.
I still have my doubts.
And why?
And that is what you are arguing about.
It is laughable, ladies and gentlemen!
The financing of her party is shrouded in mystery.
Good luck, Mr Barroso.
I agree with him.
I thank you.
That is not an ideal way to proceed.
Replace him, and we shall support you.
So what are our reasons?
I cannot condone your presence in the Azores.
That is of no use to anybody.
And then there is your orientation.
You need to stand up to the Council.
Let us not beat about the bush.
The basic criticism was with Mr Buttiglione.
Precisely for that reason we gave you that opportunity.
There is the new Constitutional Treaty.
The Lisbon process too has to succeed.
We give MrÂ Barroso our support.
There are so many issues before us.
You have our support, Mr Barroso.
You are mistaken.
The problem is not only tomorrowâs vote.
You are mistaken.
Thank you.
The responsibility is yours.
Mr Barroso, our position is clear.
You referred to the danger of institutional crisis.
Is this a positive message?
Â Â  â Thank you.
I would crave your indulgence for this.
MrÂ Barroso has the floor.
It is not possible.
I must take an objective view.
You have sent me letters from all the committees.
In these circumstances, I must find a balance.
I have the greatest respect for you.
The European Union requires a difficult balance, however.
That is what we must do.
I believe that would be bad for Europe.
We set out on this task with much enthusiasm.
Europe then offered us a whole new perspective.
The Union now unifies 25 European nations.
After all, your countries traditionally belong to Europe.
We expect a great deal from this enlargement.
We in our family have some experience of this!
This also applies to the enlargement of our Community.
Success often attracts counter forces.
Rome was not built in one day.
Peace is vulnerable and requires intensive care.
More is the pity, MrÂ Barroso.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  â We shall now proceed to the vote.
â That concludes the vote.
We shall now proceed to the explanations of vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
And every single amendment is perfectly justified.
They are the following:
I would like to talk about pilot projects.
This is not acceptable either.
You deserve thanks for that.
That level seems quite reasonable in relation to needs.
That is something I believe we owe our taxpayers.
On the contrary.
Â Â  .
We are actually very thrifty.
That is clear.
This has to change!
Â Â  .
This is not, therefore, the time.
Â Â  .
They are Amendments Nos 98 and 99.
These in particular are the areas affecting the public.
I would like to highlight four of them.
So far, the Commission has done nothing.
It is very simple.
What a great development!
The Budget itself has become more political.
Congratulations on this achievement!
Why is this so?
There are important and good reasons for this.
This is a quite crucial challenge.
A change is therefore needed.
An unwieldy and costly administration reduces that effectiveness.
That is just not on!
All these things are crammed in on top.
We will look to see exactly what we need.
Â Â  ,.
My group backs these proposals.
Â Â  , .
The first is of a formal and political nature.
The second reason relates to substance.
I thank you.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
It is an amendment aimed at protecting human rights.
Thank you.
This is not politics, but accountancy.
I should also like to thank Mr Garriga.
All of that costs money.
I see rural areas as part of this too.
Many thanks for your efforts, Commissioner Schreyer.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
I thank you.
That is not the route to increased growth.
All that must be discussed.
That is from where the tensions arise.
The Iraqi people have suffered too much.
Many thanks.
We have to stand united, ladies and gentlemen.
This is in no way acceptable!
Let me concentrate on one issue.
The European Union is a self-perpetuating political bureaucracy.
This budget is a gross misuse of public money.
There is nothing nice about misleading people.
We should reject this budget.
In some cases, incomes are being halved.
My last point concerns animal diseases.
These decisions are taken behind closed doors.
For example, my particular hobbyhorse is poverty eradication.
My congratulations go out to them.
MrÂ Titford mentioned the question of funding cultural organisations.
The latter is exactly what we want to happen.
Mrs Schreyer, women can do it!
Absolutely nothing.
Thank you very much.
We are not funding that adequately either.
That would pay for all those agencies.
The 2005 budget is of particular importance.
Â Â  Â Thank you, MrsÂ Xenogiannakopoulou.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
I thank you.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for his answer.
I have two questions to put to the Commission.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Perhaps I could add one point about assistance.
This relates to specifically named companies.
Is that deal affected by the Council's decision?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is unfortunate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I hope that is relatively clear.
Â Â  .
How is this possible?
I am merely pointing this out for your information.
Â Â  Â Thank you, MadamÂ President.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The Commission looks into all of them.
Â Â  Question No 44 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  .
I have nothing to add at this stage.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you.
Â Â  .
There have been a number in recent years.
That is surely absurd.
Â Â  .
Thank you for that observation.
This is not an option.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I much appreciate that.
There is a need for further research into FAS.
Â Â  .
I fully share her concerns on this issue.
FAS occurs as the result of prenatal alcohol exposure.
Â Â  Thank you for that answer, Commissioner Byrne.
It is much appreciated.
Â Â  .
I appreciate that.
Â Â  .
These findings confirm the results of earlier FVO missions.
Â Â  .
Rights and dignity are what he has talked about.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
I wish him well.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Crowley.
I would now like to conclude Question Time.
Â Â  .
There are no such grand ambitions this time around.
That issue has lost none of its immediacy.
Another point of discussion was the common asylum system.
Four subjects will be discussed.
The European Council will also briefly discuss Iran.
This now has to change.
Let me conclude by saying something further about enlargement.
This could give processes such as Lisbon a boost.
The choice is yours.
Â Â  .
Not many.
Not enough.
'Tampere-Plus' also means 'after-Madrid'.
What is the Dutch Presidencyâs strategy?
That was the original aim in 2000.
We come from the richest part of the world.
I thank you.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
Clearly, a choice has to be made.
I thank you.
It certainly does not.
We will not agree to this.
Perhaps His Excellency could elaborate on this.
The second issue is terrorism.
The third issue is Tampere.
We will need to act boldly on this.
How can the situation be rectified?
Which priorities would this involve?
Firstly, completion of the single market.
I thank you.
These figures are appalling.
This is the European Union's most pressing issue.
What nonsense!
I disagree with Mr Evans on this point.
It is a productive factor.
We need to bear that in mind.
Let us maintain the Lisbon balance overall.
Harmonisation has mainly been from the bottom up.
That is exactly what we are doing.
We shall be discussing these.
MrÂ Watson and others made this observation.
I cannot deny that it is a difficult discussion.
Â Â  This is a free country, Mr NicolaÃ¯.
You cannot be compelled to remain here.
The adverse effects are already visible.
Â Â  .
I listened very attentively to yesterday's debate.
I renew that commitment today.
You can count on me.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Barroso.
Mr Barroso tells us that there is no proposal.
Â Â  .
I believe there is a point of order.
Â Â  That is not a point of order.
Mr Pannella, you do not have the floor.
Mr Schulz has the floor.
Groups, Conference of Presidents and then plenary.
We shall meet again in plenary at noon.
Â Â  Â Â Â This is a point of order, MrÂ President.
It is an inefficient, expensive and unproductive institution.
Â Â  That is clearly not a point of order.
The Chairmen of the political groups shall speak.
Mr Poettering has the floor first.
is a strong European Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-designate of the Commission ...
This is intolerable.
You should be ashamed of yourself, you louts!
Mr Kilroy-Silk, please be quiet and sit down.
Â Â  .
So, welcome to the club, Mr Poettering.
That is why a broad majority is necessary.
Â Â  .
Its will was tested, its will has prevailed.
I do not honestly think you believe that.
Our strength is your strength.
Work fast!
You know the will of this Chamber.
We will work with you to surmount that impasse.
I thank you for your candour and commitment.
We shall help you on that long march ...
I think that all of us have learned things.
Wonderful, do it, do it!
And that has nothing to do with ideology.
We say that loud and clear.
That would not have been good.
That is something you need to know.
How did such an unprecedented situation arise?
May their promise be fulfilled!
Nor will they work where the Constitution is concerned.
What is the body we now call the Commission?
It is the engine of integration.
It is now on the Net as an experiment.
The four smallest groups have not been consulted.
Intellectual narrow-mindedness makes human beings petty and arrogant.
Many thanks.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
That is not a point of order.
I believe that everything has already been said.
Compromise is something in which I profoundly believe.
This point is important.
Admittedly, I belong to a political family.
It is a pluralist Commission.
I therefore did what I had to do.
It is not a football match.
That much is obvious.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
This is not a request to delay the vote.
But that is not the case.
We are not being asked to delay the vote.
Â Â  The Minutesof yesterdayâs sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
The first name was confused with the surname.
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks, MrÂ President.
Â Â  Thank you for those comments.
Are there no more comments?
Â Â  .
This will give a further boost to our relations.
We hope India will react positively.
I will focus on the latter.
This is critical to the future of the process.
Economics form an important part of EU-India relations.
We want to maintain that.
The Summit on 8 November will prove this.
Â Â  .
The role of the European Parliament is crucial.
We want to foster progress on trade and investment.
Â Â  .
Our relations with India go back to the sixties.
Â Â  .
I believe that critical scrutiny is needed here.
Â Â  .
On its website it goes a little further.
This report does just the opposite.
The geo-strategic and geo-economic importance of India are self-evident.
Our trade relations with India are also of importance.
I am not only referring to the Kashmir issue.
This appears highly improbable.
There remains a great deal for us to do.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ NicolaÃ¯.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
We are very concerned about these violent attacks.
Unfortunately, the situation is only getting worse.
Firstly, what has the EU to offer?
But how big is this carrot?
This will hopefully be an irreversible process.
Secondly, what negative measures can the EU take?
Relations are already on a very low level.
Furthermore, the ordinary citizen will be worst hit.
So it is I am afraid a double-edged sword.
And that I deeply regret.
Â Â  .
Opposition leaders and journalists have been beaten up.
This offer is also valid for Belarus.
The Commission is committed to doing so.
Â Â  .
And so Russia's responsibility must not be ignored.
This also applied to the campaign preceding the referendum.
This situation calls for a response.
I thank you.
If they can, they leave the country.
There is no hope any more.
Many thanks.
We all know what happened.
What action can now be taken?
Above all, major changes are needed.
Many thanks.
No.
These accusations are, moreover, ill-considered.
We should draw two very important conclusions from this.
The second can be found in the amendments.
What action should be taken?
Â Â  Mr President, dear colleagues.
Lithuania and Belarus' other neighbours have specific plans.
The European Union followed a similar tack.
The short answer to this is ânoâ.
It is time to take action.
Â Â  .
We regularly discuss with Russia the situation in Belarus.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
Â Â  .
I will give a few examples.
The Ukrainian Government has to ensure this.
Ukraine is also an important political actor.
This brings me to the third message.
The PCA will remain the cornerstone of EU-Ukraine cooperation.
Real political parties are coming into being.
Â Â  .
We have grave concerns about this.
According to statistics, this minority numbers several million.
I thank you.
It really is a decision for the Ukrainian people.
We should have confidence in Ukraine.
That would be a step too far.
Everything appears to be either good or bad.
It would simply pose new challenges.
It simply cannot afford to do so.
It must also be allocated the appropriate funding.
We all need a programme of this kind.
I believe we should take more concerted action.
That is not the worst of it, however.
PresidentÂ Putin is quite clearly backing MrÂ Yanukovich.
Yet Ukraine is no exception.
I should like to finish with a pressing question.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
We shall take questions to the Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
That was a positive gesture towards Serbia and Montenegro.
We have the European strategy for the western Balkans.
What is the Dutch Presidency going to do?
The problems are accumulating.
I fear that a crisis is looming.
Violations of the Christian minority's human rights persist.
Comprehensive new legislation is still being drafted.
I have two questions.
Is there some sort of timetable?
How do you view its content?
That is what I want to know.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
Can non-Dutch-speakers understand me too?
Negotiations with Romania about Chapter 24 are still underway.
Anti-corruption legislation forms part of this.
The use of these signposts is compulsory at airports.
Yes, Turkey presents challenges for the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
Thank you.
Â Â  . Thank you for the question.
Is that what the EU wants, however?
What is the Council's position on price rounding?
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
Most synthetic drugs can be produced locally.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
Â Â  Thank you for your answer.
I am disappointed with the answer to the question.
Â Â  . Mr President, I do apologise.
In that case, Question Time is closed.
The agenda says Question Time finishes at 7 p.m.
Therefore, surely, Question Time cannot be closed?
Question Time is closed.
I think I am the last.
Thank you for your understanding.
((1)
Â Â  Mr Chichester, I note your request.
You will certainly be given an appropriate confirmation.
The second important aspect is the Internal Stability Pact.
That time is still very close.
Has the gender dimension been substantively integrated?
For me, the answer is simple.
Through our policy, we are excluding them.
Our agricultural policy is a disgrace to the EU.
Yesterday, Commission President-designate Barroso received a rebuff.
We know too that older women are particularly affected.
On the contrary.
Nor is poverty characterised by gender equality.
Female poverty is not a law of nature.
Nor should it be.
This is especially true of my homeland, Poland.
Without training, no job and no salary.
There is no simple solution.
Wage discrimination is increasing, as is female unemployment.
Who cares?
I cannot allow that assertion to go unchallenged.
You asked about broad outlines and specific proposals.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
With high-intensity sonars, the price is too high.
There is simply no scientific justification for this amendment.
They will not work.
I urge colleagues to reject that amendment.
That is something that would seriously damage the document.
We are impatiently awaiting EU action on this.
That is not actually true.
We know that we have to be realistic.
At the moment, the scientific evidence is clear.
We call on the House to reject this amendment.
We need time to develop alternative technologies.
I welcome what you said, Madam Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the vote on the
Â Â  .
I shall read out the technical corrections.
The comments on Amendment No 137 should be included.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have exceeded the margin for Category 3.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Your request is very reasonable.
The following is to be added to paragraph 20:
Are there any objections?
Â Â  .
What do I mean by this?
(1)
(2)
This forms the basis for the long-term financial framework.
Below is a selection of proposed cutbacks:
- The subsidy for tobacco cultivation should be abolished.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is a good, simple idea.
They fall well short of the desired level.
That applies especially to agricultural and regional policy.
I should like to add one note of caution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
I welcome the concrete steps this report includes to:
Â Â  .
Nor have other minorities seen their problems resolved.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
India has enormous geo-strategic importance in the world.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
For the moment, I shall abstain.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  â There are no further explanations of vote.
That therefore concludes voting time.
These munitions pose a danger to the civilian population.
Our armed forces have fully supported this work.
I urge Members to support the resolution.
Let us not, however, apply double standards.
I would like to add two comments.
These efforts are clearly far from adequate.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
We in Europe regard Iran as a great country.
It is a great country that Europe respects.
We were cruelly disappointed.
But this is almost a detail.
They are leaders with little to recommend them.
It must either be concluded or be considerably redefined.
Has it produced any results?
No, we cannot point to any progress.
I therefore recommend that this resolution be adopted.
The situation is truly intolerable.
We express our solidarity with the people of Iran.
This is also a short cut.
This poses the threat of supraregional conflict.
What image do we have of Iran today?
I think that answers MrÂ Gahlerâs suggestion.
Â Â  Mr President, let me make things clear.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Casaca.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place after the debates.
Are these the standards that we wish to accept?
What are we Europeans waiting for?
The old Europe cannot tolerate that.
It details a string of abuses.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote on:
(1)
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
They have been held captive ever since.
Since then, the situation has continued to deteriorate.
We already have a European arrest warrant.
Every democrat among us should therefore condemn these moves.
Two months have already passed since then.
I do not understand.
This beggars belief.
In other words, it has been acting illegally.
Our message must be clear.
Â Â  Mr President, 14 November is World Diabetes Day.
This kind of blanket discrimination must be abolished.
He believed in a better world.
This terrible accident did not happen by chance.
Let us spare a thought for him.
I am talking about the Castro regime.
There must be no more political prisoners in Cuba.
Compensation has been pitiful, responsibility accepted negligible.
That is our Europe!
Most have been closed down.
Thank you very much.
There is no time to lose.
Adopting regulations does not change the nature of production.
The food risks which have come to light recently ...
That is where our most important values are enshrined.
It is simply heading towards destructive totalitarianism.
A number of questions arise from your claim.
Â Â  .
Arms export policy has traditionally been veiled in secrecy.
In this respect I should mention the following points.
There are areas where further progress is possible.
Â Â  .
I acknowledge that this argument is not without substance.
More certainly needs to be done.
Â Â  .
Where is the problem?
Yes, EU countries have made progress.
There remains much to do, however.
The EU can and must go further.
This debate is part of our reaction.
The second point about regional development is also self-evident.
Tensions are apparent at the level of global politics.
Let me conclude with the economic aspect.
Since then, the world has changed.
China has changed, but not the regime.
China is the worldâs largest dictatorship.
All these people have their hopes pinned on Europe.
No, we must be consistent.
We are all right behind you.
If yes, then which one?
But that would have no effect.
Otherwise the rules will continue to be bypassed.
They will not support that in this resolution.
Â Â  .
Let me start with the sensitive issue of China.
MrÂ Van Hecke mentioned the Dutch position.
That is also the case in other countries.
It is important to be aware of that.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  .
Let us promote political action rather than military action.
Â Â  .
The operation's HQ has been established in Mons.
However, ALTHEA is not just an EU operation.
NATO itself also remains present in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
After that, a military presence can be withdrawn.
It exemplifies our long-term commitment.
Here Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to deliver.
Â Â  .
Only then could negotiations start.
What are we in this House now to do?
Do they meet the requirements?
Â Â  .
War criminals at liberty must be caught.
The Dayton Agreement must be implemented.
I believe that would be a triumph.
Â Â  .
These soldiers are not arriving alone in unknown territory.
They could have done with a bit of sensitivity.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I thank Members for their remarks.
I shall explain.
We have the Deputy SACEUR as commander of operations.
This is in charge of the regional Balkans operation.
I end with a short but important remark.
Nevertheless we will miss Commissioner Patten.
Â Â  .
I cannot add very much.
I suppose that it was chosen for this reason.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
and
Â Â  Thank you for your motion.
I promise you we will check it.
Â Â  .
That is exactly what it has done.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you very much.
We are not financing intransigence.
Â Â  .
Once again, all credit for this.
Allow me to give you an example.
The occupying army is to blame.
The money will be wasted.
No one wants poor neighbours.
Unfortunately, that has not yet happened.
More steps must follow soon.
The ultimate aim must be the reunification of Cyprus.
However, this turns the world on its head.
This is not a 'zero-sum' game.
They are our compatriots.
That is our objective.
We must not forget this.
They should demonstrate the same consideration.
That is the matter I wish to address.
Â Â  .
That would not be sensible.
I wish to make three other points.
It provided the facilities we have used in Thessaloniki.
It has given us a splendid headquarters.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is important for the political debate in general.
Â Â  .
Failure is relative.
It puts a tradable price on global warming.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Modern sustainable technology will make that possible.
It is not easy to be EU Environment Commissioner.
In any event, it deserves heartfelt congratulations.
The EU can commit to this too.
Let us work hard on the remaining 45%.
It is our duty to help them.
Â Â  We are now already seeing the effects.
Profound changes are now inevitable.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
Â Â  .
But we involve them all.
That is why it is ingenious.
It is so important.
I hope that will continue with your help.
The debate is therefore closed.
Â Â  .
I want to commend MrÂ Putin.
I encourage other Member States to follow suit.
Tackling climate change was never labelled as being easy.
But complacency in dealing with it, is worse.
Â Â  .
You have been an excellent Environment Commissioner.
The ten new countries need clear objectives.
Hence my proposal for Amendment No 3.
Clearly, we need to make a complete change.
That too is the background to Amendment No 4.
This requires businesses that can assess social reality.
We must set to it and demonstrate political will.
Â Â  .
This is not the time.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
Firstly the dates.
I therefore have some questions for the Commissioner.
They are embarrassingly close to the Irish dates.
It sees much of this legislation as aspirational.
This is easier said than done.
The ecological value of reuse is incontestable.
Â Â  .
I hope we will meet again soon.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This constructive engagement has remained our position.
Â Â  .
To be complacent towards those who oppress them?
Â Â  .
It was not easy getting Oswaldo PayÃ¡ here.
They are now spread out over the island.
They are faring badly.
Many of them are ill.
I have met many of these people.
That is why they had to be silenced.
That is why they have been imprisoned.
Castro continues to be intractable.
He appears to want to isolate the country completely.
That would be very unfortunate.
Why, then, should we change it?
Let us show them which side we are on.
Â Â  .
The openness of Cuban society is at stake here.
Â Â  .
We look on this with solidarity.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
His word is law.
Just ask the opposition.
I thank you.
That is the question we must answer.
That is what is needed.
Amnesty first, and then dialogue.
This had a very adverse effect at all levels.
We need to be honest.
That is a fact.
That is why our resolution supports lifting it.
They were not listening to Mr Martinez earlier on.
However, we have to be realistic.
After 45 years, changes will not come quickly.
Where has that ever got anyone?
We have to have dialogue in countries like Cuba.
What is Europeâs objective?
The answer is simple: nothing.
What are the aspirations of the Cuban people?
This action clearly infuriated the Cubans.
They were the ones who cut off contact.
The current method is not working.
What about Spain?
I do not think so.
Â Â  .
This really is not the place.
Nobody can give any guarantees.
We should not make it a straitjacket.
It did not make investment growth impossible.
The debate is closed.
The Netherlands is proud of its diversity.
I would repeat that today.
The Hague Programme gives important new impulses.
What does the Hague Programme specifically mean?
Illegal immigration will also be tackled more effectively.
This will be effective on 1 April 2005.
That is what this is all about.
There is no alternative.
Europe must develop its strengths further.
We should not fool ourselves, though.
First of all, Iraq.
The situation in Sudan remains extremely difficult.
We will do this in December.
I should like to do the same now.
Parliament has every right to reject the proposed Commission.
We are facing important issues and important choices.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Governing means making choices and establishing priorities.
More Union means more ability to choose and select.
What is this about?
That would seem to be urgently needed.
Â Â  .
This is not just a home affairs issue.
It also has real resonance for employment policy.
In these difficult circumstances, leadership is indispensable.
The conclusions and recommendations are not new.
No choices were made from the excess of objectives.
I doubt it.
Environmental policy and social policy are under pressure.
The parties are largely agreed on the analysis.
These include security and economic growth.
The Buttiglione affair is an excellent example of this.
I thank you.
Nothing is guaranteed in the January elections.
That is not all, however.
This should constitute the European difference.
We need assurance on this point.
Europe needs better regulation.
We must improve our methodology.
We must ensure that we work together.
There is strength in partnership.
Let us get on with it and work together.
I would now like to turn to Lisbon.
The presidency was also successful in another area.
Finally, Lisbon.
The goal is clear.
This task is not easy.
Why?
Our strength will be based only on our unity.
What does this mean in practice?
We would be unable to object to this.
There is no consensus on this.
Â Â  Mr President.
You have carried it out without any significant problems.
Permit me to mention something negative, however.
We are working under different conditions here.
Thank you.
The Netherlands is learning!
We have fewer than six years ahead of us.
That is the challenge we are facing.
At present presidential elections are taking place in Ukraine.
This is undermining political support in the European Union.
I was in Iraq last week.
We are not a carbon copy of America.
Everyone has signed it.
Is that it then?
Why were you so opposed to a Europe-wide referendum?
I also remember that he failed.
This is promising.
This is our responsibility to our voters.
Thank you.
The painting symbolises sun, warmth and freedom.
Indeed, it meets the majority of those expectations.
Why should this take so long?
This is a worthwhile initiative.
Young people have a different view of Europe.
This coincided with the Dutch Presidency.
We all agree with the findings of the report.
You have got the right emphasis.
Integration.
Not policing.
Their experience cannot be ignored.
Otherwise we are not being consistent.
The first is the situation in Iraq.
The first step in this process must be elections.
Thank you very much.
This, however, is far from the truth.
Let me start with the Hague Programme.
We are working on better decision-making.
Respectful cooperation and co-existence are precisely what is required.
Mrs Lambert and Mrs Zimmer spring to mind.
Is that true?
I have also noticed that you demand concrete action.
We will convey this message to the Luxembourg Presidency.
I think that that was a sound formula.
I have understood your message.
The Constitution was also mentioned.
Legislation is not the same everywhere.
You know what the deal is.
Mrs De Keyser expressed concerns about the Middle East.
This brings me to the end of my speech.
Europe means a great deal to the public.
Â Â  .
In a broad sense, that aspect is education.
Money is also essential.
One per cent is not enough!
We can do better.
We have to consider Europe's image in this.
Thank you, and good luck.
Â Â  Â Thank you, MrÂ Nielson.
You have the floor, Mr President.
Â Â  .
Africa's weak states need long-term assistance.
From African emancipation to African reoccupation.
Not one.
Enough already.'
The Africa you know so well is poor.
It is underdeveloped.
Success breeds its own responsibilities.
Something new, Africa will always contribute something new.
Parliament appreciates his presence.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
(1)
Naturally, we are against.
Thank you for pointing that out, Mr Salafranca.
(2)
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
We are thus voting against the proposal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
We have no objection to this in principle.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
How could I thus not vote for this document?
Â Â  .
We need to ask this question.
Parliament seeks a âfairâ decision.
Hence our vote.
Why is this the case?
Â Â  .
As long as the present situation persists â¦
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I welcome this important proposal and voted in favour.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .I'll be supporting this report.
In 1998 this groundbreaking measure was introduced.
Yet China is now transformed.
Democratic practices are being introduced at village level.
China should be treated the same as everyone else.
Â Â  The delegation chose to vote against paragraph 25.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Has it amended its constitution to extend civil rights?
Have torture and the death penalty been abolished?
Have political prisoners been given fair trials?
Have Uigurs and Mongols gained more rights?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
âThe text of the resolution reads well.
Â Â  .
They do not constitute a change of policy.
The defence of Cuba is the people's affair.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is the central aim of this resolution.
Â Â  .
Naturally, we want dialogue with Cuba.
This is reason to be pleased and hopeful.
How?
Thank you very much.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  .
Now we urgently need to get back to work.
Let me add two comments.
We may not agree on every issue.
We must implement a positive agenda for change.
We must exploit knowledge to promote growth.
With your support we can build a better Europe.
So let us now get on with our job!
Let me put forward three of them.
My second conclusion is this.
The hour of decision is now upon us.
This Commission is of higher quality.
By that we shall judge you.
Â Â  ,.
Tomorrow I believe it will.
Mr Piebalgs and Mr KovÃ¡cs did well.
This is a better Commission.
I challenge anyone in this House to say otherwise.
It has real talent and deep reserves of competence.
Well, today we want that promise in stone.
That is not enough.
Â Â  .
That is much worse.
Â Â  .
Finally, the common foreign and security policy.
Good luck.
Thank you very much.
They are getting a new Secretary of State.
You will have noticed that.
Unfortunately, this has not happened.
Obviously, we cannot tolerate all that.
We believe he would have been a good Commissioner.
What does Mrs Kroes want to take decisions about?
You can count on our cooperation.
You should have been on our side.
Tomorrow, there will be no suspense.
You will receive the formal approval of our Parliament.
There are still nominated candidates with a Communist past.
This is the task facing you and your Commission.
Admittedly, we have regrets.
Let us look at the future, then.
No, apparently not.
I listened to you again just now.
What a fine champion of democracy and tolerance!
Is that the best you can do?
Is that the cream, the elite?
They are a joke!
I do not think so!
Oh!
My country deserves better and it will get better!
The European Parliament is unusual as parliaments go.
Europe and democracy are the winners from this crisis.
Why is this so?
For months you have been advertising yourself as independent.
However, it is a one-eyed, selective independence.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
You did not heed Leninâs advice.
I certainly agree this has been the case.
I hope you will remedy this lack.
We have great reservations about Mr KovÃ¡cs in particular.
We welcome you as incoming Commission President.
There is little to say about this list.
Not so.
Who controls our lawmakers, the nations or Parliament?
The nations' loss is this Parliament's gain.
Or let us take it a step further.
My first and most heartfelt thanks is to you.
For me, that is more than sufficient.
MrÂ Buttiglione was the scapegoat.
I look forward to our cooperation.
Mr Duff will be drafting a report on this.
We must not become a .
You rightly referred to this as positive complicity.
The challenges ahead of us make this a necessity.
Good luck in your new job.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-elect of the Commission.
Europe deserves a strong Commission.
In any event, Europe needs strong political leadership.
I wish you every success in this task.
Our common European interest demands such leadership.
What do we expect of the new Commission?
We expect it to implement three priorities.
Firstly, we hope it will complete enlargement.
This was initiated but not carried through.
We are not giving you a .
I repeat, we are not giving you .
That third entity is the European Parliament.
Of that work there is plenty to do.
We have given you a clear message.
We are not rubber stamps.
I wish you and your college well.
I should like to refer to one in particular.
I wish you all the best.
Thank you.
Good luck, Mr DurÃ£o Barroso.
Thank you very much.
I also want to congratulate the European Parliament.
We look forward to tomorrow.
Â Â  .
I shall start with the composition.
That is what the Treaty requires.
No!
First of all, respect for the Treaties.
There is, therefore, a mechanism.
Having said that, certain comments have been made.
The Member States are democratic countries.
That is not our responsibility.
The Hungarian Government is a democratic government.
I believe not.
That is where the problem lies.
I would have no problem with that.
They will be difficult years.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
I would like that to be rectified.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Toubon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What is stopping earlier implementation?
Â Â  .
Surely moving to QMV will help change that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
As yet, there is no consensus.
Â Â  .
I do not have anything to add.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  .
It is really an issue for the Commission.
However, I understand the remarks.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I have taken note of it.
Â Â  Yes, I have two specific supplementary questions.
The Council is opposed to this.
Â Â  .
Thank you for your remark.
Â Â  You have not in any way answered my question.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is an issue under discussion in the Council.
I cannot add anything to what I said earlier.
The Council is either open or it is not.
Â Â  .
My reaction is the same.
That concludes Question Time.
Is MrÂ Barroso in charge of inter-group discipline?
The sole exception is Italy.
Â Â  .
I have one final brief remark to make.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let us be realistic and clear.
Significant political change is required.
Â Â  .
They certainly have not been told.
I wish to make five quick points.
I should like to mention Mrs Sinnott's remarks.
The infringement process often leads to a judicial process.
Europe is changing.
That was the slogan of the last European elections.
Personally, I am convinced.
In my view that is very low.
I wish you well in your work.
I doubt very much that they could.
Â Â  .
I will be very brief.
Let me conclude by making three remarks.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
I wish them a happy stay in Strasbourg.
(1)
Â Â  .
I look forward to examining it closely.
Let us now implement them.
Point 5 (h).
Point 5 (i).
Point 5 (j).
Point 5 (k).
I am counting on your support.
People understand that.
It makes this institution stronger.
You will both be the stronger for it.
Yet another is the strengthening of democracy.
Some of our Members will not.
We want you to have that freedom.
Today you get your driving licence.
Tomorrow we start on the rules of the road.
A month ago we insisted on something better.
Where concerns exist, this Parliament will be watching.
Liberals and Democrats will be watching.
The independence of these great democrats is truly astonishing.
Â Â  .
Well, let us conduct a human audit.
You could not make this up!
She is accused of lying to the European Parliament.
The answer simply must be 'No'!
Â Â  .
It has lived up to that responsibility ...
I would ask you not to disrupt the sitting.
Â Â  .
Thank you, Mr President.
Â Â  Mr Toubon, please sit down or leave.
Â Â  .
Thank you, Mr President.
Within this House we have a voice.
If not us, then who?
Who will speak for the downtrodden and the oppressed?
If not us, then who?
I hope and believe that will continue.
I welcome this Commission.
I should like to make one final point.
â¦ have affected all parties.
I suspect the latter.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  .
I look forward to working with this new Commission.
I should also like to congratulate the European Parliament.
That concludes voting.
Â Â  .
I therefore abstained from voting on the approval.
Â Â  .
This we regard as anti-democratic.
Â Â  .
This is the real crux of the problem.
I therefore abstained.
Â Â  .
1.
2.
3.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Unfortunately, this has not been the case.
Â Â  .
What remains is the question of subsidiarity.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have no guarantees of independence and impartiality.
MrÂ Barroso has heard our comments.
The changes proposed by MrÂ Barroso are cosmetic.
These few modifications do not satisfy me.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is good for this House.
These are all very positive things.
We will not renounce our true European ideals.
It is at any rate an unsatisfactory one.
We are disappointed.
Europe needs rigour and clarity.
Â Â  We have now concluded the explanations of vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Who can rule the Ivory Coast?
Who can stand for election in the Ivory Coast?
Who can own land in the Ivory Coast?
I thank you.
Â Â  .
We know that at least 120 people were killed.
They have been inciting violence against foreigners.
International radio transmissions have been sabotaged.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
However, Tenzin Delek has always maintained his innocence.
He is no friend of the Chinese authorities.
In short, his trial was a sham.
Â Â  .
This is an untruth.
However, this was not how this story went.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Many were incommunicado, many were tortured.
Dialogue has broken down.
Let us remind ourselves of the key facts.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Relatives and lawyers have no access to the prisoners.
So what is being done?
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The vote will take place next.
The debate is closed.
(1)
(2)
(3)
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
We welcome them and the people they represent.
Those are two completely separate issues.
We have all seen what happened since then.
The EU has not stood by and watched.
I do not want to discuss individual persons.
That way, territorial integrity will also be maintained.
The potential is there.
The first is that democracy must be safeguarded.
Ukraine must remain intact as a viable state.
I believe that we have.
We have done what we could.
Â Â  .
Then the response of most European democracies was clear.
On democracy there can be no divisions among us.
Today we are all Ukrainians.
Our duty is to act.
We should envisage two scenarios.
We should move beyond rhetoric.
What is it we want at present?
Just what does crisis management mean in this situation?
Yes, there is.
That is what this is about.
The elections did not meet democratic standards.
That is unacceptable.
We call on everyone to cooperate in this.
We support you in your struggle.
Good luck!
That appears too irrational to be true.
Â Â  .
Ukraine has become a focus of world attention.
Thank you for you attention.
We should adopt a clear stance on this issue.
There are also things we must demand of ourselves.
I do not agree with that.
Ukraine should be given the opportunity for genuine independence.
Now there is not a minute to lose.
It is our duty.
We cannot compromise where democracy is concerned.
Mr Yushchenko has rejected it.
Ukraine has contributed greatly to democracy and peace.
Now she deserves to be rewarded.
Ukrainians are demanding their rights.
This is the most important challenge facing us today.
We have woken up to our responsibility.
The spread of democracy is our greatest challenge.
It is our mission.
Russiaâs future is closely connected with ours.
They are universal.
On this point we have to remain adamant.
I am proud of the Ukrainian democrats.
It is a historic moment.
That too is good.
Our task is to promote democracy and human rights.
This we have done in the case of Ukraine.
Much will be decided in these elections.
We demand a new second round for the elections.
We have absolute agreement on this.
That is something I really must repudiate.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
More important is the position of a fallback.
What is the basis for your building blocks?
What is the basis for your working documents?
Â Â  .
This is part of the normal process of negotiations.
Â Â  .
Does the Presidency agree with these priorities?
A genuine dialogue.
But not financial perspectives based on accountancy.
My group takes a different approach to these matters.
We also attach importance to flexibility.
That is only fair.
Such re-planning will provide scope for many new initiatives.
A litmus test makes evaluation possible.
We will have to have a debate about this.
That was nine years ago!
Four years or three years would be something else.
Such is not the case!
The first relates to values.
No, there have been no changes.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
My second concern is with the timetable.
I hope that is the case.
This is deceiving the citizens of the European Union.
I do not think so.
Another area of concern is cofinancing.
Some are, some are not.
We are still not performing well, though.
There are also new challenges ahead.
We will need more than that.
I can put your minds at rest.
I am addressing you as President of the Council.
We all agree on how important these are.
Mrs Buitenweg specifically mentioned Eurotax.
We have not adopted a position on this.
Which brings me to my last remark.
The debate is closed.
This strategic partnership is also important for us.
We want to be good neighbours.
There can be no picking and choosing.
Russia should thus increase the confidence of foreign investors.
Furthermore the EU appreciated Russian support on ITER.
His counterpart will visit Brussels shortly.
They took up the whole working lunch.
We agreed on a number of important issues.
Secondly, Ukrainian law should be respected.
I believe this can be seen as progress.
This package was the focus of our negotiations.
Â Â  .
We have nothing to hide.
That is where the European Union comes in.
That is unacceptable.
This should not be the case.
Democracy is something quite different.
Â Â  .
I am delighted this debate is taking place today.
Our relations now require much effort.
They are only part of the whole.
We know the reasons.
What could the Commission do about this?
Instead, there are Europeâs open evaluations.
There is extraordinary development in Ukraine.
It is Ukraineâs hour now.
Thank you.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner.
That is not the case in the European Union.
The Council got it wrong.
The debate is therefore closed.
Â Â  .
This subject is exceptionally topical.
We badly need an information campaign throughout Europe.
Only thus will it be addressed effectively.
Â Â  .
The figures are appalling for orphans too.
And so it goes on.
I welcome the Commissionerâs statement.
There are sound reasons for doing so.
The figures speak for themselves.
So who are those women?
Not at all.
We need the whole alphabet.
Such thoughtlessness is lethal!
These are alarming figures.
IÂ am talking about love.
Perhaps this is why women so often become victims.
They are volunteers.
This is undoubtedly correct.
Let us not forget that.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Quite the contrary is the case.
Â Â  .
We are actively moving things forward.
Secondly, there is the question of the database.
Biometric data must be stored solely on the passport.
This would damage the citizensâ trust.
Â Â  .
In this area we must be extremely vigilant.
I am not necessarily talking about technical issues.
Parliament is being threatened with ...
Â Â  .
I consider the report a democratic scandal.
I turn firstly to its substance.
I do not harbour any illusions, though.
This should imply resistance to such policies.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11Â a.m.
Commissioner, the situation is serious.
That is particularly regrettable in this day and age.
They do not violate the Bosman judgment.
I do not think it is appropriate either.
I feel that we need to address this issue.
Â Â  .
Do not go with the lowest common denominator.
The top professional clubs have to lead by example.
We have to keep up that fight.
We must not condone this.
Â Â  Mr President, : sports and citizenship.
This is a step in the right direction.
Â Â  .
Mr Karas said that self-regulation is better.
Until then we have some time to prepare.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Sorry colleagues, I must insist.
We have two more debates to conclude.
I am so sorry, colleagues.
Â Â  .
Until now we have had no formal requests.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Therefore there is real danger.
That is an approach that I wholeheartedly support.
There is a crucial difference, in my view.
That too, I support without reservation.
That could never be the intention, of course.
Information campaigns should therefore take this into consideration.
It is up to parents to guide their children.
Â Â  .
We in Europe must act.
We have been dealing with money laundering directives recently.
Â Â  MrÂ President, welcome, Commissioner Reding.
I want to pick up on something practical.
The next generation will deal with it.
It has to be protected.
This report goes a long way towards doing that.
We therefore need new rules.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11Â a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
and
There is thus a need for standardisation in taxation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your magnificent brevity.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11Â a.m.
Â Â  The sitting is open.
Â Â  .
This concludes my presentation.
[Thank you very much]
Thank you very much, Mr Fabra.
This means that we can afford to be ambitious.
The 2003 budget discharge procedure has begun.
I believe this is in all our interests.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
That is grist to the euroscepticsâ mill.
We must devote every effort to getting that Statement.
What are the criteria?
What are the concrete measures that should be taken?
What exactly was the impact of this?
Did the Court of Auditors ever analyse it?
What was the precise impact of this?
Was it useful?
Those are all concrete measures that could be taken.
That is incredibly high.
I should also like to welcome Commissioner Kallas.
Â Â  .
It all sounds too familiar.
Well, so it should.
This has been happening for ten long years.
It goes on and on.
It is singularly failing in this operation.
Does this situation not bother anybody?
It certainly bothers me and it bothers my party.
We look for some changes in the future.
It is a scandal!
The first relates to the accounting system.
Changes have taken place over the last ten years.
But anyway, back to my script.
The system should be better.
Well that is quite understandable.
That I can also understand.
The whole of Europe is looking at this.
I have a final point.
There are problems in particular with structural measures.
They are therefore very important for the future.
This makes it hard to control the situation.
Those assumptions have changed dramatically.
There are three things that the Commission should tackle.
Let us learn a lesson from this one.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The third instrument is development aid.
Â Â  .
What, then, is to be done?
Some of the figures are encouraging.
This position is accepted by everyone except the government.
The case of the FARC is different, however.
This influences and even sways many of us.
The same applies in the case of Colombia.
I presume that is still the position.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
All manner of ploys are used.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there is some confusion here.
I shall read it out in English.
That is the only amendment to be moved orally.
Everything else is already on the table.
(1)
(2)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We therefore voted in favour.
This goes to show that we were right.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Long live censorship!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This does not alter the result in any way.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .â Keep everyone on file.
Â Â  .
This decision is therefore disproportionate to its objectives.
- Situation in Ukraine
The stakes clearly justify our commitment.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I will be voting accordingly.
- Financial perspectives (B6-0189/2004)
Â Â  .
Hence our abstention.
Nothing has been provided for in this area.
Â Â  .
A greater financial commitment is useful but not enough.
AIDS is not a distant reality.
Â Â  .
They were as follows:
The June List aims at limited EU cooperation.
Â Â  .
Every day 8Â 200 people die.
That is capitalism: savage and barbaric.
Â Â  Parliament has come to the end of its agenda.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
This is not a codecision issue.
The situation is truly very serious.
Otherwise, we would have to hold a debate.
I trust that you understand this, Mr Pannella.
Â Â  The next item is the one-minute speeches.
In the meantime the acts of violence continue.
Environmental pollution should not be exported.
I want to make that very clear.
That field is in Auchy-les-Mines in northern France.
Â Â  I take note of what you say.
Camera shy, but terror proud.
This situation cannot continue.
Â Â  That concludes the speeches.
I rejoice that they are.
Â Â  That is not a point of order.
Mr Eurlings has the floor.
First of all, human rights.
A third point concerns womenâs rights.
The report is quite clear about that too.
I have another three points to make.
Last but not least, Cyprus.
The report leaves no doubt in that respect.
The European Parliament must encourage Turkey in this.
Â Â  .
The first pillar supports the reform process in Turkey.
These criteria are not subject to any negotiation.
This does not mean discrimination.
Efforts to find a settlement must be renewed.
EU-Turkey relations have a long history.
Â Â  .
I fully agree with this.
I welcome this.
There is something illogical about that.
Is this a risk you can take?
That is the question I put to you.
That it will is not a given.
Ladies and gentlemen, those are the stakes.
Let me be quite clear.
The report is very clear on this point.
That is the standard we will continue to apply.
I want to conclude by saying something else.
Nothing is further from the truth, though.
Â Â  .
We are all aware of this.
That is enough: we have gone too far.
But we are taking a risk.
That is the reason for our support.
It would have merited greater emphasis.
And that is what the peoples of Europe want.
There are two arguments that they frequently adduce.
That too would strengthen a multi-cultural and multi-faith Turkey.
Are our institutions ready?
Do we have a constitution worthy of the name?
As things stand, Nice is the .
What is the financial position?
Where is the financial perspective?
What has become of the British rebate?
Where is the willingness for real solidarity?
The reality is that the EU has gone stiff.
The Commissionâs report is full of doubts.
Nobody has been able to explain that to me.
Turkey is changing fast.
In that respect, there is no discrimination.
This has brought us to the point of pre-accession.
I will also mention the Cyprus issue.
Turkey is not Europe, however.
Cyprus is directly threatened with exclusion â¦
That does not make it a European nation.
Turkey itself has a shameful history of expansionism.
Witness its brutal invasion and occupation of Northern Cyprus.
Witness its genocide of the Armenian people.
We could talk at length about Cyprus.
This signal will have wider positive reverberations.
I therefore ask him to rethink that point.
Turkey is a long-standing issue on the European agenda.
Its membership is controversial in many countries.
Our common Europe is not a Christian project.
Progress in Turkey is impressive and must be encouraged.
That is not, of course, the case.
These are non-negotiable.
That is no basis for such a dramatic step.
Â Â  What exactly is Turkey today?
What could Turkey be or what should it be?
What is Turkey?
Since when has Turkey been in Europe?
Ask your own children.
It fell.
That will be a crime for Europe.
Do not commit it.
Let us not underestimate the magnitude of this decision.
This is the crux of the matter.
I believe that this is the case here.
Christianity is about being open and welcoming to people.
The EU is no longer accepted by its citizens.
We are aware that much remains to be done.
We are aware of the Cyprus question.
This is entirely inconsistent.
Let us not throw away that chance.
Thank you.
They have good reasons for saying this.
However, these changes were cosmetic.
There have been limited rather than material changes ...
Turkey is important for Europe.
It must give its minorities full human rights.
The EU must also change.
We have no commitments towards Turkey.
That is not the case.
That is extortion.
The Copenhagen criteria apply to all candidates for accession.
The Commission says so too.
However, this message should not be seen as .
To close ...
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Vice-President.
In that respect it is very different from Ukraine.
Trains do not slalom.
They cannot turn round in tunnels.
Thank you very much.
Turkeyâs accession would enrich our culture.
The counter-arguments are illogical.
This paragraph also covers relations between Greece and Turkey.
It is no easy task.
But I believe that we need this.
So what conclusion does the Commission draw?
It recommends the start of accession talks.
That is absolutely schizophrenic and irresponsible.
Why?
This cannot be done by compulsion.
It cannot be quickly engineered within ten years.
We would be digging our own grave.
That price must not be paid.
Let there be no misunderstanding.
I personally hope ...
Others put the cost much higher.
I always prefer to focus on the positive agenda.
I do not share those reservations.
What can be said to an applicant country?
That does not make any sense.
Is Turkey to become a Member or not?
That is not without its problems.
The credibility of the European Union is at stake.
Political honesty means abiding by agreements and keeping promises.
The country is registering high economic growth rates.
Turkey ...
This is a legitimate concern.
Without Europeans, Europe means nothing.
Of course Europe has an identity and borders.
I hear repeated calls for consistency.
Turkey has also officially renounced its Islamic inheritance.
What timescale would he recommend?
No new preconditions, no further delays.
That needs to be said clearly.
If it does not succeed ...
The solution, I repeat, is privileged partnership.
He tried to square the circle.
We Cypriots are not against the Europeanisation of Turkey.
There are clear criteria for accession to the Union.
The Union is likewise bound to do its homework.
For us, it is a matter of principle.
This is the basic point of my short speech.
I believe that this report should be supported.
It is late in the debate.
Under those circumstances, Turkey will be very welcome.
This is something else the Council must consider.
This is indeed one way of looking at things.
We are dealing with a fundamental difference.
This haste could prove to be a big mistake.
External estimates suggest quite enormous sums of money.
Many have expressed their concerns as well.
I should like to conclude with a general observation.
Â Â  .
I fully agree with this.
We are monitoring this case very closely.
This is what we did.
Â Â  âThe debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner Figel, ladies and gentlemen.
Their activities will be coordinated by the Commission.
The report period thereafter will be every four years.
Europass is this initiative.
Europass is a direct service to citizens.
I am very grateful for this flexibility.
The EU stands for openness and mobility.
It encourages and demands mobility.
We should also launch an information campaign.
We also often hear about delays in meeting targets.
But this is not some detailed administrative role.
That seems rather a long way off.
Â Â  .
Thank you very much, Mr President.
I would like to respond to several points.
I think I have said enough.
Thank you very much, .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
It cannot be a unilateral exercise, however.
This is why this debate is important.
Why is that so important?
Their main worries concern the economic and employment situation.
The main question is: how?
The work has already been done.
Economic growth is not an end in itself.
Europeans are also concerned about their personal security.
Terrorism is the ugly face of globalisation.
We need safer streets and a safer continent.
What are our means?
The Union is not an isolated entity.
It is not a fortress.
A number of states want to join our Union.
Europe cannot be selfish.
Now is the time to get down to work.
Something else that is important is the neighbourhood policy.
Let that be quite clear.
The two are different sides of the same coin.
This point is extremely important to us.
The second concerns the issue of impact assessment.
The European Parliament is moving slowly on this front.
Â Â  .
This is an appalling plan.
The main obstacle is Sharon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I will start with economic issues.
You referred to the environment, MrÂ Barroso.
It certainly is crucially important to protect the environment.
Quite simply, they are detrimental to the environment.
Moral values also have an important role to play.
That is not the case.
I trust you will bear this in mind.
I should like to make one further point.
My wish is that that belief should become reality.
A state is a tool for all the citizens.
Let us quickly clear away any misunderstandings.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
Their fight can raise obstacles.
What fine strategic thinking that is!
The Turkey issue is a perfect illustration of this.
This anti-democratic creed is quite simply perplexing.
Women constitute one such category.
We need some serious answers to that question.
I shall now make my comments.
We must stop regulating everything.
The Member States need to regain their freedom.
Unequal treatment of this kind must cease.
What do I mean by that?
The common rules need to be reinforced.
I can be brief about the third point.
Differences in health must be evened out.
Â Â  Mr President, this debate is about strategic priorities.
Who knows?
I hope that you reject this opinion.
Europe needs clear objectives and strategies.
What is sustainable development?
Is it environmental, social or intellectual development?
What are we doing in Europe?
What sort of sustainable development is that?
We have to invest in research and product development.
Take a look at all the statistics.
We can only gain from this.
Does that make the European Union more competitive?
The third issue is this.
We need to create confidence in the euro.
This is something we can do together.
Europe will not succeed unless you do this.
You must succeed and we wish you well.
Such a policy would be inconsistent and therefore ineffective.
The second objective must be the new eastern dimension.
We should be exporting democracy and human rights.
It should encourage democratic choice, as in Ukraine.
Ukraine needs action, not merely words.
It should be offered an AssociationÂ Agreement.
The new eastern policy calls for new instruments.
New challenges call for new approaches.
In addition, we need security.
This trend clearly colours the Doha agenda.
We have to work to make them compatible.
These are objectives that define one of our priorities.
We have a Europe in the process of reunification.
These are the values that define our identity.
That reflects very well on our Europe.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
The debate is closed.
2004 has not been Belarus's best year.
In Belarus, however, it is hindered.
You have the floor.
There was direct censorship.
This was absurd.
We are prepared to discuss that with you.
I will just mention a few of the priorities.
Once again, I thank you for this award.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the formal sitting is closed.
We insist they be returned immediately.
Â Â  This is an important issue, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  .
However, this a controversial matter in the Council.
I hope Parliament will support that.
That concludes the vote.
I voted for the proposal.
I have voted for the proposal.
I am therefore in favour of this report.
I voted for the proposal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Codification is laudable work and absolutely necessary.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is important that this should be the case.
I therefore voted in favour.
We have therefore chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  .
For example, dual parliamentary mandate issues.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Consequently, we are voting against the report.
Â Â  .
I am therefore in favour of their adoption.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  We have voted against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Indeed, the Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended.
I am, consequently, voting in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of this recommendation.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
Section I, European Parliament
Section II, Council
Section III, Commission
Section IV, Court of Justice
Section V, Court of Auditors
Section VI, European Economic and Social Committee
Section VII, Committee of the Regions
Section VIII (A), European Ombudsman
Section VIII (B), European Data Protection Supervisor
Â Â  .
This Parliament will be particularly vigilant next year.
I hope to cooperate closely with you during 2005.
So far, so good.
That manifestly borders on the indefensible.
As a rule, that should not be done.
Â Â  .
I look forward to the signing ceremony on Thursday.
Â Â  .
I thank you for that.
The Council is ready to give its opinion.
We await Parliament's views.
Â Â  .
Thank you in advance.
Such is not a credible approach.
There I would ask you to be more honest.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Of this, EUR 2 billion was new money.
In 2000 there were still only seven Agencies.
These earmarked sums are actually against the financial regulation.
What I see as positive is the flexibility instrument.
That is indeed so.
That I regard as a mistake in political terms.
Â Â  .
Where would such drastic reductions fall?
On the Structural Funds?
A little bit everywhere?
Â Â  .
It pays for poorly targeted overseas development aid.
It pays for this Parliament.
Let us look at the broader picture.
The final figure is EURÂ 106Â billion.
This is also an opportunity for broader reflection.
Â Â  (SK) Thank you.
This creates an impression of competent activity.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
Let me just make two points about it.
This contrasts with similar work in national parliaments.
It is certainly true that Parliament defended its priorities.
Consequently, the quality of administration was particularly important.
The Member States must be engaged in this process.
IÂ believe that we can approve the budget collectively.
Perhaps Mr Dombrovskis will say something different.
Finally, a few words on regional policy.
Why should I vote for this?
Tell me!
Why should any of my constituents?
Why should any of my countrymen?
We are the fourth-largest economy in the world.
Because you lot get the money!
They should not.
No!
Were they consulted?
No!
Were they given a vote?
No!
No, they would not; and neither will I.
We cannot go on like this.
It can be done.
This unanimity also included my country.
Â Â  .
The Council was unanimously in favour of budgetary discipline.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The answer is yes.
Will that not be reflected in the budget?
When will that debate take place?
That is something we cannot afford.
Are there things to be dispensed with?
We must not talk about quantity, but quality.
We can discuss budget ceilings subsequently.
It is regional policy that is the difficult area.
It is quite a package that we have here.
That is fine with me.
After all, I am concerned with content.
Where will the cuts be made?
Show your leadership.
This budget would be based on three principles.
How do you set it out?
I have six observations to make.
That, then, is why we want it.
We want a new neighbourhood policy.
Each objective deserves its own budget.
We should not have to shift funding around.
We are still far too vulnerable on that score.
Equal shares.
A call has now been made for joint liability.
There have already been enough resolutions.
For that reason, European cooperation is needed.
This means a significant rise in expenditure.
That is something I find unacceptable.
That is not something I believe they will do.
Â Â  .
Current Community legislation already includes such provisions.
Â Â  .
On what basis are such charges calculated?
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Piracy constitutes a clear violation of intellectual property.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for that answer.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This concerns a very high-level political decision.
So this is not a large amount of money.
A slightly higher amount is forecast for the future.
You asked about all the costs for the Union.
Â Â  .
That is your opinion.
The Commission is ready to discuss all these issues.
Â Â  .
This is a very important political matter.
Â Â  .
This was decided in 1957.
If not, why not?
If so, why?
Â Â  .
Several different options were proposed.
There will then be an open competition.
Â Â  .
The media works increasingly with new technologies.
Â Â  .
The second aspect is an innovation-encouraging and technology-welcoming strategy.
Â Â  Thank you for your reply, Mrs Reding.
Others were amended or rejected.
Â Â  .
There are already standards for these services.
It is not a threat.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Madam President.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
However, I want to follow this up.
I urge you to take this very seriously.
Â Â  .
This has been going on for years.
The EU provides humanitarian aid to numerous countries worldwide.
ECHO is not an operational organisation.
You mention CÃ´te d'Ivoire.
This has seriously damaged the policy's credibility.
The whole mechanism responded as it should.
I do not question them.
Both humanitarian and development emergencies arise.
The OLAF mechanism is completely independent and works well.
I think it would be difficult to do more.
Â Â  .
Indeed, it is virtually a forgotten country.
Â Â  . I naturally share your concern.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Questions 48 to 87 will be answered in writing.
MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda has the floor for two minutes.
The first of these is credibility.
That makes sense in practical terms.
We need to consider the method of own resources.
That would be a retrograde step.
Mrs GrybauskaitÄ, we are not reassured.
How could this be addressed, Commissioner?
Not all the issues under consideration are being discussed.
An example from the sporting world comes to mind.
The Commission is showing remarkable generosity towards these regions.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
The debate is therefore closed.
The debate is open.
MrsÂ Lambert has the floor.
Â Â  .
What else do we agree on?
Â Â  .
That is also in the EU's interest.
The full support of the European Parliament is required.
That is what the Commission intends to do.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Our actions should be characterised by responsibility and rigour.
We talk about good asylum decisions.
That is bad for all of us.
Poor asylum decision-making is addressed in this report.
I want to register our support for this report.
Â Â  .
I agree with Mr Moraes.
My Group fully supports the report.
That is not the case at the moment.
It is not another path of economic migration.
It gives hope.
Â Â  .
Allow me to assure them of our solidarity.
Â Â  .
The disastrous consequences of this approach are now evident.
This is entirely appropriate.
Immigration ought to be one of these issues.
It must also provide scope for improved decision-making.
I felt it was important to clarify that point.
We must get the policy right.
I also strongly support the amendments.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
That concludes the list of speakers.
The debate is therefore closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
So what is that strategy to be?
We know the connections between drug use and HIV.
It is effective.
Prisons are now multiplying the effects of drug harm.
This is a serious issue for the European Union.
We now need a more effective strategy.
It is a good report which we will support.
We on this side will do so.
What is its objective?
I think we all share it.
This is not about ideology, but about results.
Crucial to our approach must be prevention and pragmatism.
Should we provide information?
That is a risk.
Â Â  .
I urge you to support those amendments.
I will leave it here.
Thank you for the opportunity of speaking my mind.
Â Â  .
It is merely facilitation.
We do not wish to decriminalise drug abuse.
This clearly demonstrates that not everything has been negative.
Is it possible to get rid of drugs?
Shall we give up and just limit the damage?
Emphatically not.
There are high hopes of reversing the trend.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
That concludes the list of speakers.
Â Â  .
What is this report about?
That is extremely important for the consumer.
It is workable, it is a good regulation.
Â Â  .
This legislation will benefit all parties.
These issues make a positive contribution to this regulation.
We are now approaching the conclusion of this project.
Firstly, cross-border trade is of course ensured.
That is fine, of course.
That is extremely important.
I fear that that is already now the case.
I should like to emphasise a few things.
The internal market is incredibly important.
In this respect, this proposal is sound.
Consequently we need to get it right.
This is extremely important legislation.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
That concludes the list of speakers.
Â Â  .
Passports will be safer through the use of biometrics.
First, we will address the situation in Ukraine.
Â Â  .
It has thus reshaped the European order.
Turkey has made further progress in the last weeks.
A clear date should be indicated.
They are therefore reasonable proposals.
The resources must match the ambition.
Let us be clear.
Mr President, this brings me to external affairs.
Interesting things are going on in Portugal.
Â Â  .
The Council will also discuss Bulgaria and Romania.
In conclusion, the Council will discuss ESDP.
We cannot tolerate such a thing.
This House is to hold a secret ballot.
Can you just be quiet?
You may speak after I have finished.
It is a scandal.
Romania will be accepted ...
Â Â  I believe that you are invoking Rule 145.
You were in the chair both times.
Is it not time that you understood the Rules?
Â Â  Mr Knapman, please behave properly.
Â Â  .
Human rights have to be implemented more effectively.
It concerns the following.
I have another brief remark to make.
My final remark concerns terrorism.
Where do you think cuts will be made?
The motto is: strict, stricter, strictest.
Presumably it also thinks that pigs can fly.
Especially for those who do not pay.
We also know that human rights concerns are widespread.
I acknowledge that.
Only in that way can the democratic process continue.
It is scandalous.
That is not democracy.
Should that not also apply to ourselves?
That is wrong.
Would this be a sensible course of action?
Persevere!
I will now turn to Turkey.
Is that still your position now?
Will you apply zero tolerance?
Breaking the fundamental Kemalist taboo is of vital importance.
Current Turkish legislation too is very deficient.
Who wants to hide, and from whom?
Ambitions and funding should tally with each other.
Â Â  Mr President, this has been a difficult year.
Since then we have had the Madrid bombings.
Member States have to deliver on their promises.
We need action, not words.
The same applies to the economic agenda.
Too many people in the European Union are inactive.
We cannot simply write people off as being unemployable.
We have to look at what we do.
That is the goal of this huge European project.
We are also going to talk about Croatia.
Is that right?
Is it responsible?
No, it is not.
We must not take that step.
We have to consolidate our position first.
We have not managed it yet.
We cannot afford it!â
Everyone presents surveys that serve their purpose.
These are the things that unite us in Europe.
This is not yet the case.
That is what the public expects of this Parliament.
That is true.
Mr Schulz mentioned security as one of the advantages.
That is my first point.
There is no guarantee as to the outcome.
Mr Eurlings specifically asked about ways of banning organisations.
Many in this House spoke about the financial perspective.
That moment had to do with Ukraine.
I should like to end on an optimistic note.
Remember that such fear is felt on both sides.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
How can we be accountable to our electors?
Is he personally for or against the secret ballot?
So please restrict yourself to that.
It does not say 'shall'.
Otherwise, this debate will go on forever.
Â Â  You have made a proposal to organise our work.
The debate, MrÂ President â¦
Such requests must be made before voting begins.â
It shall be secret, but electronic.
Having said that, we shall begin the votes.
In Parliament we have adopted and recommended various measures.
Better late than never.
The Commission upheld our arguments in this regard.
We saw it differently in the Civil Liberties Committee.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
This is a matter of principle for me.
May God protect the West's Christian civilisation.
This may well be a good thing.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Turkey must acknowledge the Armenian genocide.
It must give its minorities full human rights.
The EU must also change.
Â Â  .
I voted against this report.
Would this be a sensible course of action?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Such a renouncement is anathema to convinced federalists.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The creation of MRLs on pesticides in food for ...
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote in favour.
We cannot therefore support the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are thus voting against the proposal.
We are opposed to a common EU drugs policy.
Â Â  â Drug consumption is on the increase throughout Europe.
It appears that Brussels wishes to tackle this scourge.
We cannot accept such a policy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It addresses harm reduction, addiction and crime.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  The sitting is suspended.
Madam President, none of this information is true.
This cannot be permitted.
I request an investigation of these incidents.
Â Â  .
Foreign direct investment is at record levels this year.
However, it is not now just plain sailing.
Great changes are taking place on our continent.
My report this time is deliberately concise.
Bulgaria knows the challenges that lie ahead.
Â Â  .
The new penal code still has to be approved.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This situation must change.
The Roma people are still lagging behind and disadvantaged.
The seventh point is organised crime.
The mafia continues to be a serious problem.
Now to the subject in hand.
I repeat, to all its neighbours.
You spoke to us of successes.
They belong among us.
I should like to finish off with another point.
To those people, I have this to say.
Â Â  .
That is true.
That is irrespective of the new financial perspective.
It is important, and necessary, to differentiate.
I really welcome its conclusions.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
This is a long-term process.
Here the Council can decide by a qualified majority.
Negotiations on this chapter have been long and detailed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I naturally welcome this progress.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I thank Mr Moscovici for this fine work.
All the chapters are closed.
A great deal of capacity-building has to happen.
Romania needs its young people very badly.
That would be a very great pity.
Mr Moscovici's report requests an international commission.
That is one outside the European Union.
Perhaps Mr Moscovici and I could discuss this.
I will give you two examples.
What about qualified majority?
Parliament must take itself seriously.
Complaints about election fraud were lodged again recently.
This list is long and weighty.
Today we have a strategic partnership.
The European Union offers helpful precedents here.
From now on it should focus on adopting the .
All we can do is hope.
Major progress has genuinely been made in many areas.
Â Â  Mr President, let me be clear.
We have tabled Amendment No 7 for that purpose.
It might also prove dangerous for Romania.
Is this to say that there are no problems?
Of course not.
I hope that Parliament will adopt the same approach.
Let me be blunt.
I take a different view.
No one can blame the presidency for this.
How soft does she want us to be?
I wish the new Romanian Government well.
Romania's problems run deep.
Candidate countries must be treated equally and fairly.
We have to encourage Romania to bring about reforms.
Structural measures are not enough to combat poverty.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I will be brief.
Let me conclude with my compliments to Mr Moscovici.
Â Â  .
One can only agree with this.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.
We shall consider a number of questions.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
One of them is Interreg.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is part of the pan-European eGovernment Services Initiative.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his response.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This first question is also on another issue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That answer illustrates why I asked the question.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I agree.
Which countries have introduced that upper limit to date?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Research funding is rather a matter of national priorities.
Â Â  .
They have achieved this by running budgetary surpluses.
That is an important point.
Â Â  That brings us to the end of Question Time.
Â Â  .
The same can be said about the European initiative.
Â Â  .
You will always be welcome.
It has been a very complex process.
This is what we are calling for.
I believe that the latter is the right way.
Let me come straight to the point.
Our group has no objection in principle.
Let us return to the initiative.
Of course there is still room for improvement.
This is not a matter of promoting European values.
I would like to reiterate this point unequivocally.
These are just a few of the projects.
Why?
After that, the implementation begins.
Campaign 3 is entitled 'Promoting democratic process'.
There is thematic programming here.
The United States is now doing something similar.
I now turn to some other more formal questions.
This is what I wanted to say.
I thank you for taking it.
Â Â  .
This will be completed by February.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
In recent years we have seen major disasters.
We have no difficulty in accepting this request.
You may say it is not a big increase.
Two, more training for intervention teams.
Increasing the number of volunteers.
New problems require new solutions.
The importance of civil protection continues to grow.
There are sectors in which we cannot make savings.
Can we find out what their effect has been?
Can we have a detailed report?
European nationality thus acquires a specific and deeper meaning.
I succeeded in obtaining considerable financial assistance.
He went through each area in detail.
In conclusion,
Â Â  .
I also thank you for your cooperation.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
This will apply to all journeys.
This is extremely important.
I fully agree with that.
I would like to comment on two more issues.
Believe me, it was a Commission proposal.
The Commission is committed to this.
You know Parliamentâs line of thinking.
This has now proved unattainable in the Council.
Nevertheless, we have taken a small step forward.
I should like to mention two other points.
Â Â  .
This is a very important issue.
Progress has been made.
This trade is worth over EUR 150 million annually.
Again, I agree with the Commissioner.
This is another cornerstone of EU policy.
They might then understand what they have done.
There is no disputing that.
I cannot see it as such.
I shall be more specific.
It amounts to stalemate.
Member States can adopt tougher legislation.
I hope that you do.
We already have a written declaration on journey times.
Satellite monitoring is cold comfort for the animals.
That is what is important.
That worries us.
Will the Commission prioritise this problem?
We hope so, but are not completely convinced.
Does this amount to properly used tax revenue?
One colleague raised concerns about Lebanon.
Irish cattle go to Lebanon.
I believe this agreement has one very positive aspect.
It postpones the most controversial issues until 2011.
This is its most positive aspect.
It follows that it is the conditions that matter.
The regulation under discussion moves in the right direction.
Humanitarian considerations are not the sole reason for this.
Sanitary considerations are also at issue.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Animals are not commodities.
Â Â  .
It is true that Member States can do more.
I agree that implementation is very important.
It has gone the right way.
Implementation is in the hands of the Member States.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This is considered to be sufficient.
Within what limits?
Under what jurisdiction?
That is why I explicitly included it.
Why is there such resistance to its inclusion?
Is it because powerful interests use that method?
People would be up in arms.
Now, this is happening on the sea bed.
The amendment concerned refers to a possible biological disaster.
I shall now turn to the second amendment.
International waters are affected.
It could also act as a dangerous precedent.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
(1)
I trust the House will agree to these amendments.
It is a good thing.
The Vatican itself will have to pay for that.
Â Â  The budget is approved.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much, Minister.
The amendment involves entering the relevant amounts.
I shall read it in Spanish:
(2)
We will not be participating in this vote.
They may in themselves be of quite different kinds.
Overall, I voted in favour.
I therefore regret the rejection of the rejection.
Â Â  Â Â Many thanks, Mr President.
That is good reason to feel proud and satisfied.
The budget for 2005 is therefore a credible instrument.
Â Â  .
That is particularly the case regarding agricultural aid.
That is a paragraph we cannot support.
Below is a selection of proposed cut-backs:
* The subsidy for tobacco cultivation should be abolished.
I voted for the report.
Â Â  .
I agree with that.
I voted for the report, of course.
Â Â  Mr President, I will be very brief.
Â Â  . I have voted against the Papadimoulis report today.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Consequently, I voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  .
I welcome the rapporteurâs recommendations and warnings.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  I declare the sitting resumed.
Are there any comments?
I would ask you to correct that.
Secondly, we voted yesterday on the EU-Russia summit.
Â Â  Your comments have been noted, MrÂ Posselt.
That is also why it is an urgency today.
Life expectancy is now 35 years.
The aim of this new legislation is clear.
That is an extremely courageous attitude.
The count has yet to be completed.
The conditions are in place, however.
This renders observation close to pointless.
The alternative path, bloodshed, offers no prospects.
That is what this is all about.
The sanctions must stop.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Europe has that experience.
So, with regret, I will abstain.
This is what we strive for.
What must we do in this House?
Much more is needed.
Comprehensive care should be provided, and development facilitated.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The vote will take place after the debates.
The debate is closed.
What happened in the aftermath of the event?
The rest went to the lawyers.
In Bhopal, after 20 years, we have nothing.'
Experts must be involved.
Companies must be party to international agreements and conventions.
What, though, was done for the victims?
The ground is still contaminated.
Toxic residues are stored in the open air.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I wished to vote in favour.
Â Â  Your comment has been noted.
Yesterday, we were voting until 2 p.m.
Â Â  Thank you for your comment, MrÂ RÃ¼big.
Â Â  .
Those posts will be merged into a single position.
It merits our support.
We can be proud of our results.
It is a compromise.
It is not a Utopian treaty.
I am confident it will.
Â Â  .
Today it is.
I would like to acknowledge them today.
I am very grateful indeed.
Â Â  .
The Commission fully supports your resolution.
The Constitution modernises the institutional structure.
We will have more democracy.
Lithuania and Hungary have already ratified the Constitution.
The same is true for judicial and police cooperation.
It is now time to move up a gear.
I remain committed to dialogue with the European Parliament.
Our work will not stop today.
In fact it is only just starting.
A constitution needs values.
Our nation states have their own identities.
I think that is quite a masterstroke.
We have many tasks ahead of us.
Â Â  .
The Constitution redefines the European Union.
Europe will not work without strong authorities in Brussels.
But Europe cannot work either without strong leadership.
The prime ministers and presidents must coordinate their campaigns.
That is the question.
It is a European ânoâ.
Â Â  .
So let us have a real and honest debate.
It is their votes that really matter.
That is demonstrably false.
Our Europe is founded upon values.
We want to retain our identity.
We want it to grow and flourish.
From now on, it must look outwards.
Politically speaking, we are in the regional league.
We still have work to do on the others.
Many peoples have longed for freedom and democracy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let me give a few examples of improvements.
Firstly, the objective of full employment.
Only history will be able to tell us.
Some significant progress has, though, been made.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I even submitted a draft of a possible alternative.
There is nothing anti-European in opposing the Constitution.
Firstly, the challenge of a multicultural Europe.
Secondly, the question of minority issues.
This is the kind of EU we need.
Our actions must be measured against that.
This Constitution lays the foundations of a European democracy.
Why does he not mention that?
The whole process is highly questionable.
You cannot make things so easy for yourself.
Is that how we want to win the Constitution?
We will not do it that way!
We have not created a European social order.
European democracy is incomplete.
On that the Constitution sets its seal.
I find that unacceptable.
Constitutions are for states.
That actually sounds pretty feeble.
I consider this approach to be very unfair.
Thank you for your attention.
Citizens will get better protection of their fundamental rights.
Their freedom and security will be better defended.
They certainly did not intend to commit .
Let me give you some examples.
We owe that to our citizens.
It does not recognise our wish for internal enlargement.
Democracy is an optional extra.
It was not even debated by Lithuania's Parliament.
Thank you for your attention.
The Members of this House have betrayed their homelands.
Their guilt is there for all to see.
Does the Constitution interpret these values?
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
He would need to be bought a new one.
The European Constitution creates such a framework.
This is the case in my country, Poland.
We should listen to them.
There is still time for resistance.
This draft Constitution must be rejected.
I recommend the minorityâs amendment.
Europe deserves better.
The draft amendment rights this wrong.
This is, therefore, very pleasing to us.
The more generous Constitution is to be observed.
All countries will become richer in this respect.
That is a debate reserved for connoisseurs like us.
From disarmament, we are now moving towards rearmament.
This is not a document for the future.
It is a return to old-style imperialism and colonialism.
It is something I reject.
Â Â  I declare the session adjourned until 3 p.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  .
The amount allocated falls somewhat short of initial expectations.
I have received the following nominations:
â Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros
â Mr Giuseppe Fortunato
Two other nominations have been declared inadmissible.
(A secret ballot was held)
Members voting: 643
Blank or void ballot papers: 34
Votes cast: 609
Majority required: 305
The results were as follows:
Nikiforos DIAMANDOUROS 564 votes
Giuseppe FORTUNATO 45 votes
Â Â  .
Congratulations, MrÂ Diamandouros.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Recommendation: Nicholson (A6-0001/2005)
Â Â  .
This funding must be allocated in an even-handed manner.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Horizontal application clauses should also be highlighted.
Most people are in favour of it.
That is fantastic progress.
We must stop this commuting between Strasbourg and Brussels.
A new era is on the way.
What a missed opportunity, Mr Corbett!
A Constitution should not establish the content of policy.
That is why the June List rejects this draft.
This Treaty brings the EU closer to its citizens.
That is people power!
I would not dream of supporting this Constitution.
I will defend the Irish constitution against usurpation.
Where is the truth in all of this?
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
We should be ashamed of ourselves.
âNoâ to the Constitutional Treaty!
We will be there.
Every club, every society has one.
I see it as an opportunity.
The document is not perfect.
For us, that must remain the priority.
Secondly, this Constitution is a good thing.
That is most certainly what I will do.
What more important document could we give our citizens?
Firstly.
Secondly.
I am about to finish, Mr President.
Thank you.
I thank you.
It was, in reality, two things.
It is, however, an issue of communication.
Let me say why this is so.
Â Â  Mr President, this Constitutional Treaty is worth upholding.
In short, this Treaty is well worth upholding.
Why?
My father was incarcerated by the communist regime.
The sovereignty of Member States should not be threatened.
Can we pretend that this will not happen?
Our civilisation has developed from Christian roots.
I think not.
We had good grounds for this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It takes two sides to make a debate.
There are however also negative sides to the Constitution.
However, our work cannot stop here.
Without their support, the Constitution makes no sense.
Not a single ballot has yet been cast.
No means no.
I am going to vote in favour.
Â Â  .
They seem to be twofold.
Centralised, the European Union?
That is the only power the Union has.
Some superstate!
Advances have been made.
They are perhaps insufficient.
Nor should revisions be considered just at this time.
The Presidency concurs with this assertion.
Â Â  .
The word 'perfect' has been mentioned.
The words used this morning are worth recalling.
They have already received a reply from Mr Corbett.
Has the role of national parliaments been weakened?
I look forward to joining you in that debate.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
These elements will consolidate the work.
Integration is an absolutely vital part of the process.
Let us hear the experiences of these people.
I have a number of questions.
Â Â  .
In this period we will launch a public debate.
That is entirely false.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I look forward to more.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That would not be the correct approach.
Standing still is not an option.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Will the Commission address this issue?
Â Â  .
Â Â  I too wish to welcome Commissioner McCreevy.
Â Â  .
I shall now speak in English.
Her reply has satisfied me.
I thank you once again, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Combating poverty has been relegated to a secondary role.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Fourth is food: food security and rural development.
Â Â  .
Our wish is to address these issues through dialogue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
However, we will certainly consider that.
Â Â  .
This device exists somewhere in Milan or southern Italy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for that clear answer.
You have that power.
Â Â  .
What level of funding will be allocated for this?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
So we have a real problem.
Â Â  .
The Luxembourg Presidency follows that of our Dutch friends.
The EU made significant progress under the Dutch Presidency.
The decision-making system has naturally become more complicated.
I shall now turn to transatlantic relations.
That opportunity must now be seized.
The fight against terrorism must be a permanent priority.
Let us not be under any illusions.
Of course competitiveness must be stepped up.
We have far too many processes in Europe.
We must change this by streamlining our strategy.
We should like this strategy to remain essentially European.
The strategy must be there for the long haul.
Economic and Monetary Union needs stability.
We promised a stable currency.
It will remain stable and it will remain strong.
From this perspective, Luxembourg is always the loser.
I am wary of extreme solutions.
I am not under any illusions, however.
Let us decide.
Let us decide quickly.
Let us decide now.
Presidencies come and go, but fortunately Europe remains.
That is what Parliament wants to see.
Europe's prosperity is under threat.
Too many priorities means no priority at all.
Growth and jobs must be our priorities.
The first is the knowledge economy.
Returning to growth will require considerable investment in knowledge.
Only well-trained people can ensure high productivity.
We cannot have more Europe with fewer financial resources.
The first of these is cohesion.
Enlargement has had a far-reaching impact on solidarity.
We must not now jeopardise that great success.
You also made reference to the Stability Pact.
That is what is known as social cohesion.
There is no conflict, but complementarity.
There cannot be more Europe with less money.
Â Â  .
Mr President, this is the eleventh Luxembourg presidency.
It is in serious danger of stalling.
Structural labour market reform is essential to Lisbon.
We also share your ambitions for enlargement.
New arrivals are on the horizon.
Bulgaria and Romania will shortly be joining us.
Croatia cannot duck that issue.
That is a task for your presidency.
That is the difference, Mr Poettering!
You said something very interesting.
That is something we do not want.
My first question to you is a short one.
Had this slipped your mind?
Â Â  .
Is that still your opinion?
Is that so, MrÂ Juncker?
The rebate took to negotiate.
Is that the case?
More details will follow shortly and regularly.
I have four questions.
The other issue concerns the energy area.
Obviously, that is not the case.
Finally, the fourth area.
How do you intend to work with REACH?
I therefore wish to ask four questions.
The second issue will be the Financial Perspective.
The implementation of the Pact benefits from clear decision-making.
Clear sanctions are still needed.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
I wish the Luxembourg presidency every success.
It will be in the interests of us all.
That all means more affluence and more cohesion.
Let me be frank with you, Mr Juncker.
It depends on us.
Is existing legislation being properly enforced and implemented?
It is clearly not.
Children cannot defend themselves.
Thus it is our obligation to do this.
Children are vulnerable to trafficking.
What should therefore be done?
I wish it every success.
I shall explain what I mean by this.
The Luxembourg Presidency has made its priorities quite clear.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We should be proud of the European response.
We have also been quick in mobilising civil protection.
So why is the Commission proposing this?
The main reason is speed.
We need to move with reconstruction funds now.
The answer is no.
The answer is no.
I count on your support in this regard.
It is impressive!
We will pursue our efforts relentlessly.
Solidarity is a trademark of the European Union.
Let it be experienced also in times of crisis.
The idea is very appealing.
Â Â  .
The amount continues to rise.
This must be reviewed.
We must deliver the aid which we have promised.
Our aid must be visible.
Our taxpayers demand visibility.
Ownership matters.
I am glad that President Barroso mentioned that.
After all, the Americans evacuated Diego Garcia.
However, that telephone call did not come.
This does not only apply to Asia.
Will the Commission prepare an urgent report?
Â Â  .
Thus far, its response has been promising.
Would that be possible?
Thank you.
I apologise, MrÂ President.
Let the misfortune of south-east Asia be a lesson.
What did the European Monitoring Centre achieve?
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Constitution is a step forward.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We therefore support the proposed Constitutional Treaty.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  We have voted against this report.
These are things to which I object.
I wish to see European cooperation at intergovernmental level.
Â Â  .
I voted against this report in the final vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Today, the advocates of the Constitution are celebrating.
New social basic rights are lacking.
I do not want this Constitution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I had hoped for better.
I voted against the resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It deserves all our support.
Â Â  .
I ask you to undertake an immediate investigation.
You will receive a complaint in writing.
That completes the explanations of votes.
Â Â  I declare the session resumed.
Â Â  You made your point.
Your question will be answered in due time.
It is not a point of order.
Thank you.
It is not a point of order.
You will get your explanation in due time.
We can assume that the Minutes are approved.
It is spread all over the place!
Perhaps he could clean up the litter.
Â Â  The matter is closed.
Let us proceed with the sitting.
I cannot find anything about this in the Rules.
We have done that.
You have now spoken for the second time.
I consider the whole issue closed.
There will be no more points of order.
We need to learn how to help.
There is a problem here.
That is what the EU must concentrate on.
This is a great opportunity.
The role of the UN is crucial here.
A number of things have been mentioned.
The earth moved and the public were moved.
Now we demand real, lasting and effective action.
The people of our world have never felt closer.
Let us learn our lesson one day.
What task remains?
What can we do to dispel these concerns?
All this makes these regions less attractive to tourists.
Any reconstruction must be broader based and more sustainable.
The disaster can also be seen as an opportunity.
This is where international cooperation is of huge importance.
I do not share the view of some colleagues.
I would like to make two suggestions.
There are three points I should like to discuss.
The third point concerns food aid.
It was caused by nature and global unpreparedness.
Some of these have not yet come into being.
I do also have a request.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
I thank you.
We are Europeans, after all.
There is a lack of coordination in this area.
Finally, the reconstruction.
This is about human dignity.
This is quite definitely an important and core issue.
We need to invest more in this area.
Â Â  .
What are the concrete measures to be taken?
It is important that we bear that in mind.
We are looking at a wide range of actions.
I also believe that prevention is crucial.
The best help is to save lives.
The debate is closed.
We have to work on it.
Â Â  .
This debate today is both timely and welcome.
First, EU-US relations are truly unique and irreplaceable.
This is a significant move.
Much work remains to be done.
The Commission shares that feeling.
Â Â  .
The guiding principle of European external policy is multilateralism.
Together, we can achieve a lot.
Â Â  .
Today we adopted the Constitution.
This applies to both the multilateral and bilateral agendas.
You have together unleashed three wars against the peoples.
This is the first and major merit.
The people of Europe will ...
We also share a number of common enemies.
We could take a leaf out of their book.
Just think of the tsunami in South-East Asia.
The contrast was harrowing and spoke volumes.
This is not the right approach to take.
Â Â  Many thanks, MrÂ President.
What requirements must be met to achieve democracy?
I thank you.
The modern world does not need US domination.
Quite the reverse is the case.
Â Â  .
I would ask you to bear this in mind.
The debate is closed.
Little impact has been had on trading debt.
Â Â  .
Some examples will illustrate my point.
It ranks 92nd in the Human Development Index.
There is a difference between cancelling and relieving debt.
Â Â  .
We would be helping them to help themselves.
Other financial instruments will also be used.
Therefore new opportunities and focused measures must be sought.
That is an appropriate, necessary and urgent commitment.
The resolution is extremely vague.
What will happen if we cancel those loans?
How much will this cost?
Perhaps the Commission could elaborate on this.
Developing countries are not all alike.
There are very different situations.
Within which frameworks are we to act?
Â Â  .
I should like to respond as follows.
The real issue is appropriate levels of development financing.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Has the Council dealt with this issue?
What is its view of the European coastguard service?
Â Â  I note the suggestion made by the honourable Member.
Does he personally think it is a good idea?
I think that it is a good idea.
This is far from being the case.
Please excuse my poor pronunciation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The Council has not yet touched on this issue.
I think a pragmatic approach is necessary.
We can see that on our television screens.
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The sitting is closed.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, good morning.
We can therefore proceed with the agenda as normal.
Â Â  .
Let me turn now to three questions.
That is a positive sign.
We very much welcome this development.
The European Neighbourhood Policy is distinct from membership.
I thank you.
I can inform you of their proposals.
Nor must the massive trauma of Chernobyl be forgotten.
We must find answers to these questions.
I thank you.
Yet are we in a position to guarantee this?
I thank you.
I thank you.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
It can be said that the Ukrainians were victorious.
Courage and caution are needed.
The revolution in Ukraine has come to an end.
We should take our place amongst the adventurers.
I thank you.
We cannot give our consent to this.
Ukraine will never be the same again.
Ukraine needs to set itself two objectives.
Our tasks are as follows.
What is Europe to do now?
This is also a victory for Europe.
We must not, indeed cannot, disappoint them.
I always supported Ukraine's EU-membership aspirations.
This road map should include the following.
Â Â  .
I have also carefully considered the criticisms.
What are the main characteristics of an action plan?
Â Â  The debate on Ukraine is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
From that a number of things stand out.
They were not consulted at all about those plans.
Over 60% of them are aged over 55.
The service said that it was not possible.
An important question arises from that.
The Commission has behaved in a disgraceful manner.
However, it is never too late.
Â Â  .
The employer did nothing to discharge its obligations.
I doubt it.
Something urgently needs to be done about this.
That is an important point of departure.
We have heard the Commissionâs reply.
In fact, that is not the case.
Rather, this is a genuine labour dispute.
That is not acceptable.
That is not possible.
I thank you.
My fellow MEPs have talked at length about this.
That way, you will fare much better.
Let us not forget that other problems persist.
The trialogue was ignored.
The discrimination happened right here in Parliament.
The second reason is legal.
This coexistence has always constituted a legal risk.
The difference in salary and other conditions was significant.
Secondly, there was the question about procurement restrictions.
This was not a restrictive procedure.
A remark was made about the exaggerated figure.
The decision was taken on that basis.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Of course I disagree with these practices.
There can be no doubt.
This will happen, have no doubt.
(1)
Â Â  Thank you very much.
This will be done.
(2)
(3)
(4)
Â Â  .
The national right of initiative would thus be protected.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I broadly support this Resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I have voted in favour of this resolution.
The mobilisation of the European peoples has been exemplary.
- Combat paedophilia.
Â Â  .
The disaster mainly hit the grass-roots classes.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The focus now is on building the future.
Â Â  .
Working together, we can achieve more.
Â Â  I totally support this Joint Motion.
Â Â  .
Maintaining the debt is unacceptable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The economic growth of developing countries must be people-focused.
Our amendments seeking written-off debts were voted down.
It is an anti-imperialist fight.
They are fighting for international relations to change radically.
They are fighting to defeat the imperialist system.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  â Voting time is over.
Â Â  The sitting is resumed.
Our demands are still on the agenda.
It follows that the arms embargo must be maintained.
We return today to his case.
I am pleased to hear Mr Mann's comments.
I hope this House can support this resolution.
Only then can we expect results.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Six pregnant women have been executed this year alone.
But we have to offer them encouragement.
This is, frankly, a very soft resolution.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We must continue to address those who are responsible.
We must act with resolution.
Asian women are well aware of their dignity.
They wish to support their fundamental cultural values.
The pimps were arrested in the same operation.
That is according to a Cambodian Government report.
Those figures have increased dramatically since the 1990s.
Traffickers quite often receive assistance from immigration officials.
We also need education and training for border police.
Such treatment is plainly an insult to human dignity.
I thank you.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
But it did happen.
It is unimaginable, but it was real.
It is an evil that affects all of us.
The compromise contains two points.
The rest of the wording remains unchanged.
Paragraph 15 is inappropriate in this context.
Â Â  This amendment would affect the text as follows.
I ask you to support this amendment.
Â Â  Mr Sonik, there has been some confusion.
Â Â  That is the case.
I apologise for the mistake.
There are two separate amendments here.
Two separate votes are required here.
This was the first point I wished to make.
This is a point we must emphasise.
However, you did not allow me to speak.
We are voting on amendments.
Let us therefore continue with the procedure.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the recommendation.
Â Â  .
I naturally voted in favour.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the recommendation.
Â Â  .
This is a necessary consequence of the recent enlargement.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Such obfuscation is unacceptable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Dare one talk in terms of a thaw?
Â Â  Mr President, I shall be brief.
I consider this to be a scandal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  This resolution deals with extremely important issues.
Â Â  .
That is contempt for history.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
After that, all that remains is silence.
Â Â  .
I vehemently condemn such acts.
We owe them truth.
That past must not disappear from sight, ever.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Six million Poles died in that war.
We must learn from the truth about Auschwitz.
Every individualâs life is sacred.
How did this come about?
People are still being killed every day.
The authorities are quite indifferent to this.
The Dutch authorities have failed to react.
The Commissionâs crocodile tears really are ridiculous.
The disabled remain forgotten.
Please forgive me.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Poettering.
Â Â  The next item is the order of business.
Â Â  I understand then that the request has been withdrawn.
No amendment to the Thursday sitting has been proposed.
Does that also apply to Question Time?
Â Â  The Community cereals market is in a critical state.
Three problems have arisen in the Community cereals market.
It was a lesson in democracy.
The day passed without incident.
This is dramatic.
That is what was heard.
There was a very poor turnout ...
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks.
Such disasters are not specific to South-East Asia.
Twenty Member States of the EU have coastlines.
How can that be?
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
If we want passion, we need controversy.
And the future does not look promising.
Nothing equates to the Nazi holocaust.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Â Â  For a personal statement, Mr President.
Â Â  Which Rule of Procedure are you invoking?
Â Â  Rule 27 B.
Â Â  Did you say Rule 27 B?
What does that have to do with personal statements?
Â Â  Which Rule are you invoking?
I imagine you are referring to Rule 145.
Is that the case, Mr Tejedor?
Â Â  It is Rule 145, Mr Borrell Fontell.
Â Â  You have thirty seconds.
Goodness gracious me!
Mr Barroso has the floor.
First, actions count more than words.
The Commission is fully committed to this task.
We all know that striking a balance is difficult.
This requires listening carefully to your opinions and contributions.
Take the REACH initiative, for example.
When liberalising markets, individuals must not be forgotten.
Without solidarity, we can never be united.
Naturally, we must also look beyond our borders.
The situation is clearly disappointing.
Environmental considerations are not constraints or obstacles.
We shall have to act quickly and effectively.
We are ambitious, and so are you.
You have that energy.
I want to make that very clear.
Let me emphasise that.
That is in the past now.
We must make a decision.
No!
Then we shall gladly give you our backing.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Our aim is complete consensus.
That will establish our credibility on the Iran issue.
I must re-emphasise that point.
Â Â  .
At the same time, unemployment is rising.
These actions are weakening demand instead of strengthening it.
We regard this as a pernicious trend.
Â Â  .
Here we go again!
Â Â  .
The European Union must implement the new Services Directive.
We also need effective public services.
I am not criticising you, MrÂ President.
Europe must defend its social and environmental models.
That will not work.
It is perhaps appropriate to reiterate that in passing.
This is vitally important.
For me it is simple.
Jobs are created in companies.
Define the target group.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
This is very pleasing.
Former Commissioner Kinnock was responsible for this.
In this regard I anticipate very clear answers.
And one more thing!
Thank you very much!
Thank you.
I should like to thank him for that.
I thank you.
The second issue relates to security and justice.
This is an implementation programme for this year.
That is a sensitive subject.
This is no neoliberal proposal on our part.
The Commission includes Christian Democrats, Socialists and Liberals.
Do not present a caricature of our Commission.
That is not fair.
What do you believe Europeans expect now?
I believe that this is genuinely possible.
There was therefore no failure to honour obligations.
We need a strong Commission.
We are the European institutions .
As citizens, we have rights, however.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
We must offer an internal and an external response.
Last week, the Kyoto Protocol entered into force.
That is why I welcome our debate today.
They took the initiative to propose some important ideas.
We can turn globalisation into an advantage.
It is the largest integrated market.
We must demonstrate solidarity.
I shall conclude now.
The European Union is a world player.
We must accept that responsibility.
Europe has a very specific contribution to make.
Â Â  .
A global tax is today being discussed.
Take the initiative, Mr President of the Commission.
The EU should lead the way here.
It is clearly not these things.
The message could not be clearer.
I thank you for your attention.
Was any listening done in Davos, however?
The EU is needed, and it bears responsibility.
This approach flies in the face of reality.
But even India has its downside.
What is to be done?
I see no good in such measures.
They put the cart before the horse.
Not at all.
Politicians have let people down in the past.
That is our position.
This is also a shared responsibility.
The debate is closed.
We need strong measures.
Mutual trust must be stepped up.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
This is more than just procedure, however.
We need action, not just intentions, Commissioner.
What matters is surely what happens in reality.
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks, MrÂ President.
Many thanks, MrÂ President.
Commissioner Frattini mentioned the Fourniret case a moment ago.
I thank you.
How can Europe provide support?
By evaluating special procedures and best practices.
And where does the problem lie?
Â Â  Thank you.
Thank you.
That is where this issue will be tested.
That is a job that we will do wholeheartedly.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Industry had to recognise the purpose of this reform.
We can cooperate even when we are being competitive.
That is an example of international cooperation.
Â Â  .
There is no doubt about that.
That was also Mr Monti's approach.
Those are some of the proposals that were accepted.
Â Â  .
This is not really the same as competition.
This would be a much richer source of efficiency.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
I thank you.
I hope that you will enjoy both.
Â Â  .
They mark the start of our dialogue.
There is no doubt about that.
Mrs Elisa Ferreira asked about gas and electricity liberalisation.
It is important to differentiate between preferences for liberalisation.
Mrs Ferreira said that the title was misleading.
Another question was about audiovisuals.
Today's debate is just the start.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I should like to outline a few key points.
Another important point for me is evidence-based policy making.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you Mr President.
We cannot do that.
I say: then let us change the laws.
Â Â  .
So far, so good.
This, though, is probably not enough.
This is absolutely impracticable.
What if there is no private equivalent?
Unfortunately, Mr Barroso is no Manet or Renoir.
Â Â  .
That is why timing is so essential.
I thank Mrs in 't Veld again.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Â I declare the sitting open.
Yesterday I spoke here in plenary.
It made me look stupid.
I want this noted for the record.
I would, however, advise against urgent procedure.
These matters must firstly be investigated.
They are opposed to the export of old vessels.
Relative poverty has fallen sharply, though.
I am not about to lapse into blissful euro-optimism.
The Union could do better.
Why invest if demand is so moribund?
Why is that the case?
I have three preliminary observations here.
People draw differing conclusions from all this.
We need to embark on structural reforms.
A majority of the committee supported this viewpoint.
Â Â  .
We cannot rely on macroeconomic policy to achieve it.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
That is a sensible strategy and one we support.
There are still barriers to trade in some areas.
The public needs to see clear progress on this.
I now come to my fourth and final point.
Quite the opposite!
The unemployment rate has hit a new record high.
Â Â  , .
So why is growth so poor?
Several speakers have blamed the Stability and Growth Pact.
They cannot both be right.
I suggest that both sides are missing the point.
Let me analyse this.
So why is this not happening?
Go and talk to small businessmen.
The whole ethos is biased against the employer.
The whole model is in drastic need of revision.
Â Â  .
That undermines the credibility of the overall EMU framework.
It has to be taken into account.
The appropriate sanctions are not being applied here.
Rules are there to be respected.
We need to take the Lisbon strategy seriously.
Â Â  Thank you Mr President.
Thank you.
We have to be practical and realistic.
The Pact therefore has to be reformed.
A few years later the Iron Curtain fell.
Where is your contribution to a meaningful debate?
Structural reforms, I hear you say!
Quite right!
Europe and its Member States need structural reforms.
You want everyone to work longer hours.
Europe stands to gain more from that.
Otherwise we cannot support this nonsense.
The Lisbon Strategy is a platonic ambition.
Who could not support the objectives set in Lisbon?
Who would not be in favour of these objectives?
We will not win the game this way.
Controls on public spending are a despised constraint.
What do we blame the ECB for?
We blame it for being stupid and malicious.
Better late than never, though.
I am not making empty threats.
I thank you.
We show much greater pragmatism.
They do so in this House, however.
The result would be political antagonism.
In short, it is a scandal.
I am strongly in favour of the Pact.
Three issues should be kept in mind.
Many thanks.
Thus, the expensive euro has exacerbated the recession.
They have done their homework.
Does that not represent a watering down?
We want to see the correct reforms.
What is the European dimension?
Just listen, please!
You know I am right.
Six percentage points!
That difference no longer exists.
Â Â  .
What are we doing?
Governance is very important.
It is very important that we reach an agreement.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Try to help us do honour to this idea.
Â Â  .
Currently, 70% of us live in cities.
The city is our closest cultural environment.
Noise and pollution levels therefore rise to inhumane proportions.
Noise and pollution have become significant cultural factors.
We are evolving into a digital network-aided cultural society.
A global digital networked environment.
Â Â  .
The spirit of cooperation should be rather broader.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I appreciate their help.
We should endeavour to strike that balance here.
Tobacco smoke kills both smokers and non-smokers.
Â Â  .
As far as biomonitoring is concerned, we agree.
We shall study this view in detail.
We likewise agree on air inside buildings.
Some projects will certainly be completed by 2010.
So things need to be weighed up carefully.
The action programme itself is disappointing.
A second subject of discussion was smoking.
The environment and health report is topical.
In the Netherlands, the figure is 13Â 000.
What is to be done?
That is vital.
Fear is nothing more than uncertainty arising from ignorance.
Â Â  Your request is accepted.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
Provide is to run or monitor.
Â Â  .
I apologise for that.
This concerns three amendments and five paragraphs.
It may also be laid down in several acts.
This is the same principle as in Amendment 19.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that will be complicated.
That is what I am saying.
I think that would be clearer.
Â Â  Mr President, I hope I can help you.
If that is acceptable then we can go ahead.
I will indicate when the oral amendment applies.
It relates to the need for structural reforms.
I shall read the amendment in English.
He claims that his amendment was accepted.
I can only ask the services to check this.
Â Â  .
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The June List is therefore voting against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
A single European legal system is therefore not desirable.
Subsequently, this report can come up for debate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  .
I congratulate the rapporteur.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Overloaded bureaucracy?
That is purely a national problem.
It is perfect.
Neither Brussels nor Frankfurt could get it wrong.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
It is therefore inevitable that disputes will arise.
Â Â  .
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  .
It has become a constant battle.
It has therefore become a burden.
Firstly, it does not recognise typologies.
A separate Natura will have to be created.
Â Â  .
It provides jobs and revitalises rural areas.
Â Â  .
But we are not deluding ourselves, Commissioner.
We really need to go further.
On the ground, we only wanted â¦
Â Â  .
Sadly, it seems not.
That is patently stupid.
Wiser counsels know this is impossible.
Has anybody asked the bats?
No, of course not.
You could even call it batty!
But there is a need for guarantees.
This would then safeguard the substance of Natura 2000.
We need a special fund.
We have heard much about that this afternoon.
The Commission has never liked the LIFE Programme.
Â Â  .
All the new Member States have submitted their lists.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Â Â  .
All the new Member States have submitted their lists.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Such action must also be adequately resourced.
I thank you.
Â Â  .
Children are very sensitive to environmental influences.
It is not only our environment that causes illness.
Lifestyle-related illness also constitutes a great threat today.
This is common sense.
This is also common sense.
It eventually aims to help improve human health.
Is this common sense?
An obvious example is smoking.
Is this what we are doing?
Not quite!
This is definitely not common sense.
Allow me to mention three points.
Â Â  Thank you, Madam President.
Less development means less health.
Forgive me for being sceptical.
All impact assessments must be attributable to their authors.
We have to be frank about this.
Â Â  .
The contribution of the European Parliament is very important.
The Commission fully agrees with this line.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Â Â  .
This situation is no longer acceptable.
This will help to increase protection against fraud.
The public also gain added value from legal certainty.
This does nothing to enhance road safety either.
That is not to be tolerated.
The same must apply to those in poor health.
There is no sign of driving licences being exchanged.
We tried it in Denmark, and it worked.
The world did not come to an end.
Accordingly, we have to be very careful.
The idea is a good one.
My final point has already been mentioned.
This situation cannot go on indefinitely here in Europe.
I ask you!
These requirements should guarantee the holdersâ capability.
I must therefore adjourn the debate at this point.
It will be resumed this evening at 9.00 p.m.
Â Â  .
Member States may not add criteria to this list.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  .
I thank the honourable Member for her addition.
Â Â  .
A number of complaints have been received.
No such complaints have been lodged with the Commission.
I thank you.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Is the Commission aware of this?
Â Â  .
My question is therefore very specific, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
I would like to answer MrÂ Posselt as follows.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is my answer to Mr Purvis
Â Â  .
Â Â  Mrs Schierhuber, we have a deadline.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â Allow me to insist, Commissioner.
I am here, opposite you.
You mention safety certificates in particular.
We shall see how to respond to this suggestion.
Now I will answer Mrs Vincenziâs question.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner.
Â Â  Questions 53 and 54 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  .
Our own evaluation studies also confirmed these observations.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is why things are going to be changed.
Since then, however, nothing has changed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I have listened to your proposal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Thank you for your advice in this important area.
Â Â  .
Thank you for the question.
Therefore, we must reform the sugar industry.
I should like the Commission's view on that.
Â Â  .
However, I would like to give you ...
Â Â  Commissioner, let me interrupt you.
This supplementary question is not on the same topic.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much for your detailed answer.
Â Â  .
The driving licence directive is very complex and intricate.
We cannot leave this to subsidiarity.
And that is going too far.
Thank you.
We have our own tradition; others have theirs.
Allow me to raise another point of criticism.
That is not the case.
A plastic credit card-type driving licence would be ideal.
The current paper licences lend themselves to fraud.
I thank you.
Congratulations, Mr Grosch!
It is true that we must be very careful.
I therefore believe we must be extremely careful.
That is what I wanted to say.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
I should like to enlarge on the key points.
Secondly, illegal discharges are to be traced.
What will the Commission do to improve it?
I would simply like to add a few words.
Seamen already have a hard and dangerous life.
The figures speak for themselves.
This is three thousand too many!
Â Â  .
However, this report says more.
Where do they dump the other 93%?
Most of it in the sea, probably.
Thank you.
Let us continue to use them.
Why?
How will you, Commissioner, enforce it?
We need to stand firm against unaccountability and irresponsibility.
That was the point I wished to make.
He has no right to misquote me.
Â Â  . I apologise.
The debate is closed.
The directive serves a dual purpose.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Our committee was concerned about two aspects.
SMEs and consulting are very important.
Can you deliver on this, Commissioner?
Secondly, ports will be upgraded to intermodal interfaces.
What remains to be done?
The real challenge lies in the interfaces.
There is a great deal to be done here.
Much remains to be done in this respect.
That was the point I wanted to make.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The starting point of this legislation is safety.
Therefore the industry will always need workers.
In this case, English is the language involved.
The prevention of fraud is a very important issue.
Â Â  .
The proposed amendments further the Commissionâs goals.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The Commission can accept Amendment 1.
The Commission has difficulty in accepting Amendment 2.
The Commission can accept Amendment 3.
The Commission has difficulty in accepting Amendment 5.
The Commission can accept Amendment 6.
The Commission can accept Amendment 17.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment 21.
The Commission has difficulty with Amendments 23 and 24.
The Commission has difficulty with Amendment 32.
They have the effect of weakening the proposal.
Â Â  .
Two concern the role of regional advisory councils.
The remaining amendments centre on joint deployment plans.
The competence of the agency must remain clearly visible.
Â Â  .
The environmental crisis in the North Sea is man-made.
This is known as a beneficial crisis.
Surprise, surprise!
Perhaps we should get ready to light the beacons!
Northern Ireland's experiences of it have been dire.
The Commission's proposals seek to achieve that objective.
I hope the Commission will reconsider that.
It was a good idea.
I trust that the Council can improve the situation.
That would help ensure compliance.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I applaud Commissioner Borg for this initiative.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I will group the interventions into four points.
Nevertheless technical measures have a part to play.
Â Â  Many thanks, Commissioner.
That brings us to the end of the agenda.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I visited the region the day before Sharm el-Sheikh.
Let me say a brief word now on Lebanon.
I regret that I will be unable to attend.
I shall outline those proposals very briefly.
We should promote the study of European integration.
Let us honour him by doing good work there.
This includes achieving peace between Israel and Palestine.
We urge Syria to make its contribution to peace.
We have several ways forward.
We will shortly be welcoming Mr Yushchenko.
I believe that is what we must â¦
The first of those areas is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Those statements are unambiguous.
I thank you.
I believe that the Arabs deserve democracy.
President Bush rightly talks about Arab freedom.
Unilateralism has no part to play in it.
There are more than enough of those around already.
A Euro-Mediterranean Summit will be held in November.
I refer to South-South free trade amongst themselves.
Too many of their borders are still closed.
I believe these two issues are of vital importance.
Let me conclude with the Middle East conflict.
This year, 2005, could be our opportunity.
That is why assistance must be provided very swiftly.
Prompt action is therefore required.
My answer is yes.
Yes.
My answer is clear, it is yes.
Should they withdraw their troops from Lebanon?
Yes, and they have started to do so.
That is my question to the Council.
The question is crucial.
Other civil society organisations are being formed.
The present circumstances are favourable but very fragile.
Europe needs to be more committed.
I wish to comment on two or three points.
My third comment concerns Iraq.
Wars do not resolve problems, they exacerbate them.
Some countries joined the coalition, some did not.
The price we all paid was enormous.
Let us support democracy using our European soft means.
Let us disarm it in our soft way.
How should we do this?
Not via non-transparent budgetary support.
Let us stick with Resolution 1559.
Most of them are facing great challenges, however.
I am glad CommissionerÂ Ferrero-Waldner emphasised education.
We have a shared future.
What are those signals?
The theory is simpler than the practice.
The prospects have rarely been so good.
However, the impact is positive.
Mr Solana's comments are unacceptable in this form.
Our attitude towards Syria is not one of weakness.
It is a green paper on legal immigration.
The other side must make an effort too.
I gave both leaders this clear message.
The Israelis have to do everything possible as well.
The Israelis must also go back to the table.
The next quartet meeting will be held in London.
The Gaza disengagement will be very difficult.
It will now be a coordinated disengagement.
Sharon has already said this.
This has been one of the long-standing challenges.
Now it is a promise.
I particularly wanted to mention that.
I have already announced this.
On the contrary, we take it very seriously.
We hope we can make progress.
All this must be done in parallel.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
Some decisions have already been taken.
These are three essential subjects.
The key issue here is thematic engagement.
Terrorism is often only addressed from the other side.
We reserve the right to a final vote.
Our presence in Geneva must not be purely symbolic.
The approach needs to be discarded.
I am addressing the more conservative Members in particular.
This does not lend any credibility to our work.
But why should they be mutually exclusive?
The report also includes documents guaranteeing citizens their rights.
Basic human rights include political rights.
These are serious considerations.
This leads me to make two comments.
My second comment concerns effectiveness.
Conditions in Zimbabwe are appalling.
The right to development is being denied to many.
That is respect for human rights.
Their only crime is belonging to a religious community.
It could close mouths when they should be open.
Â Â  The debate is suspended.
The debate will resume at 3 p.m.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  The relevant departments will certainly note your comments.
We will of course deal with this matter.
Before the vote:
MrÂ Yushchenko was therefore unable to reach Strasbourg.
This was the European Parliamentâs standpoint.
There are therefore two reasons for us to rejoice.
Â Â  (1).
We have chosen the European civilisation.
Thank you, all of you.
Dear friends, we are here together.
We are now united by shared values.
We have a shared history.
We have shared aspirations.
There was a lot of corruption.
We appreciate your commitment to grasping this historic opportunity.
Nobody can do that work for us.
This is clearly one of our priorities.
Dear friends, nothing is guaranteed.
Unless a house has solid foundations it will collapse.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Yushchenko.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
It is similar to other previous recommendations.
I have supported these association and cooperation agreements.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
One of those instruments is lifelong learning.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Member States are now facing up to their responsibilities.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Sweden proved years ago that switching is possible.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
All things considered, I voted for the proposal.
Real-time information thus clearly makes the sector more competitive.
Â Â  .
Measures such as those proposed therefore have my support.
Â Â  Mr President, I will be very brief.
Our explanation of vote is very simple.
That is why we voted for those amendments.
Â Â  . Brussels loves agencies.
Yet who will those observers be?
Â Â  .
I therefore submit that fishermen must be included.
Â Â  .
We should not prejudice the debate at this stage.
Primary responsibility in this area lies with Member States.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted against the report.
The first is that of Colombia.
Firstly, there is Iran.
On the contrary, they occupy an important place.
China was also mentioned.
These are real sanctions.
Belarus has also been mentioned.
Â Â  .
This is the case with China.
I wish to continue in English.
There are some very interesting ideas.
He has our full support.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Moldova really has to promote respect for human rights.
I said all of that to them personally.
This was mentioned again yesterday.
This conflict has still not been finally resolved.
It has now become Europeâs poorest country.
There is now room for this.
Its railway system is broken in two.
For them there truly can be none.
The Moldova resolution is well balanced.
I am referring here to Teleradio Moldova airtime.
Ukraine has set a precedent.
Â Â  âThank you Mr President.
Thank you.
You want to subjugate Moldova.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has spoken about the European neighbourhood policy.
Â Â  .
We talked about it at length yesterday.
At the time there was a .
This was said yesterday.
Moldova is the poorest country in Europe today.
But let us not to go too far.
Let us act.
Many things need to be done.
The action plan is appropriate to that.
Please look at the action plan.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
Outlawed.
I hope that it is possible to reverse this.
We are not and must not feel alone.
This initiative has not been without effect.
Yet sometimes merely giving money has no effect.
This is one way to reduce hunger and poverty.
I thank you.
Now is the time to act.
Â Â  .
This is a truly fundamental question.
Â Â  .
The situation today is completely the opposite.
It also relates to the quality of the institutions.
I thank you.
That is 24Â 000 too many.
For that reason, I wholeheartedly back this resolution.
MrÂ Zapatero has kept his promise.
There are three reasons for this.
Secondly, the objective is attainable.
The very law of nature bears testimony to this.
May solidarity prevail over the unrestrained desire for profit.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen.
Europe can do more and it can do better.
Malnutrition means disease and disability.
Disease means a reduced and ever less-productive workforce.
The key is not food aid but food security.
If you cannot buy local, buy regional.
That is what this motion sets out to achieve.
That will be a real test of our mettle.
It is time now for action.
They will watch what we do and judge us.
This is inconsistent and not particularly credible.
Let us fight together for a fairer world.
A moment of indignation therefore does have its place.
You are right in one respect.
The debate is closed.
With its aid policy the EU must contribute to:
â radically reducing hunger and severe poverty,
â making elementary education general in developing countries,
â increasing equality of opportunity for women,
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
A new situation has therefore arisen.
The textile and clothing industry is constantly restructuring.
I think this is a very important issue.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I can be brief.
I will then answer questions on this issue.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Time is of the essence.
It is worth putting this into an historical perspective.
This process continued during the 1960s and 1970s.
We have had ten years to adapt.
We hope that there will now be other guidelines.
Imports of pullovers increased by 613%.
The EU respects its commitments within the WTO.
This could encourage businesses to relocate to other latitudes.
There are two possible objectives.
This would forestall the threat of business relocation.
In Greece, entire towns have literally died.
Applications for import licences from China have risen.
The textile and clothing industry manufacturing base is shrinking.
At the same time, unemployment is constantly rising.
I have a few concrete questions and suggestions.
The Commission only needs the will to do this.
That is all true.
I believe that it is essential to do so.
Â Â  .
We are working on a very comprehensive strategy.
This is an important and clearly proactive strategy.
This is still under preparation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The Croatian Government has offered its unequivocal support.
Â Â  . I do not have much to add.
We are indeed in contact with the Croatian Government.
He sent out a rather different signal.
The restrictions are time-limited and are subject to review.
Â Â  . Yes, I will.
We will then have proposals for such a system.
Â Â  The honourable Member is perfectly right.
Â Â  .
Is it not time that we addressed this situation?
Surely a genuine free market has no loopholes.
This is a debate that has been initiated.
What is your view of this contradiction?
This is a most fundamental issue.
Â Â  .
Similarly, their application in practice is feasible.
Â Â  .
That is to be welcomed.
That is a good step forward.
The consumer knows where she or he stands.
We have helped our citizens, Mr President.
We have provided an object lesson for our colleagues.
I thank you all.
The average consumer will only skim through it.
This is a good thing.
In this respect it would be a splendid triumph.
Good news, then, and complete success.
We have chosen the right path.
This law must protect the vulnerable consumer.
It must ban unfair practices.
Â Â  .
However, it is a realistic and workable compromise.
This gives Member States room for manoeuvre.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Thank you for your support and attention.
I greatly welcome this report.
Thousands of lives have been saved.
I therefore ask for your support.
Otherwise, the work we are doing is worthless.
Â Â  .
We have achieved several very good compromises.
My group will support the report.
I thank everybody for their support on that.
This affects one million health workers across the EU.
It is women who are at a particular disadvantage.
Â Â  .
Mr President,
The health and safety of workers is paramount.
Â Â  .
I know: I have teenagers.
I had to make my son quit the job.
Those are the homeworkers, both men and women.
They work very hard and save society a fortune.
Their health and safety situation is critical.
The economic cost is equally vast.
Is it due to mere inadequacy and naivety?
It is very good that this should be so.
I can agree with all of that.
I cannot support either attempt.
It was a good try, though.
Â Â  () Good evening everyone!
Â Â  .
This means 5 000 more human tragedies.
I thank you.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Nothing points to this being the case at present.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.
The decisions it has just made contradict all that.
We seem to have seen it all before.
Are we perhaps maligning the company?
The sooner we do that, the better.
These are genuine reference models for the whole world.
Is this all no more than a dead letter?
It is time for action, not words.
Let me remind you of some.
It launches the idea of transnational collective bargaining.
What do I mean by 'more'?
Let me say two things in closing.
Europe can and must provide a different response.
Is this social dialogue?
Is this the Europe we want?
We have an obligation to do that.
Why was such an agreement possible at that time?
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
I welcome Commissioner PotoÄnik here today.
Research and development are key elements in that process.
Can this fine ambition be achieved?
How it is going to be achieved?
Now for the third suggestion.
We all pay at least lip service to this.
Â Â  .
Let me explain.
Knowledge does not only mean more competitive businesses.
The answer is yes.
I am very grateful for these questions.
Enlargement is one particular issue.
Let me make an important addition here.
Both factors are needed.
The current execution rates are close to 100%.
Simplification and rationalisation of procedures are greatly needed.
That is the only way we can succeed.
The time for delivery is now.
Their effort is necessary.
We can bring it to life by working together.
That is why I ask for your support.
We are therefore in agreement with Commissioner PotoÄnik.
The problem is the Member States.
We therefore have a lot of housework to do.
These people are very good at their jobs.
That is the percentage that we should double.
I therefore ask:
I would like to add something else.
Two questions come to mind in this connection.
I thank you.
Â Â  .
It is very encouraging for my future work.
That is a credible way of looking at it.
Public funding is not the only funding.
Those are the facts we have to deal with.
Environment is crucial.
First, cooperation.
The second area is ideas.
This means the European Research Council.
That will be more transparent.
The third area should be people.
They are doing that already.
We have structural and cohesion funds for solidarity.
We now also have an inter-service task force.
These should seek to achieve the same goals.
I believe these two things will be crucial.
We should bring more SMEs into the process itself.
Thank you for your support.
The debate is closed.
The present proposal respects these constraints.
I would underline the political importance of this proposal.
The Commission can accept a number of them.
Let me turn to the amendments.
The Commission can accept Amendment No 1.
We can accept Amendments Nos 4 and 5.
It is nevertheless a very expensive symbolic gesture.
This would be a much more meaningful response.
The FAO has not received any request for boats.
They oppose the export of old vessels.
That is what we must help them with.
Secondly: the practicalities.
How should we handle distribution and allocation?
Thirdly, there is the matter of ecology.
This would make it a better proposal.
I support the amendments tabled by the various groups.
The tsunami destroyed the coastal and seaside economy.
I thank you.
Worse, they could be a source of pollution.
My other concern is about the cost of transport.
Normal fishing activity cannot resume without intervention and investment.
Understandably, we want to help.
This proposal is well-intentioned.
This was a natural expression of emotion and solidarity.
Many thanks.
First, the question of the calculation.
Incidentally, they are not small boats.
Another question was about the age of the vessels.
We are not therefore talking about very old boats.
The needs will be assessed by the FAO.
We want to be ready if requests come in.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  â Mr President, on a point of order.
That is not helpful.
They do not want these boats.
At present, we have a request from Thailand.
The Socialist Group accepts that proposal.
Is that it?
Does he want to repeat the terms?
Â Â  âMr President, this is the situation specifically.
We are clearly opposed to it.
These are clearly not mutually exclusive.
It is actually funded by the European Union.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
I thank you.
This resolution was adopted by the UN Security Council.
We have consequently chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  .
For these reasons, I voted for the report.
The proposal bans unfair commercial practices.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Accordingly, I voted in favour.
That decision should be based on other considerations.
I saw at first hand the devastation.
Lend them the labour, by all means.
I completely agree with Mr Evans.
This statement explains my decision.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It confirms the ultraliberal tendencies of the Barroso Commission.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
A good working environment is important for all employees.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is the first consideration.
Consequently, I voted in favour.
I know that they work long through the night.
This is what they told me.
We just had the ruling before the voting.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the sitting is resumed.
That is what matters at the present moment.
There are two conditions for that.
That is a step in the right direction.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
It is all absolutely unbearable and intolerable.
The situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks, MrÂ President.
Many thanks, MrÂ President.
He sacked the Government and assumed direct powers himself.
Access to them has been restricted.
All military assistance should be stopped now.
A military solution is not the answer.
Neither can we ignore the actions of the terrorists.
The European Parliament cannot just stand by.
A few have been released since then.
I enjoy and respect constitutional monarchies.
As expected, widespread human rights violations ensued.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Many thanks.
Censorship and persecution are part of everyday life.
I thank you.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
Â Â  .
Therefore, the Commission has taken the following position.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
This agreement secures good governance.
However, Nigeria has given Taylor asylum.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
This is a tidying-up exercise.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
They are a visual demonstration of our solidarity.
No amendment has been proposed.
We cannot approve all of them.
I would support this as an alternative compromise.
That is very important.
Â Â  This is a complicated issue.
We shall proceed to the vote.
I wish to make two points.
Â Â  Which Rule are you invoking?
Â Â  Mr President, this is new.
Â Â  Mr Harbour, please sit down.
You do not have the floor.
At 12.30 p.m., the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, could you explain again?
That is an absolute disgrace!
You completely ignored that, Mr President.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Harbour.
Criminality imprisons people, it does not liberate them.
Do they teach children about it in European schools?
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
In fact, tomorrow at 7.30 p.m.
I shall receive the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Is there no sensitivity on that subject?
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs Gomes.
This week is also Endometriosis Awareness Week.
It affects 14Â million women across Europe.
It wrecks lives and families.
The United States took action six months ago.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Bowis.
I have taken good note of your request.
We shall deal with it.
The Finno-Ugric Mari people are currently suffering severe discrimination.
This murder must be condemned by all right-thinking people.
There is no other way to do this.
The law is the law.
Thankfully things are much better now.
Total Fina presents itself as a socially responsible enterprise.
This House cannot protest enough against this.
What happened in Lyon today is a disgrace.
Â Â  We must end the one-minute speeches.
Â Â  .
Can that be done?
I would now like to turn to the objectives.
This is something we wholeheartedly endorse.
It must, above all, help boost developments.
Â Â  .
Defaults have been minimal.
What is the EIB?
The EIB plays a crucial role in this.
I also hope that this discussion will be continued.
This is extremely bad news.
I thank you.
For my part, I am delighted about it.
This is a productive dialogue.
I think it should be continued with different committees.
International financial institutions have no depositors, however.
Nevertheless, we remain open.
A word about our activities in the European Union.
I also note the emphasis on microcredit.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
All these things will play a quite central role.
Who else is meant to do it?
Voluntary agreements are preferable where they are in place.
I also thank MrÂ Piebalgs for being here.
Why is this so?
There are two main reasons.
Â Â  .
Mr Caspary touched on some important issues.
The Commission is doing a lot in this respect.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
What are the companies doing with these great profits?
There is a great discrepancy here.
Consequently, we need to do more.
Is everyone a loser?
When will this change, Commissioner?
At the same time, energy prices are rising.
Consumption is rising.
We have enormous problems with energy networks.
We must ensure that the TEN projects work.
We have industry that requires energy.
MrÂ President, energy is power.
Â Â  .
I will make a special effort on energy efficiency.
This is expected to continue in the coming years.
Another example is the directive on biofuels.
Â Â  .
They are not a sound way of proceeding.
Â Â  .
I have not received a clear answer to this.
This then is more about countries than just companies.
These are, therefore, not trifling matters.
One or perhaps both.
Â Â  .
We need a better modal shift in transport.
We have a directive on biofuel.
I share the misgivings that Commissioner Piebalgs has expressed.
We have to do something.
Green energy is not a loss leader.
I challenge the Commission to achieve and surpass that.
The fact is that their ideological â¦
Â Â  .
The European Union has achieved remarkable success.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
You are debating that Community licence today.
This Commission proposal for a directive has three objectives.
There must be no place for social dumping anywhere!
Â Â  .
English is already the language of air control.
That threatens safety.
That is not English, it is EU gobbledegook.
Many thanks.
I believe the text meets all these requirements.
It is an exercise in Community regulation.
It is an exercise in harmonised regulation.
I now have to speak on the amendments.
I fully understand the logic behind AmendmentÂ 20.
Amendment 22 was tabled just before the plenary session.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
We think we have to say yes.
Moreover, improvements have been made along the way.
Now, the implementing Regulation must also be revised.
I would like to concentrate particularly on Annex IIa.
What is this debate about?
That is when the problem started.
Â Â  .
The wording is important.
We only have to do the maths.
Â Â  .
But the record shows that one Member voted against.
Let me explain.
Benefits are part of taxation systems.
We respect their stance.
That is a real step forward.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  The sitting is open.
And unfortunately this proportion is increasing in many countries.
There are worrying signs of a feminisation of poverty.
Progress has certainly been made.
Here, then, things really have been moving.
I should like to start with employment.
Your first question concerns two central problems.
Reconciliation remains the central issue here.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
Let us women therefore wish ourselves a happy anniversary!
These are the issues at stake.
Â Â  .
That is something I warmly welcome.
This is an epidemic in our society.
We need correct figures on a Europe-wide scale.
We all know about this.
It is modern slavery.
Where there is demand, there will be supply.
If so, so what?
We heard nothing about it.
This is entirely untrue.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you.
Europe cannot be indifferent to all that.
This is the right time for action.
It is as if we women had no skills.
Women are often denied higher education.
Women must be accorded the same rights as men.
There must be no violence against them!
Let us turn from Turkey to Germany.
Where is the outrage against these murders?
Such a state of affairs is intolerable.
The rights of women are human rights.
We are talking equality and not dominance here.
This is about choice.
That is what the debate must be about.
They cannot afford childcare or care for elderly parents.
Mothers cannot be fathers and fathers cannot be mothers.
Ideally our children should have both.
Then they can be properly liberated.
Thank you, Madam.
The legislative base is relatively solid.
This is a matter we must focus on.
We have a long way to go.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Unemployment, uncertainty, poverty, inequality, discrimination.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Many thanks, MrÂ President, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
We have two difficulties with paragraph 1.
Secondly, the paragraph is too diffuse.
Businesses also bear social responsibilities.
Social peace is dependent upon justice.
Â Â  . My group wholeheartedly endorses this report.
If only that were so.
Governments do not produce that.
The single most important factor is the common currency.
I thank you.
I therefore feel it is an unbalanced report.
I should like to highlight four issues.
The answer is very clear.
I fundamentally disagree.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Redistribution breaks the bond between success and affluence.
Thank you.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
First, the GSP will be simplified.
Second, the product coverage will be expanded.
The new GSP scheme is simpler to comprehend.
This will bring greater stability and much more predictability.
Let me turn to some detailed points.
The committee proposes a specific clause for El Salvador.
Any specific clause for Pakistan would represent a discrimination.
Â Â  .
Trade and development cooperation are very closely interwoven.
It is also a question of trust.
That is a missed opportunity.
Our group backs this report as now amended.
These amendments have deliberately been kept to a minimum.
Â Â  .
We want a British voice.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
I thank you.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
We shall now proceed to the explanations of vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Will they be insecure employees?
Under what conditions will they be working?
What would be the consequences of that?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
The elements in question were as follows:
Â Â  Relocations, unemployment, social decline.
What should we do?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I belong to the latter group.
The crux of the matter is the economy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
I come now to North Korea.
Investing in the Non-Proliferation Treaty is still a priority.
Signature of the supplementary protocol must become the norm.
Let us rid Europe of nuclear weapons!
Yes, they must.
Â Â  â Nuclear weapons are illegal and immoral.
The inspections conference is unlikely to bring a breakthrough.
What action should therefore be taken?
I thank you.
We cannot face this challenge alone.
Europe and the United States are complementary.
All diplomatic channels must be used to this end.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President.
I thank you.
My last point concerns the Korean Energy Development Organisation.
The debate is closed.
Voting will take place on Thursday.
We worked closely with MrÂ Hariri and his government.
Â Â  .
I said that this people was almost entirely united.
Firstly there is the Syria question.
Secondly, there is the issue of Hezbollah.
Â Â  .
Now the focus is on Lebanon and Syria.
The Lebanese Government has since resigned.
He signalled that Syrian troops would withdraw from Lebanon.
The sooner that is done the better.
The implementation of such a treaty is long overdue.
I find this entirely incomprehensible.
We are virtually all agreed on that.
The cedar revolution was also orange.
You do not want them to be independent.
What about the 40Â 000 occupying troops in Cyprus?
Why two sets of standards?
Not before time!
There are other possibilities.
There are others.
Why not look at them too?
This is coming from the people of Hezbollah themselves.
Hizbollah itself makes no such distinction.
I accordingly support the Commissionâs exploratory initiative.
However, this objective should not be selective.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Opening up the services market is an ambitious project.
The proposal to achieve this is innovative.
To be successful we need a broad consensus.
The debate had become too polarised.
Let me reiterate the areas I have identified.
I am prepared to be constructive and positive.
Â Â  .
It did so yesterday at the Competitiveness Council.
I will not propose a new directive.
No doubt improvements can be made.
I am ready to help in any way.
This leads to uncertainty for businesses.
Any modifications will need to be carefully examined.
The directive cannot be turned on its head.
I hope I have not spoken for too long.
The situation is now clear.
The ball is in your court.
I know there is a new wind blowing.
Thirdly, what will you do with health services?
I am sure that is quite clear to you.
What do you actually want to do?
They cannot afford lawyers.
What is going on here is a stitch-up.
That is not the Europe for us!
I listened to you very carefully.
Although in France today, when we talk â¦
Work with us!
We are going to significantly change it.
This image is disastrous.
This is stupid and dangerous.
We should not just patent anything!
We should limit it.
I thank you.
The country-of-origin principle is an integral part.
That is the first issue.
This is something I should like to have clarified.
I have two points to make, Commissioner.
A moment ago, you mentioned only social services.
Could you explain exactly what you mean?
Software is a language.
My question concerns the Services Directive.
What does the Commission intend to do about this?
My second comment concerns the content.
We have that competitive advantage.
Another part of Europe has other competitive advantages.
These are crucial issues if we are to succeed.
What does this position actually comprise?
I refer to both questions, services and software.
The criticism has been listened to.
Who makes the laws?
We want both of them.
We expect the same of the Commission.
This obviously must be changed.
We should already have begun Question Time.
Let us resume the agenda for the debate.
Fair play is all we ask.
Â Â  We have divergent views on this matter.
Â Â  .
I said it in the committee meeting I attended.
I turn now to the services directive.
There are always good reasons not do anything.
I have my own particular ideas in that regard.
However, I have taken the pragmatic view.
I have listened to what parliamentarians have to say.
I have been here on occasions.
Politicians are the same.
I will be as constructive as possible.
The debate is closed.
We shall now take questions to the Commission.
Why not involve the public as well?
He is reported to hold a French passport.
This is necessary and important.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is what I wanted to say.
Â Â  .
Thank you for the question.
Customs play a major role in combating counterfeiting.
However, enforcement remains weak.
Â Â  Commissioner, your reply was very encouraging.
I do think that this is a major problem.
Â Â  . Honourable Member of Parliament!
My answer to your question is a decisive yes.
Â Â  .
The Commission will continue to evaluate the GSP.
Is the Commission aware of this situation?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Has the USA informed the WTO accordingly?
Â Â  .
So the issue has been resolved.
Â Â  .
Has the âKinnock reformâ even begun?
Is it in progress?
Or has it perhaps already been completed?
Â Â  .
This includes a new career system and merit-based promotion.
In this sense a reform is never complete.
Â Â  (Thank you Commissioner.
Thank you for your answer.
Â Â  .
The EU institutions are working more efficiently than ever.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It will also enhance our competitiveness.
Â Â  The Commissioner made reference to Russiaâs reliability.
Â Â  .
But we should diversify our sources.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The honourable Member is correct.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
The situation is therefore quite clear-cut.
Â Â  I should just like to ask an additional question.
Does the Commission not see this as a problem?
Â Â  .
There is no doubt whatsoever on this.
I have already spoken about Estlink.
We will have another interconnection between Lithuania and Poland.
Is this sufficient?
Â Â  .
Thank you for your very knowledgeable answers, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
I have no comments.
That concludes questions to the Commission.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Voting will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
The first relates to the staff.
This should be changed.
Â Â  .
The Commission welcomes this report.
The Commission is open to that request.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President.
Â Â  .
However, Member Statesâ responses are often inadequate.
Sometimes they are simply not forthcoming.
The Council is rarely present in the committees.
Member Statesâ intransigence is also highlighted.
Without the resources, we cannot serve our citizens.
Â Â  .
In fact petitions are a strong tool for democracy.
That is very important.
Many thanks.
Citizens often complain about delays.
We are disappointing the citizens.
We keep them away from knowledge.
That is not our role.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Voting will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  .
The European Parliament is a new parliament.
The same is true of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
The Assembly started somewhat tentatively.
Now we see change.
We see few if any separate House votes.
We see a parliament of parliamentarians.
Now we look ahead.
We look ahead to budgetisation.
We hope that will come soon.
But a lot has already been achieved.
Â Â  .
My compliments to all those involved.
First of all, relations with Zimbabwe.
Then there is the resolution on Darfur.
The situation in Sudan is awful.
I should like to congratulate her on this.
Congratulations to Mr Bowis for the report.
Â Â  .
Mr Bowis talked about the committee's bedding-down.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Voting will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Section I â European Parliament
Section II â Council
Section IV â Court of Justice
Section V â Court of Auditors
Section VI â European Economic and Social Committee
Section VII â Committee of the Regions
Section VIII (A) â European Ombudsman
Section VIII (B) â European Data Protection Supervisor
[2004/2271(BUD)];
Â Â  .
Extra capacity in this sphere is huge.
Â Â  .
We shall return to this subject in July.
We therefore need more assistance.
I would thank MrÂ Dombrovskis for his efforts.
We are able to support his report.
That is not right, in my view.
This is incompatible with our voting system.
It is unfortunate that that was not done.
This point needs serious attention.
I want no further part in such a performance.
Â Â  .
We share our rapporteurâs concerns.
Â Â  .
Furthermore, the demands of multilingualism must be met.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
Where is the impartiality in that?
Many thanks.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Tissues and cells are often acquired through cross-border exchanges.
I would like to underline a key point.
Both the Council and Parliament accepted this solution.
This process led to a number of recommendations.
This will be followed up this year.
It is a postal order company for babies.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
So what exactly are we talking about?
We are familiar with the draft Directives.
Trading egg cells for payment should not be possible.
That must be unambiguous.
Action must be taken to stop this.
Many thanks.
This is just such a case.
That is the first clarification.
Those forms have now been changed.
It is monitoring the situation all the time.
The situation can now be rectified through egg donation.
Two main ethical questions arise.
The principal concern is the risk of exploitation.
A great shortage of eggs will arise.
That is what the British say in their answer.
They mention them in the same breath.
This should, of course, be controlled too.
We know of a great many such occurrences.
Â Â  .
However, it is not a binding rule.
I would ask you to answer this question again.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Voting will take place on Thursday.
Later today we will debate the forthcoming European Council.
These are broad economic, social and environmental objectives.
Nevertheless, we need to face facts.
This does not mean downgrading action in other areas.
The first is the balance within the Lisbon Strategy.
They are key factors for a successful society.
It is all a matter of ownership.
The Union must not be content with being ambitious.
I personally expect a great deal from these debates.
Â Â  .
This strategy must have faces associated with it.
First of all comes better lawmaking.
It needs a clear political direction.
We can learn from one another.
Time is not on our side.
Such is now our common task.
All these things we have achieved.
That, for us, is the starting point.
Â Â  .
Patents should protect innovation, rather than stifle competition.
Yet who is talking about the workers here?
There are many reasons for this.
This is impossible without economic growth or jobs.
The Member States must plan and deliver.
My conclusion is the opposite.
The Heads of State must take the situation seriously.
This we have set out in our second amendment.
Growth is worse.
Where has the GBPÂ 75Â billion gone?
Unfortunately, the Commission is willing to make concessions.
I thank you.
My warm thanks go to them all.
Let us muster the courage to fight mass unemployment.
That is detrimental to good decision-making on economic reforms.
First and foremost, cooperation between institutions has failed.
That constitutes âbetter law-makingâ.
The worldâs cards have been re-dealt.
Every continent has a good hand.
We need reforms, and we need investment.
Be careful!
That is what we are working to do.
What do we have to do?
What does that mean?
Fifthly, we need more leadership from the Commission.
Against what you have put forward today?
Against competitiveness, growth and employment?
We have no choice.
This brings me to my second point.
Honourable Mr President!
The euro has not kept its promise.
Small- and medium-sized companies are already benefiting from it.
That was a weakness in the proposal.
We include social and environmental sustainability in competitiveness.
The Commission speaks too narrowly of competition and employment.
Moreover, this is how it should be.
Is that possible?
Yes, it is.
That would be one method of sustainable development.
Whether they will have work twenty years from now.
My youngest daughter is nine years old.
Today we worked out our priorities.
It is a strategy of hierarchical priorities.
Transparency and comparability are at stake here.
This House is right behind you.
We do not need a directive to do that.
What must we not do?
What is important is for these to co-exist.
We are always an action plan away from action.
Commissioner Barroso and colleagues, please go for it!
What Mrs Doyle just said is correct.
This is something we must implement.
Â Â  â (Madam President, Members of the Commission.
Thank you for your attention.
This shows that Europe has tremendous creative ability.
Social exclusion produces neither more growth nor more jobs.
It would be a waste of time.
That is no solution.
Uncontrolled deficits are certainly not the answer here.
You must agree that is a joke.
It is not realistic.
It may create a genuine new momentum.
I am pleased about that.
Growth and job creation are particularly urgent objectives.
Your positive response increases our joint responsibilities.
Services account for 70% of our economy.
That is why the Commission is listening.
It wants to work with you.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  Mr President, I have an oral amendment.
Â Â  .
I will therefore do as you ask.
I voted for the report.
Â Â  .
They include the following;
Â Â  .
I voted for the report.
Â Â  .
This is a gross waste of taxpayers' money!
However, reform of the EU budget is essential.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
As I have always advocated:
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
EU history is replete with stories of this nature.
I wish the âLisbon Strategyâ similar success.
These three dimensions of development must be mutually supportive.
The risk of irreversible climate change is particularly serious.
Â Â  That concludes voting time.
The sitting is suspended.
This requires more than just words.
Yesterdayâs ECOFIN discussions were inconclusive.
Excessive deficits must be identified unambiguously and corrected rapidly.
We have a competent and determined Presidency.
We need shared budgetary discipline.
If not, they serve no purpose.
In my view, the answer is no.
Let us, therefore, take advantage of it.
There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
This report is highly critical.
It is honest enough to be extremely critical.
What exactly do we want?
Thank you.
Thank you.
It is almost too good to be true.
Now it is your turn over in the Council.
Â Â  .
There are sufficient fundamental reasons for doing so.
These two go together.
Different criteria cannot be applied to equivalent situations.
Unfortunately, Lisbon puts social policies in second place.
Previously he had said that the Pact was dead.
So what about this Stability and Growth Pact?
Of course the Stability Pact is wrong.
It is useless!
Dump it!
This reform is unfortunately enveloped in mystery.
That is not what Europe needs right now.
The Pact should not obstruct us in those endeavours.
So why do we do this in the Pact?
Where are we with European public services?
Far be it from this case.
I view that as something very dangerous.
Thus, this aspect appears particularly important.
One deficit is not the same as another.
Sustainable development cannot just be bolted on.
Â Â  .
That is important.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The Council now awaits a gesture from Libya.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have the most enormous sympathy for them.
They should be released immediately.
We ask President Gaddafi to release them now.
Â Â  , .
The situation is Kafkaesque.
We therefore have a responsibility to these citizens.
The EU can do more.
Mr President, this is an incredibly important issue.
How can the situation now be remedied?
I propose the following three steps.
These people are experiencing a major tragedy.
I agree fully with MrÂ Muscat.
We are indeed dealing with a genuine tragedy.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
This resolution is already five years old.
Does he agree with that?
Â Â  I fully agree with that assessment.
That much is clear.
Â Â  Question No 2 lapses.
Question No 3 has been withdrawn.
Responsibility for that attack has not yet been established.
They are here and they are working illegally.
That is the question.
There is a 'pull' effect in play.
That time is certainly drawing nearer.
What is being done about national football?
I wonder whether it could expand slightly more?
Â Â  .
Â Â  . Transatlantic relations are not limited to summit meetings.
That is the programme.
There is a great deal of money involved.
If so, which and how often?
Should there not be some coordination?
What penalties do Council members face in these circumstances?
What action is taken against them?
Â Â  . In legal terms, there are no sanctions.
That is very clear.
And we have no intention of introducing any.
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks, MrÂ President.
I have both good and bad news for you.
My question related to three other countries.
At the moment, there are no other applications.
You referred to other countries.
Is he still there?
That is a question I cannot answer.
I should like to thank everyone present.
That concludes Question Time.
Another chapter in the report concerns technology transfer.
Â Â  .
We want and need to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy.
We cannot compete on the back of our environment.
I could not agree more.
Both are needed.
Let me make a personal comment here.
I really appreciate this support.
It is crucial.
It is time to do something.
We need this strong signal.
It would, and should, be widely heard.
Even then, that is not enough.
Â Â  .
Research is the key to implementing the Lisbon objectives.
That is why this is a crucial area.
Examples might be hydrotechnology and nanotechnology.
This programme is the core of a development policy.
We need some pretty rapid responses.
It is like a shopping list.
All participants can reap the benefits that result.
The end is allowed to justify the means.
And so on.
There are many such questions.
EU research policy is on the wrong track.
I thank you.
Research is done by people.
I look forward to the rest of the debate.
Other slightly more controversial issues will require further discussion.
I will continue in Swedish.
The pan-Union coordination adds a clear value.
I thank you.
Can the Commissioner express a view on this?
Many thanks, MrÂ President.
I thank you.
I should like to make three points.
Thirdly, I would urge you to combine forces.
Article 169 offers the opportunity of combining forces.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
I hope that this will provide a good outcome.
I have five proposals.
Thirdly, procedures need to be made simpler.
I thank you.
As I said, it has become a necessity.
We must therefore provide greater support for such cooperation.
Â Â  .
The fourth is capacities.
Some of you mentioned ethical questions.
It is true that they are not easy.
Small and medium-sized enterprises have been mentioned.
We need to have a highly competitive European Union.
I have listened carefully to all your comments.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
and on data retention and data protection:
I should like to complain about that.
I know that the Commission shares these doubts.
That is why we are here tonight.
Also, are intra-European flights excluded?
Do you want to put forward your own proposals?
What is happening with it now?
Have you checked this?
I should like to have precise answers.
We need a clear answer from the Commission.
Â Â  .
This is an issue to be watched very carefully.
Talks with Australia are also well advanced.
Guidelines are currently being prepared.
Â Â  .
The procedure is extremely vague.
In other words, why is it necessary?
It has never been proven that it is.
Dutch research has shown the reverse, if anything.
The last topic is the âpushâ system.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in April.
The amount is not up for negotiation.
This type of behaviour must be stopped.
No, they must pay for this themselves.
I can only deplore this and find it unacceptable.
The Commission cannot support such a rigid approach.
Â Â  .
I welcome the integrated approach of the Commission.
Â Â  .
We considered it a brave and encouraging step.
I am very disappointed by that approach.
The voting list for tomorrow will speak for itself.
Â Â  Many thanks for pointing this out, MrsÂ Ries.
Â Â  .
There was very little time to consider.
Natura 2000 is a case in point.
That committee voted unanimously on the report.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Many thanks, MrÂ President.
I thank you.
Why is this?
Because the document itself is poor.
How would it be funded?
We need to ratify the position.
We farmers have declared our support for sustainable agriculture.
That was already established at the outset.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
However, I will take part in the debate.
Â Â  I take note of what you have said.
This has given rise to unusual trade flows.
The subject is a complex one.
I sincerely believe that we need an ambitious reform.
We have to offer them a clear outlook.
I therefore consider predictability to be a key issue.
Instead, a long-term perspective will be offered.
This will offset the loss in revenue.
I am currently exploring those ideas.
Let me conclude with the timetable.
The reforms have been a long time in preparation.
European sugar producers are ill served by this uncertainty.
European sugar production is both efficient and competitive.
In fact, quite the reverse is true.
Nevertheless, imports will increase.
They are no solution.
They will suffer through ill-considered so-called reforms.
Which direction should the Commission's legislative proposals take?
Such a solution would be a dangerous precedent.
That is a profoundly odd point of view.
Sugar production should instead be set free.
The concerns expressed about the developing countries are hollow.
Yet who will profit from this reform?
Will it be the farmers?
Perhaps it will be the consumers?
How about small producers in the Southern hemisphere?
There has been no investment in modernisation.
Thank you.
Some of these jobs have already been lost.
Reform should be based on the following principles.
It can be done; the technology is there.
We must follow the CAP principles we have established.
That should not happen.
Why would this not apply to the least-developed countries?
Small farmers, consumers and poor countries are hit.
Everyone must play his or her part.
Why is this resolution so good?
What does this add up to?
I do not share this belief.
Perhaps you could say something more on the subject.
Â Â  â Thank you Mr President.
We are threatened with a sugar fine.
It must also have implications for milk quotas.
The Everything But Arms programme is a relevant example.
That would be good news.
I thank you for your attention.
That is utterly out of the question.
MrÂ Graefe zu Baringdorf mentioned ACP and LDC countries.
I leave you with one last thought.
As regards prices, let me be quite clear.
There were quite a few questions on impact assessment.
Many Members have criticised the transfer of quotas.
Instead, a long-term perspective should be offered.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12.15 p.m.
These rural development funds also need to be strengthened.
Thank you.
For many years we endured it.
Many people were killed.
When will we have a European Prosecutor?
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
We must redouble our efforts.
Gestures are not enough.
We also need real action and budgets.
Authorising GMOs will result in disputes amongst farmers.
They will become dependent on the biotech companies.
Potential controls on GMOs do not guarantee effectiveness.
I thank you.
For some farmers this could be organic farming.
Local supply and local branding are keys to success.
It is âstraight bananaâ time again!
The EU believes that nothing should escape manic control.
People are selling food in pounds and ounces.
When they are caught they are treated as criminals.
Why?
GM crops are an experiment, by any definition.
A good scientific experiment needs a control.
This must not happen.
We now have an opportunity to encourage diversification.
Organic production is no longer a niche market.
It is the long-term future of agriculture.
Both sectors have a future, side-by-side.
Both must be mutual and complementary.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Mr Bowis, your comment will be passed on.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  Are there any objections to this addition?
Perhaps Mr RÃ¼big would say something about that?
I voted in favour, of course.
I voted in favour of the report.
Nothing has happened!
Â Â  .
Individuals and organisations should both have freedom of choice.
Â Â  .
They are ubiquitous and constantly on the increase.
That has to stop.
It is a despicable practice.
For many, childlessness is very painful and traumatic.
It would be a mistake to criminalise such agreements.
I voted in favour.
But it did not happen.
No mention is made of these issues.
I voted in favour.
This could have serious consequences.
Simply tolerating terrorism is not a good policy.
I would like to add another epithet: creative.
It is important to halt that haemorrhage.
I voted in favour.
The results in Finland speak for themselves.
Healthy ecosystems provide important social and economic resources.
Â Â  .
Many issues have yet to be resolved.
That is something for which we are directly responsible.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
The first one was sugar and public health.
Diabetes has now become public disease Number One.
The second aspect is Lisbon.
I wholeheartedly support amendments to this effect.
We must stop this absurdity as quickly as possible.
Unfortunately, not all of these were adopted.
We have therefore voted against the draft resolution.
The present system costs a lot of money.
The current system is not entirely to their disadvantage.
I voted in favour.
We heard that some were detained and beaten.
The case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche has become emblematic.
We again ask them to abolish the death penalty.
The visit taught us a great deal.
Tibet needs electricity, running water and hospitals.
I can provide abundant evidence of this.
I refer to the subjugation of Tibet.
The brainwashing process always concludes in the same way.
The question is: is this enough?
We see nothing of that at present.
That test is one that the EU must pass.
The EU must adopt a more consistent attitude.
I beg to differ.
Tibet must run its own internal affairs.
There can be no question of autonomy.
Thank you, MrÂ President.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President.
Another important development is political in nature.
Thank you.
It is only through partnership that integration is possible.
Suppression integrates nobody; it results in disintegration.
What can be done?
We hope that possible solutions will follow.
I have sent in letters on the subject.
They are being damaged for life.
There is no alternative.
Today we must continue what we have begun.
I call for our common endeavour to begin today!
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President.
In Belarus, however, the situation is worsening.
They can be found in every workplace.
Thank you.
The news from Belarus is really very disturbing.
I sincerely hope so.
They send out constant reminders of their existence.
There followed happy times for Poland.
The same should happen now.
I truly believe it could happen.
The situation in Belarus is like a black-and-white film.
I am not sure that it is too severe.
The country deserves a better future.
I thank you.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We need to act resolutely in this case.
I would kindly ask you to forgive me.
His conclusion is simply depressing.
We should be able to say so.
Â Â  Thank you.
Many activists are now under arrest.
Corruption is widespread.
We also support the European Parliamentâs resolution.
Thank you.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We have come a long way.
It is shameful.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
Â Â  We will now move to the vote.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
No amendments have been proposed.
That is something that should be explained to us.
Nobody.
Does anybody wish to speak against?
Â Â  Of course.
A point of order.
I should like this to be recorded.
It is the computer that counts the votes.
I am very sorry.
No amendments have been proposed.
Â Â  Does anybody wish to speak in favour?
Mr Salafranca.
Does anybody wish to speak against?
The item on Lampedusa shall remain on the agenda.
Mr de Grandes Pascual has the floor first.
Â Â  One moment please, Mr De Grandes.
You may leave the Chamber if you wish.
Go ahead, Mr De Grandes.
We wonder what the consequences of this will be.
Sometimes, actions speak louder than words.
I voted in favour of Turkeyâs admission.
Mr De Rossa.
Â Â  I shall take account of your request.
Mr Tannock has the floor.
We have problems with competitiveness.
Non-proprietary goods are not selling.
We cannot sell our products.
We have no tourists.
They go to the coast on the other side.
I believe that the Lisbon Agenda is in jeopardy.
Â Â  I have taken note of your request.
Mr Pek has the floor.
The European Commission tells us to wait.
Â Â  Only two requests for the floor have been registered.
Mr Medina Ortega has the floor.
I am going to give you the floor.
That is what Rule 145 says.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr Medina.
There are several oral questions.
Mr Cavada has the floor.
Firstly, more legitimacy.
Finally, we need more credibility.
To both these questions we expect precise answers.
We need more in the way of Europe.
It is a first step and an important one.
That is a lot!
Those with Albania and Sri Lanka have been finalised.
Mutual confidence cannot be brought about by decree.
Please, though!
The Constitutional Treaty opens up new prospects for us.
Next, fundamental rights.
Â Â  .
More and more proposals infringe data protection norms.
It is a slippery slope.
The two cannot be put asunder.
There is a serious imbalance, however.
The Member States are neglecting fundamental human rights.
So please: fewer words and more gravitas.
Why?
How did the United States get that data?
How did they get those names?
I have not heard anything about it.
I hope the Commission will answer these questions.
Thank you.
The same applies to the linking of police records.
My second remark concerns data retention.
That directive was adopted by codecision.
My third remark concerns the external dimension.
That is why we want the programme.
Much has been said on personal data protection.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the May part-session.
MrÂ Frattini has the floor again.
Â Â  .
Our proposal has two main elements.
That is why a monitoring mechanism is proposed.
The Commission proposal is much more specific.
Â Â  .
Do not get your own Member States into trouble.
Â Â  .
We aim for equal protection and for harmonisation.
Action on this by the EU is overdue.
What happened then must not happen again anywhere.
I do not question that.
Our group rejects such a solution.
That is obviously not in any way acceptable.
Instead, further measures will be required.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
We also endorse the budgetary amendments.
Â Â  .
We shall be voting in favour.
There is a great deal more to do.
I think I can work with himâ.
Â Â  .
I object to the target group being widened.
Â Â  â There is no reply from the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The rapporteur, MrÂ Markov, has the floor.
What should we be visualising?
What is the point of them?
What do we need them for?
What positive results have been achieved so far?
A flexible week was proposed, and rejected.
It is also feasible.
It simply makes no sense at all.
There is now a need to supplement this legislation.
The first aim is to simplify the rules.
This is why we are committed to simplification.
Is that even technically possible?
Let me give you two examples.
I no longer see any reason to exclude them.
Those, then, are the three aims.
There is no cogent reason for any additional delay.
Let me move on now to enforcement.
My last point concerns roadside checks.
Another consideration is that it would not distort competition.
Otherwise, the whole thing makes no sense.
We also need a realistic date for digital tachographs.
We have therefore tabled an amendment on this subject.
Â Â  .
So heaven help our truckers!
Does Labour represent them any more?
âInappropriateâ to give a UK view?
Private vehicles will possibly be next.
These proposals should therefore be backed.
At present, the law of the jungle prevails.
Yet legislation like this will cripple their very existence.
We must stop claiming that over-regulation means safer roads.
That is, of course, unworkable in practice.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Rack.
Mr de Grandes has the floor.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
This is about road safety.
That is very important.
Annex - Commissionâs position
The Commission can accept Amendment 45 in part.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate on this item.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
They combine higher quality with an increase in quantity.
The rapporteur for that report was MrÂ Izquierdo Collado.
I should like to focus on just two points.
Why?
Maritime transport is the most environmentally friendly.
The Commission issued a directive several years ago.
So what do we need?
Ships pollute to some degree.
Bold subsidies are needed.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Â Â  The sitting is closed.
We shall meet tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen.
Firstly, the Stability and Growth Pact.
Under this agreement the Treaty principles are maintained.
The substance of our messages was well received.
Their response was favourable.
I distinguish four key milestones for the coming months.
Our approach creates added value in three respects.
I am counting on your participation and active support.
I emphatically support what was said on Kyoto.
What are the issues here?
On that we are absolutely agreed.
On that we are absolutely agreed.
What has happened to Europeâs leadership?
Where is the sense of common purpose?
Europe needs and deserves better.
We see that as a serious mistake.
That is not what we want.
We do not accept it.
Â Â  .
Lazarus indeed strikes once more.
But it is not living, it is fudging.
Mr Barroso echoed those statements.
That is where the Commissionâs priorities lie.
Competitiveness figures prominently in the most recent Council documents.
The Council has not allayed these concerns.
I shall restrict myself to two examples.
Our Union is in a strange situation.
The facts, however, refute this pessimistic view.
Stability is unquestionably a public asset.
Unfortunately, Lisbon puts social policy in second place.
What we really need is economic governance.
We shall have more and more centenarians.
Climate change presents Europe with another challenge.
That is also our line.
Too little perhaps was said about the Youth Pact.
However, I am still very worried.
Uncertainty is very expensive.
The second policy area is energy.
This cooperation is necessary; it is extremely important.
You have to be tougher, Mr Juncker.
Nor do its citizens want it to.
It has actually been a total failure.
We can do no other than congratulate him.
Â Â  Each generation has its own challenges to face.
Please, take a brief look back with me.
To call this social policy is a disgrace.
And we have missed an opportunity in March.
You are right.
We have more work to do in this regard.
I shall explain why with the following example.
I would like briefly to raise another issue.
I do not see this as a realistic concept.
Allow me to point out four things.
Fourthly, sustainable development is a mainstreaming issue.
It is too easy to be pessimistic.
It is not.
What do I mean by this news item?
The goalposts seem to be moving further away.
Regrettably, the Lisbon Strategy statements remain on paper.
We are now called upon to go further.
A third point concerns the services directive.
Now we shall manage it.
That might be one message.
In the meantime, there was talk of liars.
Otherwise, we shall face the same problem.
This is a very major and difficult issue.
That is my observation!
I have witnessed this today and yesterday.
Something must be wrong.
Why was this necessary?
Anyone who says so is misinterpreting the Treaty.
I represent the European Council.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall conclude very briefly.
Our Europe is becoming increasingly complex.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
I cannot find this in the list.
Â Â  .
That is a major success.
Â Â  Mr President, a very simple procedural motion.
â1.
a.
b.
â2.
3.
This is the only plausible way forward.
Â Â  .
I am not that naive.
That will apply to all four texts.
I shall explain it very simply.
We have two different situations: Bulgaria and Romania.
Â Â  We must apply the Rules of Procedure.
They are grown-ups.
Mr Swoboda has the floor to speak in favour.
Â Â  Mr Nassauer will take the floor to speak against.
Â Â  .
We have overcome the interinstitutional problem concerning the budget.
Safeguard clauses have been built into the Accession Treaty.
We are therefore proposing that ...
We must not send out a message that ...
Â Â  .
Enlargement of the European Union is not a constraint.
It is a project.
It is a common desire.
I believe that that does not justify a postponement.
Â Â  My apologies, MrÂ President.
Calendar of part-sessions of the European Parliament for 2006
Â Â  .
Unfortunately, this amendment was deemed inadmissible by the authorities.'
Â Â  .
This is a gross waste of public funds.
British taxpayers deserve to have value for money.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Parliament should follow suit.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The example of Bulgaria speaks for itself.
Why all of these words?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
That is good news.
I am not opposed to Romaniaâs accession.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am in favour of future enlargements.
We have just experienced an enlargement without prior deepening.
This needs to be remedied.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Our constituents expect nothing less.
Â Â  .
We endorse Bulgariaâs accession to the EU.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We shall see the Councilâs position.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Europe will face enormous challenges in 2006.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The EPLP welcomes the directive on drivers hours.
Accordingly we chose to abstain on that amendment.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Nothing has been done.
These manoeuvres are absurd.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Did you like the Bolkestein directive?
You will love the European Constitution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
A new anti-grass roots assault is being prepared.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are at a real watershed.
Let me be clear.
Croatiaâs future is in the European Union.
The EU is ready, once Croatia is ready.
I should like to cite an example from Denmark.
We are entering an exciting year.
I quote from that report.
It is about the Western Balkans.
Then the matter that concerns us all: Kosovo.
This American model leads to stagnation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  (Thank you Mr President.
Thank you.
This would also stabilise the neighbouring Balkans.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Why is there unemployment?
There is unemployment because there is no economic development.
This is an important mission for the European Union.
Â Â  .
They are chiefly weak states.
It is as simple as that.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
I will now move on to my second example.
Reference has been made to the war on terrorism.
This is certainly one of the crucial problems.
We have just held a debate on the Balkans.
I remember precisely what was said.
We must provide solutions to the conflicts.
Cooperation with NATO has been highlighted in particular.
The national diplomatic services must become more widely involved.
One of them is effective multilateralism.
We have already made a start on implementing this.
These reforms really are important.
Guantanamo-type phenomena cannot be tolerated by the European Union.
We cannot act outside its framework.
It is a good concept.
Â Â  .
There are two points I would like to highlight.
Firstly, there is the military dimension.
What do we mean by internal or external security?
Which crises can we effectively prevent by civil means?
Â Â  .
I will deal with just one aspect.
Two points nonetheless.
Another problem that deserves more attention is nuclear disarmament.
Take a serious look at these criticisms.
Polemics have had their day.
We should guard against relying on public opinion surveys.
We need to face up to that fact.
It is actually bound to do so.
Poverty and injustice are fertile breeding grounds for terrorism.
We believe that the peoples are waking up.
Defence capacity is a of an effective policy.
Military capacity is essential.
We are fundamentally opposed to further European political integration.
The reports focus particularly on security and defence policy.
You cannot have more European security for less money.
That is defending the indefensible.
Thank you very much for your contributions.
Â Â  .
Of course we have not forgotten human rights.
This is part of the overall policy we want.
It is not only a problem in Bosnia.
Let us work together on that basis.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
We are working towards this.
I leave that responsibility entirely to you.
Â Â  .
They were rather exceptional reasons.
Â Â  We have a time-limit under the Rules.
Each question is followed by two supplementaries.
This is absolutely disgraceful behaviour.
Â Â  I think the presidency has answered that already.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let me answer Mr Evans.
Â Â  .
This is where a balance will come about.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is an issue that affects many of us.
I wonder if you could supply one?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The question needs to be addressed to the Commission.
Â Â  .
Please answer and do not say nothing.
Â Â  I turn to the Minister.
Â Â  .
There is a certain logic.
It seems that they are now in a bind.
That has never been seen as a condition.
That would be unfair on that country.
You have two choices.
Is anybody watching what they are doing?
Who is elected?
Who is coordinating and supervising this work?
It is very alarming if you say nobody is.
That concludes Question Time.
What is this about?
It was good for the whole of Europe.
So much for the industrial policy aspect.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
What leads the company to make this decision?
But we have a proposal to close Bridgwater.
Why?
How will the Commission tackle that problem?
Nevertheless, it is very important for the region.
This is a development that my group considers desirable.
Â Â  .
This is the ugly face of capitalism.
Â Â  .
Cellophane is a massively important commodity throughout the world.
British Cellophane produces approximately 60Â 000 tonnes per year.
It does not stop there.
It produces more and better quality goods.
The plant has done everything to stay profitable.
We should not allow this to happen.
I ask the Commission to take this up urgently.
There is cross-party support for this.
I believe that the WTO should act.
I urge the Commission to take up the case.
Â Â  .
If so, they run against WTO rules.
Â Â  â Good evening, Mr President.
I could give you similar examples in Portugal.
The EU has a common trade policy.
Such issues are regulated by the WTO.
That is called tax dumping.
That is known as environmental dumping.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
If so, what was the outcome?
The Commission knows nothing of any other complaints.
Â Â  .
That is true.
It is suspected that this company owns that bank.
I want the Commissioner to investigate that case.
We need at least 100.
I want an investigation into this.
It is not good enough.
The answer is that they did not.
What did accession to the Union mean to them?
VAT is one example of this.
This is also true of individuals.
They have given all they could.
Our demands are not unreasonable.
Unfortunately, all the ten countries are affected.
I refer to China and India.
What is the truth today?
To achieve this goal, Slovaks made great sacrifices.
At least we thought that way then.
What is the truth today?
This further deepens the legal uncertainty of employees.
This is particularly the case in the building trade.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Thank you.
This is an infringement of their personal rights.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The end-of-life vehicles directive imposed binding targets on manufacturers.
Let me now turn to the core issues.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your kind words.
Â Â  .
Which way should the European motor industry go?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The problem is two-fold.
Consequently:
Â Â  .
The European Parliament actively supported this plan.
Therefore, substantial preparatory work is already available.
We now have to start looking to the future.
Â Â  .
Furthermore, Unesco is drafting a global anti-doping convention.
One demand is missing from our resolution.
There needs to be a policy shift in sport.
The objections to doping are threefold.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12Â noon.
Â Â  .
The Commission responded to the invitation positively.
Negotiations are well under way in Unesco.
Secondly, we need an effective instrument.
What does this mean?
This is something for which we are all responsible.
Â Â  Thank you Mr President.
Thank you.
The resolution is very clear.
Â Â  .
Anything you care to name is on there.
This only concerns Member State cultures, however.
Cultural diversity is wealth for the whole of humanity.
It must not be subordinated to other commercial agreements.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
We cannot overstate this principle.
Â Â  .
It comprises five chapters.
Â Â  .
The situation of each species could not be compared.
Long may they continue to fish!
Â Â  .
We therefore trust that we will obtain your support.
Â Â  .
This is one of those rare occasions.
I, for one, share that approach.
Â Â  .
For these reasons, I cannot support Amendment 27.
I cannot accept Amendment 30.
This would not achieve the aim of sustainable exploitation.
I see legal problems with certain amendments.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
This simply involves an update.
Â Â  Mr President, the rapporteur has proposed the following:
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  All the explanations of vote are in writing.
It is a modern form of colonialism.
It shows amazing arrogance towards Europeâs voters.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Firstly, the directive attaches importance to the environment.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Therefore I vote against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The ESS lays down three strategic objectives.
Â Â  .
We are therefore voting against this resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Three more decisions are currently in preparation.
The second instrument concerns rural development.
When natural disasters occur, re-programming is possible.
They have to notify their plans to the Commission.
The situation for farming is giving cause for concern.
Â Â  â Mr President, my first word is solidarity.
Other measures are required, though.
Lastly, we need new European risk prevention instruments.
Mr Capoulas Santos is right in this respect.
One of our themes was climate change.
Sometimes it takes application.
Now is the time for action, then.
We can no longer wait for more certain answers.
That is one of our principle political priorities.
The figures are clear.
Â Â  .
This is an intolerable situation.
Â Â  .
Intimidation and violent attacks by government supporters go unpunished.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Mr President, this motion is ridiculous.
It has been a democracy for some time now.
There are parliamentary elections, parliamentary democracy and governance.
Three hundred thousand people have been killed in Darfur.
What are we doing about that?
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
That is what we are talking about today.
Like them, we lived without water or electricity.
The assistance they were receiving is being reduced.
The international community has no right to remain indifferent.
Its response must be commensurate with its responsibilities.
We came home and they stayed there.
European interests are at stake.
Peace and freedom for the Sahrawi people.
Â Â  .
The Commission has never interrupted its assistance.
However, it remains worrying.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Then we can confirm the situation everywhere.
Let us please not lose this element of civilisation.
The Commission, which was then under Mr Prodi!
Â Â  .
Meetings were held with the Gadaffi Foundation and UNHCR.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
There has been a technical glitch.
That has gone astray for some reason.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  .
The preparation process has been a detailed one.
The process has therefore been thorough.
The first thematic issue is a difficult one politically.
The second thematic issue is childrenâs rights.
It also deals with the issue of child soldiers.
This report very strongly supports the ICC.
The report also deals with many individual countries.
You do a similar thing in your report.
This is long-term work, we know.
We cannot go down that road.
First, the rights of the child.
The Commission then embarked on a large-scale public consultation.
We can only welcome that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I thank Mr Coveney.
I believe that is an extremely important chapter.
Â Â  .
NoÂ one can be sure of such a thing.
This is illustrated by the GuantÃ¡namo Bay situation.
Now of course many have been released.
The second trap is that of double standards.
It is the law of the genre.
A third trap is perhaps lack of transparency.
Let us look at some examples.
My third and last point concerns terrorism.
The rest, however, remains unsaid.
I hope so.
One abuse cannot justify another.
Another motive is nationality.
Do you not think so, ladies and gentlemen?
EU standards mean the erosion of standards as principles.
I congratulate him.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Let me give a number of examples.
Let me take this further by quoting Brecht.
This is after all a people issue.
A human rights policy cannot replace a foreign policy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
This solution may take various forms.
The situation has gone on for long enough.
Europe is the cradle of multiculturalism.
Â Â  .
But how can we cooperate when people are excluded?
Their political participation in elections is important.
Â Â  .
Where do they occur?
The problem is very often much broader.
It begins with the lack of education.
Together, we have to break it.
That amounts to one tenth of them.
I have documentation on the subject with me now.
So what must be done?
For example, there is the race equality directive.
We must address both issues.
Worryingly enough, discrimination is also on the increase.
I applaud the resolution.
The debate is closed.
I consider this to be an unacceptable act.
It seems this has already been discussed here.
Few exhibits, but they cannot leave one untouched.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, something is not quite right.
How can it be possible?
These investigations have to be carried out.
Â Â  Â That concludes the one-minute speeches.
In my opinion, this is not entirely accurate.
I thank you.
I therefore welcome it wholeheartedly.
Â Â  .
That is a fact.
This calls for a European benchmark and open coordination.
There is no shortage of problems to deal with.
The best solution is therefore probably a mixed system.
The healthcare sector has considerable potential for employment.
We are also living longer.
What can he do to reinforce it?
It provides security.
Modernisation is required.
Health, growth and employment are inextricably linked.
The patient is a customer.
Basically, there is no health policy.
Health and safety at work regulations are primitive.
Healthcare should not be a commodity.
Both issues are of major importance.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
I thank you.
Â Â  .
That review was called for in the original regulation.
The final point is the one the Commissioner mentioned.
Therefore maybe the amendment better reflects current reality.
I commend the report to the House.
I thank you.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There is nobody monitoring their health and safety.
Â Â  .
It happens to us all.
I would like to address two points here.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
But that is really not my cup of tea.
Then there is European-level supervision.
Â Â  .
We address similar priorities.
I broadly endorse the views expressed in the report.
Secondly, the better regulation agenda is important.
Thirdly, effective consultation is key.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The first concerns the rights of this Parliament.
We have accepted the Lamfalussy Process.
The Commission should give some thought to this.
Â Â  .
What wisdom did it bestow?
Let me end with a comment on European supervision.
The one must not wreck the other.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
Competition should be allowed to operate.
There is no risk of monopoly.
Allow the market to be self-regulating in this area.
It will attract investorsâ interest.
I believe in institutional competition.
I have two suggestions to make.
Here is the first.
Europe is in urgent need of it.
What problems have become apparent?
What action do we need to take?
Cross-border payment transfers are not yet fully developed.
Â Â  .
The integration of retail markets is complex and demanding.
Last week I was in the United States.
They offer a range of approaches.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
The Commission should therefore act as an ice-breaker.
Â Â  .
However, things have considerably changed with the enlargement.
Discrimination between EU citizens is simply unacceptable.
This report serves as a timely basis for it.
The situation has deteriorated since the enlargement.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I was keen to point this out.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Those are my points.
Are we going to have it before next week?
Why has it not happened?
Â Â  .
12 pollutants were identified.
Â Â  .
The Commission regrets this approach.
However, the process will be a long one.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Nonetheless, there are still some gaps.
Â Â  .
This will be a difficult issue throughout the Union.
This directive is needed.
It is one or the other.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
And when do we amend legislation in this Parliament?
Amendment 43 is crucial in this respect.
That will depend on which amendments this House adopts.
Another point is the ecosystems in groundwater.
Just a quick second point.
They have failed to do so up to now.
Ireland has not yet implemented the 1992 Nitrates Directive.
AmendmentÂ 7 and AmendmentÂ 10 should therefore be rejected.
We must respect differences in climate and soil type.
I shall go one step further.
We should eventually take this approach to everything.
The Nitrates Directive has been mentioned.
Farmers also need and want clean water.
It was never a comfortable directive.
Groundwater is a major national resource.
Most samples taken by the agency reflected unpolluted conditions.
These vary considerably throughout the Union.
It may well do more harm than good.
A similar fate must not befall the groundwater directive.
I wonder how Parliament intends to deal with those.
Â Â  .
Nonetheless, 48 amendments are unacceptable to the Commission.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
This is why I am making the following proposals.
A survey of entrepreneurs confirmed this view.
Simplification of current Union legislation is called for too.
Â Â  .
Certain old Member States have not done as well.
Thank you for your attention.
Politicians carry a great responsibility.
I hope we all belong to this group.
What should we do?
Â Â  .
The consumer is not being listened to.
My second observation concerns the problem of market monopolies.
The Union constitutes a large and attractive market.
This should be exploited with a view to regulating â¦
It remains fragmentary, restricted and protected.
Thank you.
We have to get a directive that works satisfactorily.
They cannot be separated out.
All these elements need to be in balance.
The record on this varies considerably.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place in a moment.
The Commissioner himself was here.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
That is why I tabled AmendmentÂ 3.
Is that correct, General Morillon?
Â Â  .
You lost that one, General!
Would you mind repeating it?
to replace by text
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The first paragraph is: â18a.
The second paragraph is: â20a.
Was that your point, Mr Purvis?
Â Â  That was my point, Mr President.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mr President, I have an oral amendment.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The June List has therefore voted against the amendments.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Pollution from households, agriculture and industry is increasing.
It reduces the quality of groundwater.
Â Â  .
The groundwater issue is partly a cross-border issue.
Â Â  I voted in favour of this directive.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of these amendments.
Â Â  .
Serious work-related accidents therefore continue to happen.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is a policy based on double standards.
Â Â  .
That is politically inept.
Why is this so?
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Schulz.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is the task of the UN.
Â Â  .
Among many examples, the report:
Furthermore, it:
Â Â  .
These two men are victims of political persecution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I will give five examples of this.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is where the differences are clear and well-documented.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
That has not been the case, however.
Miss Skride, your violin has the floor.
The following amendments have been proposed:
No amendments have been proposed.
No amendments have been proposed.
That resignation is too little, too late.
However, what happened was a disgrace.
No amendments have been proposed.
You will receive it very shortly.
No amendments have been proposed.
I wish our friends the ten new countries well.
The memory of these Greek Russians should be celebrated.
That is reprehensible.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
We welcome them to our debate.
Â Â  .
The Commission supports their case unreservedly.
Â Â  .
It is a call for real peace.
They can now put their words into action.
Time will tell.
I commend the resolution to the House.
We will fight to the very end.
Â Â  .
I should like to commend their courage and tenacity.
However, it is now out in the open.
Such agreements are just the framework for peace.
Â Â  .
Robert McCartney will never see his children grow.
They fear the truth.
The IRA is not the law!
Â Â  .
I am, therefore, going to speak personally.
They are in my prayers.
Â Â  .
We speak about justice and remembering victims.
This was a foul murder.
Hence the IRA-enforced wall of silence.
I welcome the opportunity to have this debate.
The provisional IRA has instilled fear into people.
That is something I would not want to happen.
It should do so immediately.
I welcome them here today.
They have refused.
Others who have any information should come forward.
It has not carried out a thorough investigation.
These people should be brought to justice.
They too must be condemned.
Why is the family looking for justice here?
Yesterday an article was written by Jim Cusack in .
The facts are sobering.
I support both those ideas.
I commend this motion to the House.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
Who are we then to claim the opposite?
A number of very interesting amendments have been tabled.
Â Â  .
This is where opinions differ.
I ask the House to support this compromise amendment.
Â Â  .
This is what we call common sense.
That is not a good idea.
Â Â  .
There are obviously two problems.
There is also the question of practicality.
I wish this directive well.
Is it safe or not?
We are well used to it.
However, it is impossible to stop it completely.
Scotland has miles and miles of splendid beaches.
Â Â  .
Several amendments seek to reintroduce provisions concerning emergency plans.
The Commission cannot accept the deletion of this category.
However, 21 amendments are unacceptable to the Commission.
The European Union ensures minimum standards.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
Â Â  .
We therefore need to ensure it operates effectively.
Â Â  .
This will certainly be a central issue in Almaty.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
Films bear comprehensive witness to our times.
The Commission will also promote cooperation between film archives.
Â Â  .
Film and filming is not only art and entertainment.
I believe that a good compromise has been found.
Â Â  .
Frankly, this is not good enough.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Europe is the cradle of the cinema.
My theory is as follows.
European films require an active response.
Such projects must be launched across the board.
Everybody must play their role.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
The preparations for this meeting are underway.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
My second question has to do with the texts.
I shall give you some examples.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Commissioner, Minister, I confidently await your replies.
Â Â  .
That is my first answer.
I will now answer the second question.
That is my answer to the second question.
I want to be clear on this question.
It is not merely an opinion.
Not much actually happened, though.
We do not have that much time.
Â Â  .
I strongly believe that cofinancing is essential.
European funding alone cannot achieve this for them.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This Regulation is not all-embracing, though.
Who is actually paying for what?
Of course, I am exaggerating, but still.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That does not aid our competitiveness.
Finally, this debate will boost consumer confidence.
Their responses were positive in every instance.
Terrorism is a terrible thing.
Î¤he ESÎ¡S is tapping telephone calls.
We have terrorism and fear of terror.
So let us protect our citizens.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you also for your brevity.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place at noon today.
Â Â  .
Why?
What about flexibility though?
That is what we see now.
Each of the Member States is different.
Each has its own economic structure.
Indeed, it would be extremely inappropriate.
Â Â  .
It has.
So let us nail that particular argument.
Â Â  .
The stakes are nonetheless important.
Â Â  .
It is very important that people realise that.
It is a health and safety issue.
But the opt-out is a big issue for us.
We are turning the clock back 85 years.
It is a mockery.
One day, three days, three weeks?
Â Â  .
The European Parliament clearly wants to see low growth.
This has produced good results.
This is a minimum directive.
Can we do without a minimum directive?
That is the first thing.
The second concerns our responsibility as legislators.
Does our responsibility stop at our national borders?
I have talked to all of them.
There is no mention of it.
The opposite is true, in fact.
Only employeesâ flexibility has been increased therein.
There is no need for further explanation.
That is simply not true.
I do not believe that people are asking that.
The issue before us today is: who decides?
SMEs themselves fundamentally disagree, and they should know.
The issue is: who should decide?
People want more freedom and more flexibility.
In many cases the Liberal Democrats will support them.
It is excessive and wrong.
That is no way to promote the Lisbon Agenda.
In this regard, the opt-out must disappear.
How many and how detailed must they be?
Let me illustrate that by a couple of questions.
And, if so, why?
And what right do we have to do so?
Please take your conversation outside.
That includes Mr Rasmussen and others.
We should work to preserve this model.
Nobody is saying that we should not.
It is right to have ever higher social standards.
Some countries have not yet reached that position.
So let us use common sense.
The opt-out makes no contribution to a social Europe.
That is not the way forward for Europe.
Let us vote to give workers freedom of choice.
The Commission cannot accept this proposal as it stands.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
You did not greet us by nameâ.
I was shocked.
Today, we are asking for that same opportunity.
We are very grateful.
Â Â  .
They can be proud of their country.
I have one oral amendment to amendment 59.
Thank you for your help and understanding.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen,
Nothing has been done, nothing has been decided.
Enough of these lies and false promises.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are therefore voting in favour of the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
and
We cannot afford any weakening of quality standards.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have thus voted against the present recommendation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I have two concerns.
Â Â  .
This would be confusing for the public.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We acknowledge that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There can be no exceptions.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The European Union will not do likewise.
I wish I could be just as optimistic.
I wish you much success in Bonn.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Many states there have decided to take action.
The coastline as we know it will disappear.
The disappearance of whole swathes of coastline is inevitable.
There are also too few resources for preventive healthcare.
Climate change is among these.
Thus, we cannot operate unilaterally through European institutions.
We do need to do something.
We have, then, really only just begun.
This is a tough statement, I readily admit.
That is something we have agreed.
We should make progress.
That is not enough.
We should take steps forward.
Targets were mentioned.
They provide clear guidance to decision-makers in society.
However, the timing of targets is very important.
That is the reason we opted for emissions trading.
The Commission is identifying and implementing concrete actions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
These arms escalate and provoke prolonged conflicts.
It shows why regional agreements alone are not enough.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The European Union should actively support this campaign.
We Europeans must continue to offer an example.
This project must be stopped.
Secondly, the idea of an international treaty.
We should not deceive ourselves.
There are three considerations I would like to mention.
Another consideration is this.
That is therefore nevertheless a very important factor.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on ThursdayÂ 26 May.
I would like to make a final comment.
I look forward to working with him.
However, I have some comments.
Which planet do they live on?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
I have a question about the ten priorities.
That is a step forward.
That applies to many areas.
The last subject to have been mentioned is immigration.
That cannot be allowed.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
They may be reapplied if need be.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for his answer.
Â Â  .
The Commissionâs services are analysing these requests.
Â Â  .
However, I would like to make three comments:
First, customs cooperation needs to be established promptly.
Secondly, how efficient is the December 2004 regulation?
Â Â  .
The Commission has now initiated further action.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you for that response.
Â Â  .
That means that the difficulties mentioned can arise.
Others have agreements with each other.
Â Â  .
Of that there is no doubt.
Â Â  .
Why is he quoting a constitution?
What is wrong with the Treaty?
I would like to say the following:
Â Â  .
They know what they are required to do.
We have proceeded on that particular basis.
At present we have privileged conditions for foreign companies.
Â Â  .
That is the situation.
Â Â  .
The Commission is undertaking ten specific communication initiatives.
Â Â  .
We are not involved in issuing propaganda.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We try to do it in different ways.
You did that successfully in Spain.
We are grateful to Spain for that.
You set an example.
Â Â  .
Interinstitutional cooperation is a key element.
Â Â  .
Our contacts with the national parliaments will also help.
I agree with you that these are challenges.
There is also a huge problem of misinformation.
Â Â  .
The conclusion is clear.
Â Â  Thank you for that reply, Commissioner.
In Ireland we are obliged to have a referendum.
The institutions of this Union have spoken.
Never mind the cynics!
Â Â  .
You used your 30 seconds well, Mr Mitchell.
The basic strategy has to be a national one.
You need to respond instantly.
Â Â  .
We have started a rebuttal service.
We are engaged in a rebuttal service.
I agree that it is very important.
Â Â  .
They have lied; they have made things up.
18).
Is there no requirement of balance and objectivity?
We cannot impose further demands.
Â Â  .
Question No 36 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  .
We need that park.
Â Â  .
It was more a comment than a suggestion.
Â Â  .
I listened carefully to your comments.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
My responsibility covers the structural funds.
Â Â  .
So this is all possible.
Â Â  Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
We discussed this many times.
We also had many talks with many Member States.
We consulted on those issues.
Will any resources be lost?
If so, how much and from which programmes?
Â Â  .
The deliverables of the action plan have been analysed.
Â Â  .
Can the Commissioner give me this information?
Â Â  .
Perhaps I was not clear enough.
The past and the future are two different issues.
Â Â  .
It requires good communication.
Â Â  .
Frankly, we are not flexible enough.
Â Â  Commissioner, I represent the West Midlands.
Important regional issues are involved.
Â Â  .
Nobody is perfect, as we know.
We all make mistakes.
It is a good sector to support.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The first is better regulation.
The CIP is aimed fairly and squarely at SMEs.
Â Â  .
All this work has started.
This is extremely important.
I can give you only a general answer.
I will inform my colleague of your views.
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time.
The points contained in the directive are fundamental.
The Treaties mention liberal professionals but never define them.
I still have two more points to mention.
Â Â  .
Thirdly, we are helping to reduce bureaucracy.
Their expertise will be very valuable.
This is a much-needed reform of the whole package.
These are part of the same proposals.
They are all parts of a clearly integrated approach.
This directive should remedy the situation.
That is, I believe, a happy augury.
I hope our fellow Members will recognise that.
My apologies for this.
I have nothing but congratulations and praise.
The definition is clear.
I consider this worth a debate.
This means that this directive complements the services directive.
Â Â  .
Some Members raised the question of the craftsmen or .
Let me clarify that.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
34 amendments can be accepted in their entirety.
21 amendments must be rejected.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That, in itself, is a sound approach.
Â Â  .
Poland has 450Â 000 farms producing red fruit.
Officially, 20% of the population are unemployed.
At least that will be clear.
Fruit and vegetables in the EU are over-priced.
In addition, fruit is overripe and tasteless.
You can do it.
That is not protectionism.
There is, however, a very simple solution.
It is not therefore necessary to overhaul it completely.
This is something we should think about.
More good approaches are required.
Â Â  .
We could do that using two different tools.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
I return to the proposal discussed today.
Â Â  .
I will try to give a short explanation.
I would emphasise â in rural areas.
Is this an effective and rational way?
This is clearly evident from the example of Poland.
In contrast, the starch-production facilities have adapted well.
This kind of attitude is unacceptable.
This state of affairs is also intolerable.
Â Â  .
Thank you for your contributions to this important debate.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
We understand that ethnic cleansing has virtually now stopped.
Peacekeeping remains the key issue.
They will not cooperate.
People are suffering.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
They could have done so.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
No doubt the rhetoric will continue.
Why am I saying all this?
What we need is a balance.
This requires joint action.
We also need coherence.
There is therefore a problem on both sides.
The position at the moment is very depressing indeed.
Let us head for the future .
Commissioner Almunia has described this perfectly.
The final point relates to development aid policy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
Ethnic issues are at the heart of political debate.
Well, these countries are on the drug-trafficking route.
I will summarise them briefly.
The human rights situation is getting worse.
Â Â  .
The Union is studying which steps to take next.
We should make this a new priority.
Why do I say so?
What is our objective?
That is ensuring democracy, stability and order.
That is close cooperation between those countries.
I invite all the Members of Parliament to participate.
Moscow backed an undemocratic president, and suffered defeat.
Allow me to quote just one example.
The truth is rather different, however.
That situation must end.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
, you have the floor.
Our troops have taken over from NATO in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
They claim to feel disillusioned with politicians.
Indubitably, faith in this integration has waned.
The answer is certainly not self-evident.
That is equally true with regard to its prosperity.
That is an illusion.
They are actually very different. [...]
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This principle is not disputed.
Â Â  .
We cannot, therefore, support the report.
Â Â  .
The European Union?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We therefore aim to mitigate its worst aspects.
Â Â  .
In particular:
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
However, we do not have any illusions.
Â Â  .
It even includes some backward steps.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We therefore voted against the proposal as a whole.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
They aren't.
This is more than a missed opportunity.
Â Â  The issue of regulating working time is complicated.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
Your presence here undoubtedly enhances our debate.
The duty of remembrance is a profound duty.
8Â MayÂ 1945 was also a day of defeat.
We ought never to forget.
What losses!
They were subjected to the law of someone else.
They were not liberated.
We say nothing against the will of the people.
How many lost opportunities!
Let us take pride in having achieved that today.
Let us first look at the past.
We therefore remember.
Hardly any country emerged unscathed.
Some found it simply by returning home.
Churchill was right.
What he said was astonishing.
We should not forget what Europe was.
So this transformation is worthy of recognition and commemoration.
Why?
Because it appears at times to be almost forgotten.
Doubts and fears exist, particularly amongst young people.
I never saw him.
European unification is a project of peace and freedom.
Europeâs wars became world wars.
Europeâs unification must benefit the world.
It is a hell.â
We are alive.
We made it; the Nazis did not.â
So many victims, so many names!
Three names out of 55 million victims!
Â Â  .
Tribalism and hatred are Europeâs ugly legacy.
Our historical perspectives are inevitably different.
Â Â  .
My parents left Germany 72 years ago.
There is no liberating ideology of mankind.
We have to talk about crimes.
So the Chinese get a few weapons.
So they are sold a few Transrapids.
Â Â  .
Thank God!
If I may quote him.
Yet this admission came too late.
Why is this so important right now?
Jean-FranÃ§ois Revel already spoke of â the totalitarian temptation.
I quote:
Dear colleagues, our history is your history too.
Our history is your history too.
The discredited political class disappeared.
Jesus says that the truth makes us free.
Another date Poles remember is 17Â SeptemberÂ 1939.
That must be our guiding light.
What war has it stopped?
Was Portugal going to fight Italy in the mid-1970s?
What possible war could it have stopped?
President Borrell goes on about the reunification of Europe.
I wonder sometimes what he is even talking about.
Does federation guarantee peace?
Unfortunately, our declaration did not say everything.
Only the powerful call things by their true names.
I call upon you to vote for the resolution!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
It will not succeed!
Â Â  Question No 1 has been withdrawn.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I must confess, I cannot blame them.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have just spoken about the Second World War.
Â Â  .
What action does the Council intend to take?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Is the Council aware of these facts?
Â Â  .
What are we doing?
I think this is what is important today.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you for that answer.
This is a serious issue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I have two follow-up questions.
My second question concerns the Euratom Treaty.
Â Â  .
Let us begin with the Euratom Treaty.
Â Â  .
What specific demands do you have?
Have you set a timetable?
Â Â  .
I have no comments to make.
What measures has it taken to resolve the problem?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I find this very heartening.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Why can we not see it?
It is of quite fundamental relevance to us.
Please give us an answer!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Question No 21 has been withdrawn.
Â Â  .
He is working in collaboration with the Palestinian Authority.
The appointment of two additional advisers is ongoing.
This work is very encouraging.
This type of cooperation is vital at present.
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  That is noted, Mr Crowley.
Â Â  .
I will discuss these four policy areas.
The next priority is to make enlargement a success.
The respective increases are 6% and 4%.
Â Â  .
What is so special about 2006?
The item is closed.
Â Â  .
How much money does the European Parliament need?
I really do wonder what it is doing there.
Â Â  .
That should be one of our main priorities.
Â Â  .
I wish him every success in the future too.
The rapporteur quite rightly focuses attention on budget presentation.
It requires continual development.
Â Â  Chairman, Madam Commissioner, distinguished House.
Last but not least is information policy.
That is a matter of dispute.
I will use all legal means at my disposal.
There will be signed motions to this effect.
Such economy with money is indeed praiseworthy.
Â Â  .
That is my clarification.
What Mr Lewandowski has said is quite inaccurate.
Â Â  The Commissioner for the next debate has not arrived.
Otherwise, I would not have allowed this exchange.
The President has written to Mr Martin.
I do not want to pursue this now.
You must be very careful about what you say.
You must not say that.
I am very grateful to you.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
That is just by the by.
That is the point we are addressing today.
Â Â  .
At the same time, duplication should be avoided.
Â Â  Commissioner, we began the debate without you.
Â Â  .
What do I mean by that?
That you have told us nothing.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
The European Parliament should not be merely consulted.
That will be the key issue.
One follows on from what the last speaker said.
I have three general points.
How will it handle its enormous multidisciplinarity?
How will it set up its chains of authority?
Â Â  .
This two-hatted Minister will have tasks of different kinds.
Development policy is not subordinate to other policies.
That is unusual.
That is what is stated in the draft Constitution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This is just a road map, however.
The path is made by walkingâ.
Â Â  .
However, Europe cannot do this on its own.
This has to change.
We made progress in Paris.
We cannot simply accept a 'one-size-fits-all'.
Let me finish there.
The discrepancies are too great for one uniform framework.
We should be able to customise our policy more.
We all know how the negotiations in CancÃºn went.
This should not happen again.
Â Â  .
We must re-examine this issue.
I have faith in you.
- an international economic organisation for international economic stability;
Quite frankly, this is unhelpful and patronising nonsense.
How can such an idea be asserted?
Â Â  .
The same applies, however, to our future.
I do not share their idealism.
It is not a simple matter.
Secondly, world trade must also be fair.
Â Â  .
I can assure you of that.
That is not what he meant.
But it is coming towards us.
I say that for two reasons.
That is something we need to bear in mind.
I think that impatience is healthy.
And I reject that.
Of course trade is not some magic wand.
That is at the heart of your prospectus.
I think that is very important.
Let me finish on this point.
Europe offers the most open markets in the world.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  .
These are important issues.
Â Â  .
It is important.
Now many have.
I shall first address the issue of textiles.
There are many who have serious concerns and anxieties.
It is clear why and I understand those anxieties.
This is being undertaken.
My services are currently analysing these requests.
Â Â  .
That is a good start.
What do you propose to do about it?
What progress has been made with enquiries into this?
Might I ask you to say something about this?
Chinese graduates are also moving up the value-added chain.
I hope the Commission will act swiftly on textiles.
Instead, they delay this crucial decision.
Â Â  .
It is a matter of cause and effect.
ArticleÂ 341 of the Constitution confirms this.
Â Â  .
I must strictly enforce the speaking time.
Consequently, we have strong ties with this country;
I believe that his approach is absolutely admirable.
That is the right approach.
So his approach is correct.
I should like to add one caveat, however.
What are the real interests at stake?
These measures help combat pirating and counterfeiting effectively.
There is no making up for lost time.
This is not about implementing protectionist measures.
Compliance with the treaties must be tested and demonstrated.
Commissioner Mandelson has tried to look at it globally.
What exactly do you mean by this?
I hope that this does not mean further delays.
Please do not let them down any longer.
September might be too late.
a) high-quality innovative products,
b) creating research and development centres,
These periods, these terms must be reduced.
Â Â  .
What we cannot do is act in generalisations.
Why?
So it is a mixed picture.
There are some very disturbing developments.
However, I am sure it will be forthcoming.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It is a community of values.
But it is not enough to want it.
Desires are not enough.
Only facts matter.
Amen.
Â Â  .
Apathy and ignorance are enemies of our democratic foundations.
We have identified five main areas for action.
The first is political commitment and ownership.
Commissioners will engage as key communicators about all portfolios.
The second involves professionalising our communications.
The third concerns connecting with and responding to citizens.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is a terrible idea.
Â Â  .
What is the dividing line between information and propaganda?
It is not very clear.
This is rarely the case, unfortunately.
None of us can do it on our own.
Â Â  Mr President, communication is a two-way process.
That is a good start!
That should continue to be the case in future.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen,
Do we in Parliament do enough work ourselves?
Thank you for your attention!
What is the cause of this?
Our votes are held quite separately from our debates.
That is what we must aim for.
Â Â  .
This is something for all players.
Thank you for the debate.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
I regard this as unacceptable.
Â Â  I note your statement.
This House should operate properly and within the Rules.
Â Â  I shall make that request known to the Bureau.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
I have already made this point on several occasions.
Legal action will be taken.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I wish to clarify the situation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are voting against this resolution.
Â Â  .
Many of the wordings are extremely commendable.
We therefore choose to abstain from voting.
Â Â  .
The second occupation.
Thank you, colleagues.
We must not allow this to continue any longer!
I call for this truth to be made public!
This is also important for EU-Russia relations.
I congratulate our colleagues here.
Our resolution opens the way for that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Their role in our future is of vital importance.
Â Â  .
The EP should be specific when making resolutions.
Fascism was born of capitalism.
Â Â  .
Other memories should not be overlooked, however.
We cannot.
If we want peace, we need the truth.
I have therefore chosen to abstain.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I reject the resolution for the following reasons.
Â Â  .
The rapporteur is right.
World trade is not fair.
Â Â  .
The really difficult decisions are still to be made.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It also overlooks opposing opinions.
We therefore had no choice but to vote against.
What is information about the âEuropean ideaâ?
Corruption is being reinvented, but at European level.
That is a good start!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let us therefore take this on board.
This really is the only topic that unites us.
In the name of Europe, is nothing sacred?
Just a few certainties.
Â Â  .
It is, nonetheless, fundamental that:
MrÂ President, I shall attempt to sum up.
Unfortunately, these are no isolated phenomena.
We remember the heatwave in France last year.
Unfortunately, drought cuts across national borders.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
The European institutions have not ignored this disaster.
We are counting on you.
I cannot keep so much livestock.
I have no water.
The animals are thirstyâ.
I want to say something more.
It is May, and it has not rained.
Why?
Â Â  .
I have now confirmed this.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
I am glad the Commission is committed to watch.
Incidents of violence ensued.
Under these circumstances, that is not possible.
Â Â  .
We vote in favour of the resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Russia is not a member of our Community.
Minority language education is threatened by the local authorities.
I wish them all the best.
Â Â  .
Culture is language-bound and language is culture-bound.
This is also a matter of democracy.
Democracy is not just about voting.
Â Â  .
All are minorities in their respective autonomous republics.
The publication of textbooks in Mari is practically non-existent.
This appeal has collected almost 10Â 000 signatures.
Pressure on Maris has considerably increased this past year.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen,
Of those, four million speak Finno-Ugric languages.
Thank you very much!
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The Burmese education system is falling apart.
UN diplomatic measures are also needed.
Â Â  .
Two things need to be given particular emphasis.
Humanitarian and social evils must be done away with.
Â Â  .
EU political sanctions were not debated during Burma Day.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
There is some confusion in this resolution.
Â Â  This sitting of the European Parliament is suspended.
I would like to welcome Mrs Blumenthal.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Mayor Oreja.
Â Â  Alright, Mr Swoboda, you are correct.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Moraes.
We shall deal with it during the next partsession.
It is clearly a problem for this House.
The rapporteur has expressed himself on this point.
Â Â  I take note of your protest, Mrs BerÃ¨s.
Â Â  .
It has taken some time to organise this gettogether.
Thank goodness for !
Was the relationship with Mr Latsis really purely personal?
Was there really no conflict of interests?
I suggest that he did possibly feel compromised.
We all hope that he will.
It can be done and it should be done!
Â Â  One moment, please.
Â Â  .
Thank you, Mr President!
What is the European Parliament for?
It cannot initiate legislation and it cannot repeal legislation.
It happens time and again.
Let me explain why.
This is a malicious allegation.
I well understand his difficulty.
Europeans utterly reject gutter politics.
It is entirely legitimate to have different political visions.
There are no political motives behind it.
That is something we are not prepared to accept.
Mr Barroso, you must feel rather perplexed.
We started a debate about hospitality.
This debate is a deflection from serious business.
Â Â  .
I want no part in this populist clamour.
I have still not been given that list.
âEURÂ 120,â she said.
Matters got off to a good start with Barroso.
That list is now at Bonde.com.
Provide us with the names of all the experts.
Let us see who obtains what from the budget.
Â Â  .
It matters to me.
You are sending out the wrong messages.
Without transparency, there is no democracy.
Wake up, I beg of you!
I just cannot accept that.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the next partsession.
What information is it that has to be protected?
I am very sorry.
We want more transparency in the Commission.
We do not base our policies on personal attacks.
This interpretation has proved to be fallacious and shortsighted.
That is the real wealth of our Union.
The negotiations have enabled considerable progress to be made.
Secondly, we have strengthened openness and transparency.
Â Â  .
It is a complex process.
Europe needs a strong European Parliament exercising its powers.
Â Â  .
It is now time to get to work.
Â Â  .
Yet this report itself accepts those same deficient procedures.
This is a step in the right direction.
Â Â  .
I just have two very short comments to make.
We are not anticipating the Constitution.
I hope for a positive vote tomorrow.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The conflict in Chechnya can only be resolved politically.
Terrible atrocities are taking place against civilians in Chechnya.
This concerns us all.
There is no internal conflict.
We have a limited ability to influence developments.
Â Â  .
Our aim would be the next summit in October.
This should be the aim.
Â Â  .
Positive developments have recently taken place in EURussia relations.
Our only hope is the development of civil society.
Â Â  .
The USSR occupied the Baltic States twice.
Russia must acknowledge the occupation of the Baltic States.
The answer is still in the negative.
We are laying down conditions here.
And rightly so.
Why the double standards?
And rightly so.
Â Â  .
Thank you, Mr President.
Modernday Russia is a heterogeneous country.
Â Â  .
President Putin obstinately calls this demagogy.
Â Â  .
President Putin himself has been very open.
We must continue in this direction.
This interdependence means that we must go further.
These are concrete actions.
Â Â  .
I have heard this in a different way.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
This complicated subject must be examined from various perspectives.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Our Union is entering a new phase.
Its main mandate covers what happens inside the Union.
Â Â  .
I would, however, add one important caveat.
These are not the actions of democrats.
Let me say two things.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
Â Â  .
The agency can be none of those things.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
This applies particularly to France and Germany.
He had absolutely nothing to do with that.
Unfortunately, we did not succeed in doing so.
I wish those still in hospital a speedy recovery.
This is what has happened in Belarus.
It is a controversial issue that ...
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
And today it is before this House.
This testifies to the importance of this text.
With this updated system we have progressed enormously.
This approach is now enshrined in the Directive.
We agreed on a compromise of 25%.
Money laundering â¦
There is no interpretation!
No way.
You should take the necessary action on this.
Â Â  I apologise, but there are technical issues involved.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There are therefore concerns about the position of lawyers.
We must also address the issue of terrorist financing.
We are aware that these are two different crimes.
We find this regrettable.
He has done a very good job.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These are all facts that must not be forgotten.
Many thanks, MrÂ Nassauer.
Â Â  .
I would like to thank you warmly for this.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Because what do we find?
I think that is a great shame.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Â The next item is the joint debate on:
This extension primarily concerns coaches.
This arrangement should apply for at least five years.
European measures are therefore required.
Why do we need legislation?
That agreement is not enough, however.
We must therefore have tests.
Bull bars can be valuable in wild landscapes.
They are of no value in cities, however.
Â Â  .
I hope that my fellow Members do so.
Â Â  .
I wish to thank you on their behalf.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
A variety of upper limits are also stipulated.
Annex III regulates the use of the other substances.
Â Â  .
First, I welcome the Commissionâs proposal.
If you do not know, come back.
Let me explain.
Technical aspects are increasingly taking over from policy ones.
I therefore support the introduction of nutrition profiles.
Â Â  .
They are neither necessary nor appropriate in this proposal.
The solution is much more complex.
Â Â  .
The proposal which exists today basically covers three issues.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Two amendments are acceptable: Amendments 11 and 44.
Â Â  .
It is something we all tend to agree on.
That is very important.
That is why we presented this proposal.
The proposal says something very simple.
Â Â  .
What is this regulation about?
It is about regulating food advertising.
Â Â  .
I have three points.
It is overregulation.
Of course advertisements must not lie!
No one wants that.
But we do not need advertising censorship.
This would deal the last deathblow to our SMEs.
We are making ourselves a laughing stock.
The food industry takes advantage of this.
There is a proliferation of all kinds of claims.
This afternoon, I had a lowcalorie drink.
We must prevent the consumer from being misled.
Deception comes in many forms.
The second point concerns alcohol.
We should not encourage the use of alcohol.
Nutrient profiles can be very useful.
I know that Member States use them.
I therefore want more specific arguments.
We also know that voluntary agreements do not help.
That is why we need clear legislation.
We should also correct the publicâs misconceptions.
This is not about banning products or advertising.
We have to be credible here.
Well, many of us have done so.
The Commission has worked long and hard on this.
And so we should.
This demands a very strong response.
We must take action here.
You cannot live without salt or sugar.
He mentioned REACH and the Services Directive.
Almost no foodstuffs are inherently bad.
Food consumption patterns are what is important.
This is a very sensible option.
Â Â  .
That is a very simple matter.
It is one thing to say consumers should decide.
I am sure the industry does not want this.
We are not banning advertising.
We are concerned with the message the advertising contains.
Nutritional profiles are important, they have to remain.
Also, the authorisation procedure is very important.
Notification is not enough.
But this is something which is open to discussion.
Â Â  .
It contested the procedure.
Therefore, we will adjust accordingly on the procedure.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
This draft regulation is of great importance.
My position on the amendments is as follows.
I regret I cannot accept Amendment 6.
Â Â  .
It has been difficult to administer the fund.
Personally, I would have liked longer deadlines.
I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work.
Their concerns are rather more basic.
I wish to address the issue of the technicalities.
In this case I hope it does.
That has to be avoided.
This is an area of great concern.
Â Â  .
I think this will be sufficient.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
This showed that competition really makes a difference.
That was more than speculation.
Â Â  .
This is certainly being examined.
Mrs van den Burg touched upon that issue.
I have just one more point to make.
There is competition.
It depends on what the market is doing.
We always keep an eye on situations like that.
Such things can sometimes be successful or sometimes fail.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The Commissionâs task is not easy.
Enlargement has made the Union even more heterogeneous.
Of course Europe could do better!
Â Â  .
Secondly, the fight against workplace accidents.
That is what Lisbon is about.
Then there is the social market economy.
We must have an economy that suits everybody.
Â Â  .
Perhaps the European Commission will take them into consideration.
Â Â  .
This could help greatly to create new jobs.
We still need new legislation.
These are our priorities.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is jobs and businesses that create growth.
What we need are reforms.
Growth is too low and unemployment too high.
We are encountering increased competition in the world.
The answer is no.
We shall see instances of restructuring.
How we implement them is important.
Finally: unfairly treated groups.
I ask them to support our Amendment 30.
Europe is not working well.
The first concerns methodology.
My second remark concerns the general climate.
A new independence is what is needed.
We need to complete the internal market.
I am not saying that this is good enough.
Â Â  .
I did not hear a response on that.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President.
Equal treatment must be promoted with practical measures.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  .
The scheduled date is the first of June 2005.
Please be quiet.
Â Â  .
We have strengthened the role of both institutions.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The rest is unchanged.
This Russian legislation was passed in 1993.
It has since been amended several times.
I ask for your support.
Are there any objections?
We would like to vote for that.
I hope I have clarified the situation.
This will be for the prosperity of Europe.
So we end after âpreventive healthcareâ.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .Mr Chairman,
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
These proposals are, however, extremely limited.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I think this directive is well over due.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Combating terrorism therefore requires unwavering vigilance and resolve.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is essential that consumers be informed and protected.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I voted in favour of this regulation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Nutrition and health claims
Public health and consumer protection go hand in hand.
Thank you for your votes.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
Â Â  .
This does not surprise us at all.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is why I have voted against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The June List has therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
My criticism lies elsewhere.
Â Â  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Very little time has been made available for this.
Question Time is a very valuable institution.
Please do not suppress it or let it disappear.
Last Thursday, we ...
Yes, and you were against it!
We proposed that last Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the one-minute speeches.
Mr Juncker, we place our trust in you.
Aids, malaria and TB are generally known problems.
I disagree fundamentally with that approach.
We see no sign of change.
She shows breathtaking courage.
This summer the world will be coming to Scotland.
I count myself a proponent of the EU.
The gravity of this situation should not be underestimated.
The timing in the present case is no coincidence.
Many thanks.
The European Parliament cannot merely react.
It must also act.
The Greek Government should immediately ban this anti-democratic meeting.
This House adopted it by the two-thirds constitutional majority.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Constitution is dead.
The Constitution needs a stake through its heart.
The European Parliament has passed 83Â Lisbon directives.
We must listen to the European people.
However, 55% of the French people voted .
Here, 82% of the Dutch members voted .
However, 62% of the Dutch people voted .
What is happening?
The people know a few facts.
We need to pay closer attention to the people.
Â Â  Mr President, this is a question for you.
That is what we need to be talking about.
The international community is doing nothing about this.
Nothing has happened.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  .
They must be situated on a priority axis.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Energy brings synergy.
Â Â  .
There will be interconnection from Estonia to Finland.
I strongly advocate the approach we have delivered.
Four countries have signed the Treaty.
We will continue our work.
For this reason, we cannot support Amendment 39.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Once again they are being wrongly allocated.
Â Â  .
She has had very broad support for her proposal.
The proposal entering the debate is an ambitious one.
Trans-European objectives are a good thing.
Â Â  .
That bear is the threat to our energy supply.
Forty per cent potential savings is a great deal.
Mrs Rothe, the rapporteur, mentioned public buildings.
We really must set an example here.
Worldwide learning is crucial here.
We all know that efficiency is absolutely essential.
Â Â  .
This is an extremely important issue.
Quite the opposite.
So it provides more opportunities than the cost involved.
I think a mandatory target is a must.
That is now the big challenge.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I believe there is reason enough for action here.
Â Â  .
The report concentrates on the previous year.
Â Â  .
What general conclusion can be drawn from it?
That is the problem with this subject.
This is again an example of an inconsistency.
How can the Commission solve this?
Has the Commission done anything with it?
This is an old idea.
There is barely any clear sign of improvement.
In contrast, the EU lets things slide.
When the money is used, all is well.
Every word of the article was true.
That was not the point, however.
Tillack still has not got the confiscated documents back.
Such information was also used in this report.
This brings us to quite a big problem.
I urge Commissioner Kallas to do something about this.
Â Â  .
Thank you for your comments.
Several speakers touched upon the subject of OLAF.
This is a major question.
Mr Mulder asked about the public prosecutor.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
I will mention a few of those amendments.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Why is this being done?
That is the goal.
Â Â  .
Mr Seeber is right in his comments on comitology.
I agree with Mrs Korhola.
There are just six amendments that we cannot accept.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
I look forward to hearing your comments.
Â Â  .
The first question is, what is reinsurance?
They panicked, but managed to pay their debts.
This is a business-to-business directive as well.
It involves competition.
It was therefore a question of collateral.
It was neither effective nor economic.
It was an old blunt instrument.
Parliament was able to vote on this in committee.
This directive enables us to speak with one voice.
Let us look at some of the figures.
A little more would have achieved a great deal.
Â Â  .
This is not a sexy dossier.
This directive takes us firmly in the right direction.
Not sexy, but significant.
Â Â  .
However, I was here for the speeches.
Mr Skinner also raised the issue of collateralisation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
So one can appreciate the difficulties.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The committee adopted the report with 129 amendments.
The other amendments I cannot accept.
It was good to produce this report together.
Farmers need the security to plan ahead.
Also the three axes structure and the Leader approach.
There is a lot more besides.
Finally, three amendments were tabled for plenary.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The need, however, is a desperate one.
Â Â  .
We are mad.
We need both.
Then we will have a future.
Â Â  .
I am in total agreement with the rapporteur.
Continued rural development in my country is therefore vital.
Can we not do better?
Because we need to do much better than this.
Support for organic farming is also important.
Â Â  I can only congratulate Mrs Schierhuber on her work.
I know that this does not depend on her.
We do not want to see further disintegration.
I hope this will also be borne in mind.
I would offer her my congratulations.
People are moving away from the countryside.
IT specialists and SME owners are but two examples.
The latter are of inestimable value for modern-day Europe.
Â Â  .
The financial perspective will be the moment of truth.
I thank you once again for your excellent work.
I completely agree.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Mr President, today is an important day.
Terrorism seeks to destroy free and plural societies.
Terrorism is incompatible with democracy.
Â Â  .
Terrorism cannot be fought in a generalised fashion.
What is a terrorist organisationâs main ally?
Here again terrorists win.
But what should we do together?
We need to safeguard financing.
The ends do not justify the means.
We cannot simply shell out money with no timetable.
This is the biggest cost.
All the early-warning systems must be unified in ARGUS.
What should we not do together?
We cannot create a climate of panic.
Nor do we want preventive wars against terrorism.
We have to remember these people.
Â Â  .
The danger lies in not reacting at all.
To my mind, these proposals complement one another.
There are also other threats, however.
Â Â  .
I am grateful for the communication we have received.
The most recent proposal dates from 24Â May.
Â Â  .
I keenly await the Commissionâs comments.
Â Â  .
That is no small thing.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Allow me to highlight a few of the issues.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There can be no concessions for terrorism.
Â Â  .
I would like to highlight two of them.
Â Â  .
This is a monumental task that we are undertaking.
Allow me to specify what it entails.
Â Â  .
The public expects a powerful European response.
Why can the same thing not happen in Europe?
Finland has also warned against data retention.
Such a move is downright dangerous.
It is simply a matter of opening doors.
Privacy is another much-quoted example.
This is essentially the priority which has been set.
I have also been attacked in my home.
I drive around in an armoured car with security.
I sleep with an Uzi under my pillow.
What are these victories?
People use terrorism in order to impose global control.
They feed it.
We have to see it as it is.
Is it fanaticism?
That is the easy answer.
But what feeds this fanaticism?
Were we always so honest in the past?
Perhaps we too are not quite so correct?
What is our stand today?
What are we going to collect?
We need to look at what is happening.
That is the solution.
Terrorism in Europe has become almost exclusively Islamic.
The first is impossible.
It is possible to achieve the second.
I wonder what specific problem that would solve.
I am therefore emphatically opposed to that idea.
That would make a real difference
The first is democratic control.
I now turn to three specific issues.
Firstly, data retention.
The Council should not ignore this.
President Putin has another definition: terrorist means Chechen.
The Chinese have other definitions.
The first weapon against terrorism is information.
Otherwise there is confusion and confusion must be avoided.
That is one point.
The second inadequacy is in the field of prevention.
That would contribute greatly to our political discussion.
I have five very brief points.
My final and fifth point concerns the Constitution.
Article 43 of the Constitution is a key article.
It is the one that deals with solidarity.
I would like him to answer the following questions.
Â Â  Mr President, terrorism threatens all of us.
Such action weakens our democracy.
That is not what we need right now.
We need to move in the opposite direction.
My final point is in relation to bioterrorism.
It needs to be targeted with meaningful controls.
Either way it is a waste of money.
Traditional police work is still faltering at European level.
A competent Europol cannot emerge in the current climate.
I therefore congratulate the rapporteurs.
Have they had an effect?
What effect have they had?
Are any specific measures dispensable?
It is always a question of proportionality.
Europe needs to lead the way here.
Anti-CBRN training for medical staff is being implemented.
This is rather difficult, but there it is ...
Another dialogue will be initiated at the appropriate time.
Welcome to the European Parliament, MrÂ deÂ Vries.
Â Â  .
There is a profound distinction between those two concepts.
We have spoken at length about bioterrorism.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
I would therefore ask you to support this amendment.
Â Â  .
We are opposed to that objective.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We voted against those proposals.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The same also applies to certain other Member States.
Â Â  .
Mass terrorism is the final stage of that process.
The June List has therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  .
Consequently, our group voted against.
Â Â  .
The most critical points of the Oreja report are:
Â Â  .
Â Â  The next item is the debate
In any event, we cannot suspend the sitting.
We must go ahead, Mr Barroso, Minister.
This will strengthen our negotiating position.
What is the state of negotiations in the Council?
The Presidency is continuing to listen to them.
Those targets will require additional financial resources.
I do not intend responding in detail.
Uncertainty often undermines the willingness to compromise.
Today we have a meeting of Ecofin.
That is where we are.
This is not about numbers on the page.
It would still allow investment in our future.
Let me be clear, once again.
We want a consensus for the next European Council.
We need it.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
Thank you for your positive assessment.
Â Â  .
Why these thanks?
The recent elections and referenda are proof of this.
That is what this House as a whole wants.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
For that I am grateful to him.
That is the conservationist side of our approach.
Â Â  .
How can we achieve that?
We should also ensure that savings are made.
There should not be excessively wide disparities.
Â Â  .
I have time to make one simple point.
Â Â  .
Does the new Financial Perspective change this?
Indeed it does.
Two obstacles remain.
Surely that cannot be the case.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
President Barroso has reminded us of that fact.
Â Â  .
My group supports this report.
A lot can happen in eight years.
What has the Dutch Government made of it all?
That is why we have tabled a resolution.
Â Â  .
We want contributions to be charged fairly.
That is not how things are at present.
The grand total for future expenditure is crucial.
What is wrong with the draft Financial Perspective?
What will happen if such inadequate solutions are adopted?
We are currently in an extremely difficult situation.
I shall firstly make a few general comments.
These, I repeat, are financially judicious positions.
There is no trace of that in this report.
Is this a sensible development?
The obvious answer is no.
Europe needs evidence that it still functions.
Some of us live in hope.
This is not going to happen.
Â Â  Thank you Mr Wynn.
In my opinion, this is a splendid phrase.
The European project is currently at crisis point.
Those are the sort of networks we need.
They said âyesâ.
Only the funds remain to be cut.
There are too many cuts and too many contradictions.
The so-called UK rebate also needs to be reviewed.
That was the gist of my Amendment 357.
We have to prepare ourselves properly for this.
This strategy will be especially important for nature conservation.
Today the Baltic Sea has immense problems.
There are major tasks ahead of us.
The Financial Perspective must meet these expectations.
I am opposed to renationalisation.
We can draw on good examples from the past.
Rural development is threatening to become one of them.
The funds from Natura 2000 must be mobilised.
We are all equal.
I should like to make one final point.
What do our actions do for our credibility?
It is there in this report.
The priority is absolutely the right one.
Our proposal is a compromise.
Your proposal envisages EURÂ 871 billion.
The Member States must not be timid about Europe.
That is not defensible.
My government says that the rebate is non-negotiable.
This is nonsense.
That is the price Britain should demand.
How?
Europe has run aground.
It boldly proposes new solutions for new situations.
But will anything actually come of it at all?
Aloofness and selfishness never lead anywhere.
Two political events are much anticipated.
The first is the success of enlargement.
This kind of negotiation is unpleasant for all involved.
I therefore address my last words to the Council.
Â Â  .
The European Union is going through turbulent times.
Of course we need to go for an agreement.
I commend it to the Council and the Commission.
In short, we must implement the Lisbon reforms.
I urge it not to do this.
Europe needs aid for research.
The Presidency proposes more.
Europe needs solidarity.
Europe must also spend its money more effectively.
That is a message that we must convey.
I am constantly aware of it.
Pass your resolution!
That is my appeal.
That is my appeal to the Presidency.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I would like to support that idea.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The results of this project can be expected shortly.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Madam President, I am obliged to the Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for that response.
This is a normal procedure that occurs regularly.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Commission has responded to the pact without delay.
Â Â  .
That is a very reasonable supplementary question.
Again it is about the financial perspective.
Â Â  .
This strategy, of course, excludes housing.
This could be an important project.
Â Â  Questions 39 to 44 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  .
I think this marks an important U-turn.
I should like to have this clarified.
Â Â  .
We believe that should be our guiding principle.
Very few questions have been answered.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That was an excellent, very helpful reply.
Â Â  .
The problem will be given serious consideration.
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  .
That definition is a very wide one.
So this report tries to take on two areas.
I shall deal with each of them.
This is a very important test.
The vision finds a strong adversary everywhere.
Â Â  .
This is why a monitoring system is indeed needed.
The Charter thus also has real legal significance.
Let us hope that this will be the case.
Â Â  .
He has been working on very interesting subjects.
We should be fair to ourselves here.
Â Â  .
Why is this so?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
They are the first not to want to integrate.
That is not desirable.
Europeâs diversity must be made visible.
Unity in diversity is not just a slogan.
I believe it is an excellent report.
Thank you.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
This is, of course, unacceptable.
The Member States must implement more proactive policies.
Â Â  .
The European immigrant-return policy also deserves much attention.
Â Â  .
Sometimes we have a rather schizophrenic attitude to immigration.
That is unacceptable.
People like that have built the United States.
They are dynamic and strong and we need them.
At the same time we need integration policies.
Immigrants should be fully included in the community.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Their pledges were incompatible with EU membership.
This is entirely hypocritical.
They feed tensions of all kinds.
This report takes a number of steps forward.
So finally the European Union is starting to move.
Let us hope that it moves in time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This discussion started three years ago.
That is also why I am not especially concerned.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Terrorism is the metastasis of modern society.
This also applies to what are known as gifts.
We support all the Commissionâs amendments.
Â Â  .
This, too, represents considerable progress.
And what good do these exaggerated excise taxes do?
They actually reduce overall tax revenue.
And health.
Do excise taxes really discourage smoking and drinking?
No!
Why not also with excise?
Â Â  .
We are engaged in progressively implementing both.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
Â Â  .
I should also like to thank the Commission.
This measure starts from people.
There were one or two other criteria as well.
However, the judgment was made.
A new opportunity had arisen.
We now need action, we need guidelines.
Now we need certainty.
The Watts case will be next.
Â Â  .
I am very interested in following the debate.
I feel confident enough in that respect.
That should be the rule.
Nevertheless, things change.
That is very important.
Â Â  .
I thank Mr Bowis for his excellent report.
We expected nothing less from him.
We are adept at exporting our patients.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
I already knew that.
Â Â  .
Waiting lists can be for plastic surgery.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you.
I would therefore speak for quality rather than mobility.
You are all sincerely welcome to attend.
European citizenship is something that we all want.
Â Â  .
But we cannot do everything at once.
Some things are easier or more urgent.
This has to be dealt with.
I am waiting for the conclusion of the discussions.
That is the first priority.
So it might be progressing better than we think.
So I shall give priority to gathering data information.
Patient safety is important.
Patientsâ rights are important.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
Is hope changing sides?
Does Europe now only inspire anxiety, incomprehension?
I do not think so.
Our institutions work, and will continue to work.
The European Council must therefore broaden its thinking.
We shall do everything to achieve that.
However, this is a negotiation.
It has proposed a new ânegotiating boxâ.
We must not avoid looking reality in the face.
Twenty-five governments signed the Constitutional Treaty.
There is no administrative, bureaucratic or technocratic solution.
It has never existed.
But could we perhaps talk about a plan D?
D for democracy and dialogue.
Europe is necessary, now more than ever.
Of course, the European institutions are not perfect.
Who could claim to be!
We must resist this temptation.
It is difficult, is it not?
However, there is a second pitfall.
That is why we recommend a pause for reflection.
No one has a quick-fix solution today.
We need to reflect.
We must be calm and collected.
This must all be reflected on.
Some of them are identical; some are not.
We have to take this into account.
It also applies to both Romania and Bulgaria!
That is what we now expect from you.
They need to be ratified.
We need an answer to this too.
The negotiations will be open-ended.
This will also serve to rebuild confidence all round.
This crisis has to be seen as an opportunity!
We are a union of sovereign states.
It cannot work like that.
That is why the process goes on.
None of us wanted to take this on board.
Why is there this gulf?
The public feel this gulf.
And there is a reason for this.
In between there are always the national governments.
It does not work!
It is as simple as that!
Enlargement must remain a possibility.
That is the unanimous opinion of our group.
That is why this Union has to do something.
It has to reform.
Â Â  .
Europe is too secretive and too opaque.
If not you, then who?
Once again, we are lying to our citizens.
The third truth: let us be clear!
What have been our failures?
Let us get to work!
It cannot continue to work that way.
Should we suspend it and wait for better days?
So, what do we do?
No, this time it is a different matter.
What do the people want?
They want to remain free.
That is the formula for the future.
Â Â  .
The future depends on informed consent.
Â Â  â Mr President, the die is cast.
The European Constitution is still-born.
Just one vote against sufficed.
We can dwell on that forever.
What is to be done?
I believe we should be guided by three principles.
The first principle is equality between the European nations.
You were living under dictatorships.
Others were living under totalitarian regimes.
The principle must be equally valid in either case.
Europe is in crisis.
Europe seemed to them foreign and distant.
We are all, collectively, responsible for that.
We must act now.
The matter is urgent.
Is it the victory of nationalism over Europe?
Did the social issue not founder there?
It was about the content of the Constitution.
This Constitution is now dead.
That is how peoples obtain the right to amendment ...
The surrounding the European Constitution requires adequate action.
Do their votes count for nothing?
There are all the other countries too.
How many countries should we allow to join?
How do we make Europe strong and social?
For what are we frightened of?
Not 25 national referenda but one European referendum.
How is that now to be proceeded with?
Stop tormenting the Constitution.
You are going to have a rather unhappy period.
History will catch up with you.
You lost.
These are the European Councilâs main challenges.
The French and the Dutch votes are irrevocable.
The message, however, is not clear.
What is to be done?
I would beg to differ.
I would therefore be against suspending the whole process.
Start afresh.
Read our proposal.
This should not be forgotten.
If I may, I will add a footnote.
We cannot live with the Treaty of Nice.
That has also become clear in this debate.
We may need more time.
That is surely wrong!
Let us actually give people these opportunities!
We need an instrument.
The Constitution failed to clear all the fences.
Did it lose solely because of European considerations?
I think not.
What have the voters said to us?
âSorry, we do not really know Europe.
This attitude has led us to a sorry state.
Enlargement has not been properly explained.
But it is a risky strategy in some ways.
Something else has to happen.
We need a common agreement.
It does after all meet in public.
It involves national parliamentarians.
It involves people from governing parties and opposition parties.
It would be the way forward.
There is no easy way forward.
They must say it, not us.
There are two possible solutions available to us now.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
We must turn our attention to these issues.
It would be futile and dangerous to deny it.
We must not give up so easily.
Otherwise, we risk collapse because of monetary inflexibility.
People react how and where they can.
I believe that the Constitution is necessary.
I should like first to congratulate Parliament.
Long may it last!
It is very much alive.
That is the task before us all.
I know of no magic formula.
Thank you again.
That too is a great political virtue.
We have an institutional problem.
We have to move forward.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The mask has slipped!
This will take time.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Please wait a moment.
It does not refer to any point of order.
That is normally enough for a group leader.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Bonde.
Please sit down.
Please do not indulge in parliamentary filibustering.
That is all on this amendment.
We were told that it was too soon.
Someone has to take responsibility for that.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Cavada.
It is 1.15 p.m.
So be it.
Â Â  .
Apparently this was not possible for procedural reasons.
Â Â  .
We have therefore voted to that effect.
Â Â  .
In light of:
I voted against this report for the following reasons.
1.
2.
3.
Â Â  .
We therefore reject the report by Mr BÃ¶ge.
Â Â  .
Explanations of vote.
Â Â  .
Natura 2000 finds that it has no budget!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It would only increase our farmersâ difficulty.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Maximum harmonisation infringes this right.
Â Â  .
This is with particular regard to three crucial questions:
Parliament must be genuinely involved in drawing up legislation.
We cannot, therefore, support the resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This proposal serves to plug a gap.
I believe we have a real opportunity.
Â Â  .
Let me turn to the need for stronger institutions.
The Security Council is the sensitive issue here.
The UN also needs to be made more democratic.
Is this a reason to delay the reform?
This is a major task.
Â Â  .
That is now a long time ago.
The story is old hat!
Moreover, no alternative architecture appears possible.
However, that is not the worst aspect.
That is absolutely meaningless.
These things will never happen!
The people do not want them.
Â Â  .
Laschet, my congratulations on your good report!
They are at work in their offices.
Our work is badly organised.
These debates should be dignified affairs.
There are too many responsibilities, too may targets.
This is a great innovation.
Do not aim for the wrong target.
That is a fact.
That is not what the Eurofanatics want to hear.
Corruption and a lack of transparency erode public support.
One civil war can undo decades of development effort.
It must be a peace-builder and a peacekeeper.
It must reform a stagnant bureaucracy.
It must sweep away a dysfunctional committee.
Why?
That is an absolutely vital reform.
We are unsympathetic to this proposal.
This reform involves many important issues.
I will restrict myself essentially to three aspects.
A greater consensus is needed.
Â Â  .
Some Members raised the issue of Security Council reform.
This is clearly an important and central issue.
The United Nations human rights system needs root-and-branch reform.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
However, we must stress that major problems remain.
Additionally, a strategic dialogue on Asia has begun.
Â Â  .
Transatlantic relations are at a turning point.
We are witnessing a new era of transatlantic unity.
This is a timely and welcome development.
There are three basic strands to our proposals.
We should consult routinely on current and potential crises.
We should strengthen cooperation in post-conflict assistance and reconstruction.
Our common agenda should prioritise the Millennium Development Goals.
We have a challenging agenda in front of us.
I should like to single out three of them.
That does not mean that ours are inferior.
Â Â  .
How can it do this?
I should also like to raise two points.
This is the key objective of any transatlantic summit.
Dialogue between these two key actors is not enough.
We must beware of sensitive topics, however.
What do we not mention in our resolution?
All these things are right, proper and important.
There are further hurdles to overcome, however.
A new agreement is needed to achieve this goal.
It has a very different role today.
We cannot ignore the outcome of this policy.
These have been mentioned.
Is this possibly because they such close partners?
That is perhaps a point worth further reflection.
Â Â  .
This stems from both sides of the Atlantic.
This is an important step in the right direction.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Should we use a stick and carrot approach?
Â Â  .
The European Parliament cannot stay aloof.
We demand an independent investigation of the events.
The full story is still very confused.
Who called the crowds out to protest?
Â Â  .
The Commission also remains active in the humanitarian situation.
The debate is closed.
Can the Council and the Commission confirm this distribution?
Â Â  .
A final agreement has not yet been reached.
The Commission actively continues to seek a final consensus.
Â Â  .
There is too great a shortage of customs staff.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Thank you for your answer.
It is a crime against the ILO Convention.
What has happened is very serious.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Patience seems to be a virtue.
Parliament has taught me something about this.
There is no logic to this whatsoever!
It should also take into account the level.
That is a particular problem in Ireland.
We need to look at this.
You mentioned taxation.
Â Â  Question No 8 has been withdrawn.
Â Â  That is very fair.
I find that very frustrating.
Â Â  You raise a very relevant and interesting issue.
That concludes Question Time.
I intend to divide my comments into two parts.
We want greater transparency and better definitions.
Different procedures apply to these two regulations.
We accept the proposal as it stands.
I hope for the necessary strictness here.
You will have even more responsibility for it.
I wish you luck with it.
We must stop elevating stability to dogma.
Stability is necessary.
The euro zone is sinking into stagnation.
Economic policy is not an exact science.
The opposite has happened, however.
Take the motor industry, for example.
I could quote many more examples.
My conclusion is clear.
This should be done by the Member States themselves.
They must achieve the actual implementation of all provisions.
Current economic and social reality bears out our stance.
This is why we are holding this debate today.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The examples are there for all to see.
Enforcement of the rules is the key.
The problem is not with the euro.
We have not been able to maintain it.
What could Parliament do?
What could my group do?
Let us simply review the economic facts.
Why?
I consider this to be a definite mistake.
We have debated this often here in this Chamber.
Surely the answer would be ânoâ.
That is the contribution of the Stability Pact.
We do not have to look for models elsewhere.
Consultation means something different in my view.
Â Â  .
Restoring confidence also requires a clear explanation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
It was both necessary and essential.
We need to go further, however.
Industry is the backbone of Chinaâs development.
Â Â  .
This has already been achieved.
You are going to see a new Commission here.
Â Â  .
But that harmonisation should also include a fiscal dimension.
Outsourcing has become a fact of life.
Two types of mechanisms exist for enhancing competitiveness.
All of this needs to be addressed.
He forgot to mention the Commission itself.
The challenges are huge.
That is where we must start.
The new Member States are bringing us this competition.
This is obviously something which is paradoxical to competitivity.
That is the way the argument is put forward.
Europe is not an ideal model for private-public partnership.
Enlargement strengthens the internal market.
The internal market strengthens competitiveness.
That also means yes to the Services Directive.
Mediocrity must be driven out of Europe.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
The Commission supports these amendments.
One of them even apologised for his ignorance.
So much for extender oils.
Â Â  .
I congratulate the rapporteur on his report.
Â Â  .
PAHs are everywhere and they occur as multicomponent blends.
This PAH is the best-known and worst carcinogenic substance.
Cancer has become the new Black Plague.
Â Â  .
The Commission has examined the problem carefully.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
I do not consider that this issue requires it.
I recall our resolution on the Lisbon process.
Such a patent would be extremely expensive.
Â Â  .
At present the situation is untenable.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  .
The compromise is not perfect in all details.
The Commission cannot therefore accept this proposal.
Each category should follow different rules.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 30 and 31.
Small-scale fishermen should also contribute to conservation.
One specific feature is small-scale coastal fishing.
I wish to make some general comments.
That is why this legislation is so urgently needed.
Are our present scientific data reliable?
Unfortunately, it would appear not.
Take tuna, for example.
The fishermen of Cyprus â¦
That is what the debate hinges upon.
Sustainable management of the marine ecosystem is essential.
I am referring to human beings.
Their accidental catches are now only residual.
The EU should not work on issues concerning fishing.
Â Â  .
The Community has to set an example.
It has to take the lead in the Mediterranean.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
You are well aware of how things work.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This initiative seeks to change that.
Their days are now numbered.
People's purchasing power has won the day.
I urge colleagues to support this report.
This is something to which MrÂ Stevenson referred.
Log sets kill sea turtles and many other species.
Let us consider the facts.
Broken nets spread death and this should worry us.
It is our duty to protect the marine environment.
That accession took place in Guatemala in 2003.
Â Â  .
The objective is a shared one.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
This is no coincidence.
And so it should be.
Why should we not share these with each other?
Appropriate institutional frameworks for this are lacking too.
Â Â  .
Parliament supports and upholds this step.
Â Â  .
It also pinpoints some of the solutions.
Nonetheless, we are not unfamiliar with this finding.
And what about tomorrow?
This is a stark warning.
All these are manifestations of extreme liberal tendencies.
The first of these is the family.
We need to find the right solutions.
Health care is no longer accessible to everyone.
The debate will resume this afternoon.
Inter-institutional cooperation needs to be better coordinated.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Pannella.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  MrÂ Laschet, I do beg your pardon.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Laschet is quite right.
You have come to the wrong conclusion.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The SGP thus became more politicised.
Â Â  .
It was about time.
That is not enough, however.
Â Â  .
Three key axes must therefore be put in place:
No, and consequently I have voted in favour.
Each country is responsible for its inhabitantsâ healthcare.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The UN is not suffering from democratisation measures.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
In other words, this is imperialism in action ...
Â Â  .
â¢ the reactionary reform of the UN,
We are opposed to this development.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The proposals that we tabled were mostly rejected.
Â Â  .
Local autonomy is meaningless without the necessary financial resources.
European values are universal.
I fully support solidarity with these groups.
Congratulations, Csaba!
Â Â  .
I agree completely with this view.
The fight will go on.
The debate is closed.
What is the international community doing in the meantime?
Not much.
The PPE was not on the podium.
So what happens?
Â Â  .
We are following the situation very closely.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
This led to anything but European-style parliamentary democracies.
Europe laid down the rules of democracy for guidance.
That they were released is another matter.
If only it could!
The situation in this country is worrying.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a moment.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Thank you very much.
Are there any comments?
Mr Hans-Peter Martin would like to make a comment.
Both items will be debated jointly.
The time has come to assess the results.
Hello.
I know people often react to my speeches.
The reaction is not usually quite so immediate.
Canada is also part of North America.
We should therefore congratulate ourselves on this outcome.
... it will be Europeâs failureâ.
Let us get things in the right order.
That was the package that was rejected.
It was a mistake to reject it.
We did everything possible to achieve it.
What a long way we have come!
What obstinacy in being unable to see it!
We cannot compare apples and pears.
Why try to compare when a comparison is impossible?
The two cannot be compared.
Today we have a disagreement.
This is essential â absolutely imperative.
In those countries, the debate will take place.
We have done so systematically during this Presidency.
Thank you MrÂ Barroso.
As regards Parliament, we worked together like twins.
Today, the European Parliament has reached maturity.
So, there is room for improvement here.
I regretted it and it showed.
I have no time for acting.
That is why I am disappointed.
However, I also had reasons to be pleased.
20 out of 25 countries is no mean achievement.
Not everyone can be De Gaulle.
I am surprised at my own modesty.
With enthusiasm!
This reform has neither weakened nor relaxed the pact.
We must talk about the European social model.
How can we modernise this European social model?
How can we avoid bureaucracy at European level?
More work is needed.
Genuine reform comes at a price.
But let us be frank.
Cohesion was more or less kept.
In fact, they were divided on the issue.
This must involve Parliament.
The negotiations will only be over at that moment.
This is wisdom itself.
We must look forward.
We must avoid that risk.
We are continuing to make decisions.
What follows now?
Is the glass half empty or half full?
Presidencies come and go, but the Commission remains.
What is our goal?
This House has already given its answer.
You were right there.
For that we are grateful to you.
The Council has not, and we will wait.
What is the Financial Perspective about?
It is about everyone making a move.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
You tried hard to strike the deals Europe needs.
That Europe must have the necessary funding to function.
We need another motor to replace it.
It must be neither British nor French.
Go home and make sure you win your referendum.
Â Â  .
Forget about agreeing on the details!
Let us summarise.
Â Â  I have often praised the Luxembourg Presidency.
What contempt for the law!
What a retreat from reality, too!
The Constitution is dead.
You are wasting time.
Let us, rather, start afresh.
It seems that we have overspent our credit.
The Luxembourg Presidency has indeed presided.
MrÂ Juncker is not one of them.
He is both an architect and a plumber.
Yes, Europe suffers from internal contradictions.
Europe is in crisis.
Etymologically, the Greek word means âdecisionâ.
Yes, the world is changing.
Europe has to adapt.
I have just quoted CarlosÂ Fuentes.
This crisis will not be short-lived.
Â Â  Madam President, no is no.
The Dutch ânoâ is final.
They fear that Europe will increasingly resemble the USA.
Is the Council prepared to start such a study?
I would like a response to that.
So why not hold a referendum on the euro?
Nothing changes.
It is a little too late, however.
The latter is something we should all value.
NoÂ one should make rash judgments either.
Who to choose?
Big?
Rich?
Active?
Â Â  Madam President, the EU is undoubtedly in crisis.
We have an enormous amount to do.
We must combat cross-border crime.
I would ask you to respond.
Both the Commission and Parliament have done their duty.
We must respect the commitments we have made.
The situation mow seems quite wretched.
Regional and structural policy also demands a solution.
The Council also lacks vision.
Two founder countries have already rejected it.
That is no great political issue.
I do not think so.
Wake up and smell the coffee!
We are ready for it.
From this, however, some good could come.
More Europe also means more money.
And to develop it into what?
The Luxembourg Presidency is now coming to an end.
It was a huge disappointment.
How do we reduce unemployment?
How do we implement social cohesion?
What social model should we follow?
That is what this argument implies.
We must continue with this debate.
Thank you for all you have achieved.
We should pause for thought but not be passive.
We need to listen more and talk less.
We must also learn from those referenda.
There were many reasons for the no-vote.
Nobody talked about Europe.
Everybody talked about their national interests.
We will have to return to this issue.
Secondly, on having maintained its referendum.
Now some words on the essence of the problem.
The leaders of nations have only themselves to blame.
Secondly, we need a positive vision.
We must avoid protectionism and we must avoid nationalism.
Roll on the British presidency!
Point one: procedure for ratifying the Constitution.
Enlargement also requires enlarged resources.
What would the European Union be without you!
Well, let us do it!
But let all twenty-five of us be involved.
Some want to speak about agricultural policy.
Perhaps now things will change.
No deal is better than a bad deal.
Part of that must be the economic reform agenda.
Paths are made by walking.
It is a major political and economic force.
Europe needs a clearly marked path.
Reform, yes, but reform in solidarity.
We will not have reform without the people.
We will not have reform without solidarity with everyone.
Who wishes for that?
Who would wish poverty on the rural population?
Who wants that?
We have no financial perspectives.
Much has been said about a fair return.
We want to open up a debate.
Â Â  .
What will happen to the Constitution?
How will this affect enlargement?
Has it already started to affect enlargement?
What will happen?
Will we get our money?
What happens to all our projects?
The European Union is a unique creation.
Second, this House must accept the agreement.
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.
Â Â  .
That is the legal basis.
What if these measures did not exist?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It was favourable and made two general observations.
In this new draft these provisions have been removed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The same applies to contributions to accident insurance.
The principle of subsidiarity must be our guide.
Such expressions are antiquated in a democratic EU.
Â Â  .
It is tragic.
The same is true for other items.
We will realise it.
Â Â  .
That is what people cannot understand.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
They include 75Â Auschwitz camp guards who escaped justice.
Most of these trials were conducted in Poland.
It did not happen.
The volume of fine dust will increase dramatically.
How can we possibly carry on along these lines?
This planned A74 is a motorway to hell.
We are poised to adopt an important instrument.
Â Â  .
We have taken a step forward.
Â Â  .
Wish lists are for the past.
I am proud that today we are legislating.
But what do we achieve in doing this?
Without a renaissance there is nothing for the future.
Why have we have achieved so much?
I have to thank my fellow rapporteurs.
Those people are so rarely thanked.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is the first step.
Thank you again for a very constructive report.
Â Â  .
Congratulations, Michael!
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These new programmes include security research.
It is, at the same time, operational.
Terrorism started to show its teeth thirty years ago.
Remember the aeroplane hijacks.
How does terrorism develop?
Who feeds it?
Perhaps they hit the big countries?
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Multipartite ventures are an indicator of confidence and mobilisation.
European growth is inconceivable without solidarity.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That will be the subject of a follow-up debate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The mandate of the ICANN is about to expire.
Â Â  .
The Commissioner and rapporteur have done some excellent work.
That is a problem we all have in common.
Two issues concern me, however.
The first is the funding of the action plan.
E-apathy is one of these obstacles.
This example is not unique.
We must now go one step further.
There is nothing new in this.
Unusually, everything has run very early tonight.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Do European citizens have rights?
That is the substance of this evening's debate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Indeed, arguably, I strongly support the organisation.
That way lies folly and further trouble.
Â Â  .
This is the only form of action possible.
Â Â  .
Some have committed suicide.
We need to distinguish between two issues here.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
What do we want?
Â Â  .
Jacques Delors was one of them.
That storm abated.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This is a timely address.
In every crisis there is an opportunity.
This is not just a misrepresentation.
Ideals survive through change.
They die through inertia in the face of challenge.
I am a passionate pro-European.
I always have been.
It always will be.
I believe in Europe as a political project.
For 50 years European leaders have done that.
When the war ended, Europe was in ruins.
There is no shame in that.
Failure on a grand, strategic scale.
It is about modernisation and policy.
And right now, they are not convinced.
Consider this.
The Constitution was endorsed by all governments.
It was supported by all leaders.
There are two possible explanations.
I believe this to be the correct analysis.
It is a crisis of political leadership.
People in Europe are posing hard questions to us.
Traditional communities are broken up.
Ethnic patterns change.
It happens within a nation.
It is happening in Europe now.
Just reflect.
Did it?
We are half way through that period.
Has it succeeded?
Are we listening?
Such a position would be absurd.
First, it would modernise our social model.
And we have been told how to do it.
We have introduced Britainâs first minimum wage.
Second, let the budget reflect these realities.
The Sapir report shows the way.
Let us put it into practice.
Third, implement the Lisbon Agenda.
Migration has doubled in the past 20 years.
All of these are issues we can concentrate upon.
Do they really answer the strategic needs of today?
Be under no illusion.
This is such a moment of decision for Europe.
The people of Europe are speaking to us.
They are posing the questions.
Â Â  .
It also raises high expectations.
But we cannot wait for 2013.
Some 200 pending proposals are under examination.
This is a top issue for the European Union.
We believe in Europe as a political project.
That is how it must be in the future!
You spoke about respect.
Let us go to work on Europe together.
You got up early this morning.
That is indeed the case.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  .
Thank you, Mr President.
You have every opportunity to show leadership.
So let me give you three suggestions.
First, Council transparency.
Change the rules of the Council of Ministers.
That is the nature of democracy.
Second, parliamentary scrutiny.
Third, public debate.
Last week called you .
Show it.
Prime Minister, I welcome your speech today.
That is old Europe.
Today, a modern leader must tell the truth.
You withdraw your signature.
Welcome to the club, MrÂ Blair.
You see, telling the truth is sometimes difficult.
You are right.
Welcome to the club, MrÂ Blair.
That is what we are calling for.
Let us make that commitment together.
I call on you to take an initiative.
You have spoken of change, modernisation and solidarity.
Very good.
I will remind you of four points.
Does this symbolic figure sum up this model?
Why are you ignoring them?
It is an issue for civilisation.
Where is the solidarity in that?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let us get real about this.
Who are these people?
What are these plans?
There is nothing to reflect about.
We hope that he can deliver.
So it is with the European Union.
The European Union has already done a lot.
Economic efficiency depends on social justice.
A third of our working-age population is economically inactive.
I wish you the best of luck.
I see your Presidency as an historic challenge.
It is up to you.
I shall then happily give you your examination certificate.
No!
Any objective observer must concede that.
Foreign policy will also be a decisive factor.
The Prime Minister will recognise this failing.
It is a quick win.
I want Europe to change.
Sticking-plaster politics do not work.
You should know that from Northern Ireland.
Ever-closer union has failed.
It is time to repatriate key powers.
The crisis was generated by the EU-15.
Let us adopt the Services Directive!
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
I thank you for that.
It is about doing these things simultaneously.
I therefore invite you to resolve this persistent contradiction.
Â Â  What a mess, MrÂ Blair!
I should like to conclude with one final comment.
An ordered rectification is required.
The 100 Yearsâ War has already been mentioned.
The great crisis is war.
The great value is forgiveness.
It was the aftermath of the Cold War.
The great value was sharing.
They need our support.
It is true for the developing countries.
Bravo on cancelling the debt of poor countries.
There is not enough in the bank account.
I therefore suggest that you travel to Paris.
Go to see MrÂ Chirac.
Buy him dinner.
You will see, you will be reconciled.
And that must not happen.
That is not the Europe that we imagine today.
It was a dream for 50 years.
We are disillusioned by the present disputes.
How much is Europe worth?
But we place a higher value on Europe.
Let us not put it at risk.
That makes no sense mathematically.
What are you going to do about the Constitution?
It requires openness towards the new Member States.
I also share his views on the Budget.
That too needs to be changed.
It bodes well for a highly successful UK presidency.
I would like to make two further comments.
So much for the Lisbon mission.
What about the common agricultural policy, Mr Blair?
What exactly is your intention in relation to that?
We are now committed to Romania and Bulgaria.
What we have here is a new situation.
That is what makes this situation new.
That brings us to today.
I ask you:
- Secondly, with what budget do you intend ...
And we need more Europe rather than less Europe.
Enlargement must be financed fairly and reasonably.
I would ask you to hurry up.
Alright.
Are you ready to listen to Mr Blair?
Then be quiet please.
Â Â  .
I thank everyone who has contributed to this debate.
It is good to see you here, Sir.
I agree with the agenda he has set out.
There is much in common we can work on.
Let us work on that together.
Let us consider that under our presidency.
These issues all need to be resolved together.
We support enlargement and will contribute towards it.
Obviously I have not reached consensus on that statement!
It is because of a sense of urgency.
It is serious and it is urgent!
That is not my determination at all.
There is a big difference between the two.
That is something I understand.
I want to make one other final point.
I have said why I support the Constitution.
But I will be frank with you.
They worry about the change in their daily lives.
This is a big moment of decision.
That is part of a healthy democratic debate.
I have found todayâs debate immensely impressive.
Â Â  .
It should not be seen as business as usual.
We must go ahead with our programme.
The European Union must avoid paralysis.
A Union requires the mechanisms of solidarity.
You can count on us.
We are going to our work every day.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  .
Before the vote
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Why is there no consultation on the Internet?
We represent our peoples and our Member States here.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The principle of subsidiarity should serve as guidance.
Â Â  .
I will be abstaining from the final vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Lastly, there is the question of timing.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The degree of uniformity is not sufficient for starters.
In the present instance, there was insufficient dialogue.
Account was not taken of all the objective data.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Cooperation is partly about supporting EU Centres.
Â Â  .
The evaluations of these programmes have proved very positive.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The June List has therefore voted against the reports.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This was not the case.
Â Â  .
There is the rub!
The stability of the euro will suffer from it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  We oppose the EU Common Fisheries Policy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The people are reminding their leaders of their existence.
The alternative to a European tax is European borrowing.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Reality is no mere passing detail.
Unfortunately, it was not to be.
I believe that this is possible.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our groupâs vote against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The EU is becoming more and more militarised.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Filip Adwent was a doctor by profession.
Thank you very much for participating in this campaign.
That is the reason for our request.
Â Â  .
I do not know if that is possible.
Here we go again!
This is quite intolerable.
I am very much against this proposal.
Let us keep Question Time.
Nor has the Commission yet produced its progress report.
Â Â  .
I thank you and I thank my fellow Members.
The matter has not, however, been resolved.
I would urge colleagues to support them.
We are not begging.
There are 40 to 50 illegal entries a day.
The memory calls for justice.
Suicide rates increase with age.
Therefore it is always difficult to interpret any differences.
Live 8 was a tremendous success.
In particular I refer to Zimbabwe.
We are now facing another human catastrophe in Africa.
What an indictment of his own people.
We must act.
A number of passes were issued to us.
The Presidency distributes those available amongst the political groups.
Thank you.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
That is referred from the Milan court.
All three cases involved prosecutions by the Italian authorities.
The Committee on Legal Affairs discusses immunity issues .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  No other Members have asked to speak.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The ECB advocates the use of the preventive mechanism.
That has not happened.
We owe this to the euro.
Consumers benefit from the strong euro.
To what is this attributable?
Credibility is in short supply.
Consumers were not born yesterday.
The responsible citizen refuses to accept this.
It is a problem that we can solve.
Â Â  .
For these countries structural reforms are very highly advisable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What has come out of this Pact?
Â Â  .
So how do we measure success?
Â Â  .
Dependency on any single resource leads to market vulnerability.
Real energy alternatives are needed to combat this.
This is the logical second step.
Â Â  We must thank both rapporteurs for their reports.
Short-term campaigns are not effective.
The workers have run out of patience.
However, an objective judgment is necessary.
For that we are grateful.
This is what citizens expect from us.
So rejoice!
I am a fervent supporter of Europe.
I shall confine my remarks to the Maaten report.
Such strategies will not change peopleâs minds.
This is not how things should be done.
Â Â  .
The issue of abuse must not be exaggerated.
That debate is now over.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President,
President of the European Central Bank.
I speak both languages.
It is good for jobs and growth.
I will mention two things.
A good monetary policy can do many things.
There are in fact other factors that count.
That makes three invitations in total per month.
We invented a new concept of transparency.
In addition, we have the press conference.
We debate issues among ourselves.
I can therefore fully reassure you on that issue.
Thank you, Mr Trichet.
The Council divides them into two categories:
Here the Council position is perfectly clear.
We finally reached an agreement.
The package of agreements contains the following:
Let me explain what I mean.
It deserves to be thanked.
It is a genuinely positive result.
These amendments are not part of the compromise.
Â Â  .
The scientific evidence is accumulating.
The danger is strictly the same.
Â Â  .
We have heard about that from the Commissioner.
We then have an obligation to take action.
That is what is entailed by the precautionary principle.
Â Â  .
Finally, I would like to thank Mr Trakatellis.
He stood his ground.
Phthalates are dangerous chemicals.
None of us want harm to come to children.
We are talking about linoleum floors with these effects.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
Â Â  .
Your cooperation has been quite seamless.
There is a growing global market for ecotechnology.
This imposes restrictions on direct financing by the EU.
The European Investment Bank should also participate in financing.
Many Member States have good systems.
Â Â  .
What more, then, do we want?
Â Â  .
We are talking about the fight against poverty.
Â Â  .
Bank financing has an important role to play.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
Â Â  .
Air pollution has serious adverse financial repercussions.
It is something we owe European citizens.
Â Â  .
Action is really desperately needed.
Air quality must improve.
The world needs clean technology.
Is that the Europe that you want?
Â Â  .
This is something we cannot accept.
Air pollution causes illness and kills.
Environmental protection promotes competitiveness.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Our Members now want a date for this publication.
Â Â  .
You said that I was furious with Mr Blokland.
I very rarely get furious.
The contribution of the European Parliament remains very important.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Security of supply is about keeping the lights on.
That is referred to quite clearly in the text.
That includes Member States themselves.
I commend this proposal to the House.
Â Â  .
Certainly in itself it does not.
This directive is an opportunity.
Â Â  .
It will also facilitate market access conditions.
Â Â  .
This market mechanism is very unfavourable for consumers.
Â Â  .
The result is extremely good.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
There are three issues.
No one here wants all software to be patentable.
What do the largest companies do today?
How can we face up to this challenge?
The best way is freedom.
Â Â  .
This has a spin-off effect which boosts innovation.
Â Â  .
A European Community patent should be speedily drafted.
What is the biggest problem?
This is therefore very dangerous ground.
Â Â  .
His amendments do not reject the concept of harmonisation.
They explicitly support it.
I reject this directive completely.
Today that is patently obvious!
Â Â  .
Patents are not a sword.
Patents are a shield.
They are there to defend ideas.
Â Â  â Mr President, are computer programs patentable?
Why revise this part of established law?
Why abolish copyright?
Applied natural science excludes engineering.
There have been many lies here.
Much has been said about innovation.
The first is the accessibility of patent applications.
And that Directive is in force.
That must be particularly stressed with regard to software.
That opens the door to the patentability of software.
Things were going well, so why spoil them?
Why do we need this legislation?
In fact, add India to that list.
I therefore support the amendments to reject this proposal.
Their opponents persevere and have sound arguments.
I think it is wonderful that they did so.
I would like to have a clear answer.
Therefore, the invention is always something intangible.
We should seize this opportunity.
The important thing is Lisbon.
The important thing is the knowledge-based economy and society.
We need this directive.
There are also other solutions for protecting innovation.
You all saw the demonstrators outside today.
Some of them were a little aggressive.
This has been an ongoing story.
Your lobbying was miserably bad.
The question then is what does this mean institutionally?
The European Parliament is a co-legislator.
You should take it seriously.
It contains far too many ambiguities.
Everybody realises that this is an extremely complex issue.
So why do we need a common approach?
This is not the case from my experience.
That should be stressed.
Copyright is there to protect software.
The Council is itself unsure.
What was the Councilâs response?
Such a world would emphatically not be modern.
Â Â  .
The directive cannot be turned on its head.
Companies should be motivated to licence voluntarily.
Various Members also raised the question of copyright.
So patents do not affect the existence of copyright.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The Parliament must vote against this legislation.
We cannot afford to stifle vital European SMEs.
SMEs are the lifeblood of job creation in Europe.
Copyright does everything that it should do.
Software patents are not the way to go.
Â Â  We now come to the votes.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
A warm welcome to you!
Â Â  .
A single institutional framework joins us together irreversibly.
We even note a paradox.
What does the future urgently demand of our Europe?
Â Â  Would the ushers please remove that symbol immediately.
Expel him from the Chamber immediately!
I said expel him from the Chamber!
If there are any, remove them.
I am sorry, Mr President.
Please continue.
Â Â  .
The enlarged Union will proceed as one.
Long live Europe, long live the European Union!
Yes, the young Europe.
You have said it very clearly.
Allow me to thank you once again.
I shall be very brief.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted for this report.
Â Â  .
Banning phthalates was therefore vital for public health.
Today's vote is a success in those terms.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This report has been a long time in coming.
Childrenâs health must come first.
Â Â  .
Hence our vote.
Â Â  .
Â· enhanced use of renewable energy sources
Â· balanced use of various types of primary fuels
Â Â  .
All these objectives merit support.
Â Â  .
That is why I voted in favour of immunity.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I have therefore voted today against this report.
Â Â  .
Nevertheless, we cannot accept this report.
Institutional expenditure of this kind is not acceptable.
Â Â  .
A Potemkin policy!
Or was it an optical illusion?
Nonsense!
The euro is synonymous with growth and prosperity.
Member States decide for themselves what currency they want.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This currency is too valuable to be discarded.
The initial effort needs to be kept up.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the Myller report.
Â Â  .
This is also happening in EU Member States.
Â Â  .
Child labour is a complex issue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We cannot turn a blind eye to this situation.
Child labour perpetuates poverty and hampers development.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
We must not put mathematics above all else.
It is the least the European Parliament can do.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This also relates to the construction of new housing.
We are satisfied with the results achieved.
Â Â  .
This corresponds to the proposal in my report.
The first of these concerns social inclusion.
I am grateful to all concerned.
I thank everybody for their help.
Â Â  .
I am not ignoring Mr Casaâs report.
Â Â  .
I will list some of them.
The report before you supports this view.
Perhaps I can give one or two examples.
The Commission accepts this.
We have to find an appropriate balance.
That is not a change from past practice.
It is merely a clarification.
We do not underestimate these problems.
The Commission supports you in this.
I should like to thank them for their work.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Respect for the internal marketâs competition rules.
Solidarity must not mean weakness.
These policies must be optimised.
The subjects of both reports are related.
These should remain available for this purpose.
Â Â  .
We are not requesting more money.
Â Â  .
There are, however, several real problems.
Those are areas under threat.
Finally, we must enable fishing communities to diversify.
Â Â  .
These Structural Funds are not something abstract.
These are not just words.
Actual use has to be made of this money.
We achieved a satisfactory compromise on the committee.
MrÂ Hatzidakisâs report follows these principles.
There is no good argument for this.
In regional policy this development should not be endorsed.
Conservative-controlled Kent County Council will love all this.
Why do IÂ mention this?
This is a rule that applies almost without exception.
We are not rivals, ladies and gentlemen.
For this reason, EGCCs are a reasonable option.
Why should not we opt for them?
Just imagine what would happen without a regional agreement!
The mere thought of this is horrifying.
Key words include specialisation and scaling up.
Northern Ireland which I represent is such a region.
I ask colleagues to vote in favour of them.
May this understanding above all inform the debate.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank the rapporteurs.
It may be undeniable that they need replacing.
These are ridiculous arrangements.
Countries cannot progress in this way.
The European Union cannot progress in this way.
People live here, not robocops!
Â Â  .
We have heard some excellent contributions.
Some of those concerns were very varied.
The outstanding issues are now clear.
I shall note three of them.
I shall concentrate on the European Social Fund.
It is good that the transnational dimension is increasing.
We are now planning to change that.
I would appeal for a degree of consistency.
Why?
Because the global demand for fish has increased.
That is what must take top priority.
The bottom line is that European structural support works.
We should fight for its political substance.
Let the rule stay as it is!
Fellow Members, please act responsibly and consistently.
This purpose will be our driving force for Europe.
This will in turn enhance job creation.
Do measures of this kind show solidarity within Europe?
Europe must display solidarity.
Why?
The large city issue is universal.
We must learn and innovate across Europe.
So, what is it we are saying?
We have lost out.
We will need further support.
It was a very short visit.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Aquaculture is made more visible.
Clearly, this must be further evaluated.
I am willing to look into this further.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12Â noon.
Then there is the issue of the headscarf.
Â Â  .
Let us be frank.
I shall give you some very concrete examples.
All this is included in the new penal code.
Kurdish women are particularly affected by these things.
Â Â  .
I would like to appeal to our Turkish associates.
It would be enough if action were taken there.
What are the real circumstances?
The murderers are free.
That is the reality.
That is the situation.
We cannot write reports from Brussels.
In mediaeval circumstances.
Prejudice is rampant against women.
The education system in Turkey cultivates it.
That is the retrogression of women in Turkey.
I offer my congratulations.
Are women in Turkey really subject to discrimination?
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It has an economic value.
Â Â  .
The first matter concerns equal pay for equal work.
This runs counter to the resolutionâs declarations.
This House is contributing its own.
That is why I welcome this proposal.
What about your actual timetable?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let me touch on some of those debates.
The record to date is patchy.
Courts often avoid the application of foreign law.
Finally to our old friend: the country-of-origin principle.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The process is a difficult one.
You told us that you had received an undertaking.
How can we check that it is complied with?
Â Â  .
Where did Mexico get the data?
It has now been postponed until September.
Could the Commissioner shed some light on that?
Â Â  â Mr President, I shall speak in Greek.
I ask for your forbearance.
These are not my questions.
Â Â  .
I refer in particular to the so-called no-fly list.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
There was the Pourgourides report on politically motivated disappearances.
We have two objectives.
I hope that the results will be excellent.
This is not the case.
We need to help the Belarussians make their choice.
There is one additional point we should not forget.
That really would be the end.
Other instruments are needed for that country.
We must support them from outside.
EU policy must provide a response to such goings-on.
You leave us no other choice, Commissioner.
How can this process of mankurtism be halted?
I call on you to support this resolution.
However, please let us get things going.
Let us change the rules.
Let us see what we can do.
Â Â  .
Why?
I am always flexible and open.
The Council came after us.
This is the real crux of the problem.
Of course we are.
We should also work via Ukraine.
In the Commission, it is more complex.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That goes far beyond the cross-regional cumulation.
I have three questions to ask in this respect.
The first concerns cumulation.
How does the Commission think it will achieve this?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We clearly share the same objectives.
We must ensure that we deliver our promises.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Of course, this conclusion is not enough.
Very specific measures also need to be taken.
However, in my opinion, it is necessary.
The third comment I have to make concerns reconstruction.
Â Â  .
Apologies for my pronunciation.
That strategy is bearing fruit.
There is no disguising that.
Leave aside the arguments of the past.
The security situation is poor.
Whether we can achieve that remains to be seen.
I look forward to today's debate
Â Â  .
I congratulate Mr Dimitrakopoulos warmly on his report.
I see two concrete prerequisites for this.
There were no votes against the opinion.
What does this mean in terms of trade policy?
Â Â  .
I am turning it.
I shall not give any figures.
I am turning the page.
That is our bottom line.
Why?
We do not need to dig ourselves into trenches.
The Iraqi people are courageous and patient.
The first one is the deteriorating security situation.
It is ethically irresponsible.
You owe us some explanations!
How?
Corruption and security are closely related.
The new Iraqi Government is demonstrating this to us.
Many deficiencies, however, still remain.
This is truly the last turning point.
Before the war in Iraq there was no terrorism.
That is the truth.
The occupying forces must leave.
They need to understand that.
That is the real truth.
We have lived through it.
The occupying army must leave.
That is the right thing to do.
Let us speak the truth.
We should not be ashamed.
Long live democracy.
Long live freedom.
Long live self-determination.
Those who do not fight are our partners.
The cost of failure would be high.
That is a brave new call.
Everyone should vote against that amendment.
Â Â  .
That is the only solution.
That must be an inclusive approach.
Of course we have to look to the constitution.
Therefore, the constitution is of the greatest importance.
People must be allowed to live their lives.
We know how difficult it is.
Conditions on the ground are exceedingly difficult.
We support the WTO proposals regarding Iraq.
Â Â  .
I still do.
I respect those who take a different view.
With respect, that is wrong.
Yes, the situation in Iraq today is serious.
There have been very few incidents.
Why?
Because the terrorism there has been defeated.
I am not naive.
I thank you very much for that.
It is well illustrated by todayâs debate.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon today.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
Â Â  .
Mrs Morgantini has submitted to me some detailed questions.
The story is the same on security and defence.
EU missions there and in Macedonia are training police.
We are also training Iraqi police and judiciary.
We are assisting the African Union force in Sudan.
Nowhere is that more important than in Africa.
Mandela was right.
Millions have had to flee their homes.
However, we have to do more.
Why?
Let us hope that it will.
Africa has changed.
If Africa has changed, Europe too has changed.
Finally, the world has changed.
In any case, I see no better one.
On what should this marriage be based?
The first axis is governance.
Africa, however, is starting to move.
This mechanism deserves our full support.
The second axis is infrastructure and networks.
The European Union itself is proof of that.
The third axis is, obviously, trade.
Clearly we have to reverse this trend.
Finally, the last axis is culture.
It is, however, vital.
I have heard talk of sanctions.
It would be useful to open this debate.
Â Â  .
Africa has strong resources that we can use.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is an act of justice.
Now that pledge has slipped to 2030.
The last century saw millions killed in wars.
A round for free?
I wish you success.
We are still a long way from that.
Our action must be clear.
I want to highlight two important conclusions.
Â Â  â Mr President, behind one Martinez lurks another!
So, what are we to do?
There are now no ifs or buts or whens.
We can all ...
These are three necessary, but insufficient, measures.
They were not among the hooligans!
I would like to make three points.
Firstly, on making poverty history.
We need to work on infrastructure and on access.
What should we do in the short term?
Three things.
âMake poverty history in 2005.
He is quite right.
We need a comprehensive Africa strategy.
There is a strong connection.
Â Â  .
I congratulate his mother on her 100th birthday.
That is why we need more of it.
That is the first point.
It is how we did it here in Europe.
Â Â  Minister, your time is not restricted.
You may speak for as long as you wish.
Â Â  .
If not now, then when?â
Now is the time to act.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Benn.
I do not think it right or proper.
Â Â  Thank you for assisting the Presidency, Mr Schulz.
Â Â  Mr President, I am privileged.
I understand Spanish without the headphones.
Â Â  You are extremely unruly today.
Â Â  .
Not at all.
We know that.
All the same, it is an interesting prerequisite.
It is an important cultural factor.
We are the ones who must do so.
We have no more excuses.
Â Â  You may not speak, pursuant to RuleÂ 90.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
However, this convergence has a common significance.
Â Â  .
There will be no harmonisation at EU level.
Many options have already been explored formally and informally.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I hope the House will consent to that.
The entire amendment now reads as follows:
That is one suggestion.
This is an addition: a further recital.
There had to be one winner.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that this is self-evident.
That brings the voting to a close.
Â Â  .
I call on the Council to oppose this proposal.
Third, the wrong choice of European Parliament rapporteur.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â Europe needs clear rules.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is also my opinion.
This can be no mere coincidence.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â· it rejects any renationalistion of regional policy spending;
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The law of asymmetrical development is inexorable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .

Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We shall vote in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of this report.
This mainly requires reform of agricultural policy.
The EU must also change.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Many elements militate against the success of this approach.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I fully support this Joint motion.
Words are not enough; we need action.
This will require enormous resources.
Â Â  We wholeheartedly support the fight against global poverty.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Many of them were killed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
As for independence, that is clearly one option.
Its outcome is not a foregone conclusion.
Â Â  Thank you, Minister.
Â Â  .
Justice is an essential element of reconciliation.
This is unacceptable.
Their place is in The Hague.
This is what the European Union is all about.
This was very wise.
For years, we left the Bosniaks alone.
That was also the reality of the time.
Today, the European Union provides political stability.
No one doubts the efforts of the European Union.
I wish the British Presidency good luck.
All the recordings have been found.
The Balkans are in Europe.
So is Srebrenica.
Let us never forget that lesson.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
He has not yet been rehabilitated.
These are all fundamental questions of status.
We lived those images.
I refer to Srebrenica.
Ten years later, Bosnia is still deeply divided.
Europe made a great many mistakes in the 1990s.
It must not repeat them.
Â Â  .
Mrs Pack spoke powerfully on the need for reconciliation.
Mr Posselt raised the issue of Croatia.
I pay tribute to his work today.
None of this will be easy.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
All these discussions bring benefits to both parties.
But much more is needed.
The situation in Tibet and Xinjiang remain a concern.
Now Taiwan is a full democracy.
It is one of our key objectives.
Nevertheless, concerns remain.
It is a requirement of economic growth and development.
Â Â  .
We have to know that and prepare for it.
I would like to tackle that question now.
Rising tensions are not a given, however.
There is a political dialogue.
The general idea is fully reciprocal two-way relations.
I will stop here.
Â Â  .
It is exactly what it says: a compromise.
I would like to make three main points.
Â Â  .
Taiwan already participates in numerous areas of international cooperation.
Â Â  .
Time has not stood still in Taiwan either.
The German Chancellor has echoed his comments.
Is that really so?
Is not this hypocrisy?
None whatsoever.
Â Â  .
No date was set for a decision.
The last round was held in Luxembourg in February.
Let me say a word or two in conclusion.
This is all to the good.
Â Â  .
I thank all Members for their interesting contributions.
They have concentrated on a few topics.
That is simply not true.
I would also like to mention Taiwan.
We stand before a reform of the United Nations.
China will have a very important say there.
If needed, we are always standing ready.
I thank you for this highly satisfactory discussion.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 7Â JulyÂ 2005.
Â Â  .
Anti-personnel landmines are merciless and indiscriminate.
This is no mistake.
The Convention is a success story.
We will continue to do so.
There is still much to be done.
This is why humanitarian de-mining is particularly important.
Â Â  .
Its overarching objective is a zero-victim target.
This is not a remote political dream.
It is an achievable goal.
Â Â  .
It is very nice to see him here.
More than 60 civilians died.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 7Â JulyÂ 2005.

Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Does the Council agree?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I welcome the Minister to the House.
I hope he is enjoying the experience.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I would, however, add this additional remark.
Â Â  .
The President-in-Office is extremely clear.
We have taken a lead on this.
Many Member States have yet to implement anti-discrimination legislation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Perhaps that is simply something on which we disagree.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much for that answer.
However, putting that to one side.

) whose footprint extends to most of Europe.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Very good.
Has it already been?
These are specific questions.
Â Â  .
I would simply make a couple of points.
MrsÂ Ries is absolutely right in this respect.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That seems to me to be common sense.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much, President-in-Office.
I am very grateful for that.
What an impressive start you are making.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Tackling the problem needs a global approach.
Â Â  .
The people are not talking about the Constitutional Treaty.
We are talking about the Constitutional Treaty.
They are talking about the developing world.
Please continue to drive that agenda.
You have given great leadership on this issue.
Please do not drop the ball.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Minister, for that reply.
Â Â  .
Member States are also responsible for monitoring these procedures.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That ends Question Time.
Â Â  .
Obviously there might be an ongoing dispute.
We feel very strongly about that.
Our opinions differ as regards the legal basis.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Who knows anything about the EIB?
It should lend to infrastructure and to SMEs.
It should lend microcredits.
It should lend beyond the EDF.
What is EUR 20 million in our development budget?
That is all we are talking about.
I think it is high time we did this.
2005 is the year of micro-credit.
I would also like to emphasise one final point.
We appreciate the progress that the EIB has made.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This is in order to keep him alive.
He is a priest living in Acre in Brazil.
But we need to move fast.
Globally, 10 million hectares are lost every day.
In 1998 the G8 agreed that action was needed.
But it is not yet being implemented.
Illegal trade is a key factor in bad governance.
I am glad that the Commission is taking action.
You are a relatively new Commissioner.
You have inherited this dossier from your predecessors.
Â Â  .
Voluntary partnership agreements are a good place to start.
Secondly, we can make use of consumer power.
They are not being altruistic.
This practice must be stopped.
The effects are not only social but also environmental.
Urgent action must be taken.
We have no say over the matter.
It is stuck in Council.
That logjam needs to be unblocked.
Let us have these NGOs putting pressure on them.
And where were the Commissionâs resources?
That is pretty minimal.
Please wave the flags, say you need more.
Can you still stand by that statement?
We have already debated this problem at length.
I will attempt to relaunch this discussion.
In other sectors triangular trade does exist.
I assume that you are familiar with the problem.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It is even clearer now.
Here I fully support the initiatives of the Commission.
I fully appreciate Commission efforts in this respect.
Â Â  .
She has been active in finding compromises.
My Group was not very happy with her approach.
Nevertheless, I wish to repeat some concerns.
Â Â  .
We need to make considerable progress.
What needs to be done to achieve this progress?
Firstly, I want to address market participants.
These are the three main segments.
Why do we need to hurry?
The countries of Asia are still forming their markets.
I do not mind admitting that I rather do.
First of all, free competition.
We think it is balanced and open.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Why are we having this debate?
The political decision has been taken.
Â Â  .
Eighteen months is indeed a long time.
Parliament must play a key role in this process.
The accession process must not be allowed to stall.
These are the really crucial issues.
Their accession is guaranteed.
The question, perhaps, is when exactly?
I strongly reassured them.
That is the precedent we should follow.
It is a privilege I firmly intend to preserve.
Let us remember the difficult history of these countries.
How should we honour their memory?
We have given our word.
Consolidation will mean more Europe.
A headlong rush will mean a dispersed Europe.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This approach implies even greater subsidiarity than at present.
We believe that this really is a poor assessment.
The damage, we know, is global.
There is therefore a significant shortcoming.
Â Â  .
How has it been enriched?
Why?
Yet we also require specific tools.
MrsÂ Lienemann has just reminded us of this.
We suggest how LIFE + could be significantly strengthened.
That is something we cannot accept.
However, we know how local elected representatives behave.
That cannot be true.
What will we do in those cases?
We need you.
That really would be regrettable.
It is worth it.
Do we want to preserve our natural heritage?
This is a growing sector.
Mr Bowis has told us about the Scottish example.
He mentioned the black grouse and the Iberian lynx.
The money must be secure.
Such a state of affairs would be intolerable.
Is this an appropriate ratio?
Many thanks.
Â Â  .
LIFE + sets out to make a difference.
Clearly, therefore, this could not be accepted.
The Commission cannot accept any other amendments.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
This agreement is therefore in everyoneâs interests.
Careful monitoring will therefore continue.
I now come to the Euro-Mediterranean zone.
Â Â  .
I should like to add a few additional points.
Hence the proposals for amendments that we tabled.
Â Â  .
There is good and bad in this.
Are there perhaps other variations?
Will they get their goods?
This is not about protectionism.
It is essential that this take place.
Â Â  .
Much of that has changed over the years.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
Â Â  .
But that alone is not enough.
The idea is absurd.
Â Â  .
These events are ongoing.
I have been informed about them.
I have requested information.
Little wonder that we cannot compete.
That loophole must be closed.
Compliance with the existing rules must be ensured.
They are entitled to predictability and legal certainty.
My compliments to Mrs SaÃ¯fi.
That sums up its capacity.
Let me now pass on to the social aspect.
We all stand with you today.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Commission should have chosen the assent procedure instead.
Â Â  .
I propose that the first part be adopted.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â That concludes voting time.
I suggest postponing the vote to the next part-session.
I strongly support the motion.
I genuinely regret that.
I do not believe that it is.
Â Â  .
Primary responsibility for it lies with the Member States.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted for this report.
Â Â  .
We protect the environment because we put people first.
That should be the principle guiding what we do.
Â Â  .
Our protest is directed solely at the procedure.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is a demographic power.
We already know that our defences are weakening substantially.
Our problem is therefore one of semantics.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That systematically results in a social and environmental disaster.
In short, trade unions are hugely repressed.
They are therefore entirely and jointly responsible.
We are only seeing the first stage.
What can we do?
A common European market requires common rules.
That is part of what respect for competition means.
China represents the ideology of state enterprises.
The Commission would immediately pronounce a ban.
It is also acting positively.
The Commission largely shares this point of view.
These include antidumping duties or anti-subsidy measures.
The matter was discussed.
Fraudsters are often clever at exploiting such situations.
It affects only those Member States that are unprepared.
I should like to make a few more comments.
It is not true that it would do so.
MrsÂ Laperrouze welcomes the agreement, rightly I believe.
An Airbus represents 20 million Chinese shirts.
That is something worth repeating.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in September.
This is not an efficient administrative framework.
This is an approach considered reasonable by the Commission.
The second aspect concerns exemption from customs duties.
The third aspect is that of exports.
The proposal constitutes a package.
This needs to be pointed out.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Accordingly, the system must be changed.
I therefore support the report.
Â Â  .
Why have we not tightened and enforced sanctions?
Â Â  .
The situation there is desperate and deteriorating.
I will now turn to Zimbabwe.
What are the reactions on the international stage?
How does such arrogance come about?
What is that slow slide from democracy to dictatorship?
We agree about that.
They definitely must be applied.
Obviously, I agree.
That is the first thing I wanted to say.
That needs to be acknowledged.
Otherwise, you will not be fully informed.
Someone tell me what has to be done.
Do troops need to be sent in?
What should be done?
I personally am ready to engage in that debate.
I am not indifferent to such a debate.
We are not just a sounding board.
There is no end of condemnation going on.
That is what I believe.
That is something you should know.
I vigorously condemn Mugabeâs attitude.
There is no reason for not applying them.
That goes without saying.
This is disgraceful.
There is a procedural problem in this House.
They do not share your view, Commissioner.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Trafficking of women and children is commonplace.
âNo protection, no justiceâ.
Many had been raped.
Fewer than one in ten murders have been investigated.
This problem is one of enormous complexity.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Â Â  .
Thirty-six people were killed in these disturbances.
Â Â  .
The risk of civil war is not mere rhetoric.
We must step up our efforts, however.
We should take this as our guiding principle.
Â Â  .
Tomorrow will be for questions and for reasons.
Today is for decency and humanity.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I envy Ethiopia.
I intervened personally.
Mr Solana intervened.
There too, we have obtained satisfaction.
We shall continue to support the process.
This process is obviously a delicate one.
We shall see what comes of the matter.
It was important that I informed you of this.
Of course, the situation is a delicate one.
Naturally, it is risky.
Of course, it is dangerous.
Who would imagine otherwise?
That is certainly the case where Ethiopia is concerned.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
Everyone knows that this seat is threatened.
Â Â  The vote is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
No amendments have been proposed for Monday or Tuesday.
Mrs Frassoni would like to do so.
We are thus facing a real emergency situation.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Poettering.
In fact, the situation has worsened.
I request your kind support in this matter.
Edinburgh and Scotland hosted the G8 Summit this year.
The Edinburgh bid was better and cheaper.
It is incomprehensible.
They believe they lost it on unfair terms.
Â Â  Mr President,
Thus far, they have refused.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  .
Floods and forest fires occur repeatedly in Europe.
The Commission has certain such resources at its disposal.
Let me give you some examples.
Â Â  .
Commissioner, twenty-four hours is sometimes too long.
The first has to do with protection against flooding.
Were these measures effective this year?
Climate change is happening now.
This is my message.
These disasters are mistakenly described as natural disasters.
Commissioner, you have made proposals along these lines.
We will support it in this area.
Funds for this purpose are still available for 2005.
The flames travelled 20Â km in three hours.
It is horrendous.
Our forest is one of our greatest national treasures.
We too are with them.
However, I would like to make one point.
I do not think this needs any further explanation.
In such cases immediate rescue operations are required.
Disasters know no borders.
The European Union needs firstly to strengthen cross-border cooperation.
Very often, the Member States use incompatible equipment.
A well-coordinated response is always more effective.
The Netherlands offered two helicopters, Slovakia one.
Many people have been arrested.
We received the request yesterday morning.
That has worked very well up until now.
Of course, there is still room for improvement.
Â Â  â The debate on this item is closed.
Other important proposals have, however, been rejected.
That also applies to inert waste.
Instead, proper waste-processing facilities should be built.
It will bring about speedier improvement in the industry.
It will favour environmental technology and research.
Let us take advantage of these opportunities.
Â Â  .
We cannot apply one single measure to everything.
This would avoid unnecessary costs associated with landfill.
This is intended to achieve that end.
I rather prefer the Commission's more ambitious proposals.
Well, let us see how the votes go.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It brings in bauxite to make alumina.
We need very strong â¦
That is why I welcome this report.
I support this part of the joint position.
We also have an acceptable compromise report before us.
We should not be so dictatorial with our directives.
I have personal experience of this.
Â Â  .
Amendment 27 expressly refers to protected areas.
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Agendas and minutes should be published.
This is a critical period in Europe's history.
Belief is an integral part of the human condition.
Procedures alone are not enough.
I am afraid that your explanation is not satisfactory.
Are sects accepted from now on?
What subjects are debated?
I call for complete transparency in this matter.
Allow me to return to the World Youth Days.
On that issue, I cannot believe my eyes.
That beats the wedding feast at Cana.
Yet who are they trying to kid?
One hundred years ago!
Â Â  .
That is an initial practical remark.
There is therefore a desire for balance.
Â Â  .
I support what has just been said.
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
Â Â  .
Every one of them affected European passengers.
Community measures are vital.
Ramp inspections must be more comprehensive and better targeted.
Â Â  .
That is unacceptable.
Right now, what can we do?
They are among the fundamental requirements.
It was a sickening sight.
You cannot begin to imagine what we saw.
What controls you carry out?
Do you not know all that?
Who will fly there in winter?
What planes will fly there?
We want answers here.
We want safe flights at long last.
You said that you sent experts.
Did you send a flight safety expert?
No one visited the scene of the accident.
You said they went to Cyprus.
So who are the specialists?
Let us tell the truth in here.
That is a crime against the people.
The rapporteur has explained it.
I already have one for it.
The agency is only three years old.
What we need are rules, controls and investment.
Â Â  Events have overwhelmed legislators.
This is unacceptable.
I would insist on four requirements.
There are, however, certain important question marks.
Commissioner, people are more important than profits.
Â Â  .
MrÂ Sterckx also talked about third countries.
Why have we taken so long?
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
The development phase of the programme is running smoothly.
Firstly, the programme has now reached maturity.
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
Parliament explicitly welcomes the PPP form of implementation.
Their opinions are an integral part of the report.
Â Â  .
In the early years, we had reservations.
I wish the project every success.
Nonetheless, allow me a word of criticism.
I hope we will make it this time.
I will look more respectable tomorrow.
That is something we cannot change.
The various debates this evening are revealing.
The Galileo project is one such area.
The individual countries cannot manage this task successfully.
Europe can no longer be the first one.
It is a comprehensive and high-quality report.
I give my approval.
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
It is vital for:
The autonomy of nations is strengthened.
This cooperation also includes countries outside the EU.
The traditions are different; the culture is different.
I therefore ask you to support these compromises.
That goes against the grain with me.
A great deal has been written about this topic.
How do we intend to tackle natural radiation?
Â Â  .
This is absolute nonsense.
We are trying to do three positive things.
We are talking about a very serious risk.
That is not specific to the UK.
Â Â  .
It is absolutely ludicrous to keep it in.
What does that mean?
They are adults.
And how would you prove liability?
It would in my opinion be a legal nightmare.
Government campaigns should warn everybody.
This is an unnecessary and damaging measure.
There is a new risk.
Which way do we want Europe to go?
We are experiencing a constitutional crisis.
We are going through a financial crisis.
People no longer understand Europe.
Let me give you another brief example.
I am glad to hear the rapporteur mention subsidiarity.
In its current form, this proposal is neither.
I was not in office at the timeâ.
Better regulation?
The compromise would take us closer to them.
There must be common European rules.
None of us disagree with that.
It is impossible to operate.
We want legal certainty.
We want to leave personal responsibility to the individual.
The Commission is able to accept these amendments.
I would therefore emphasise this point.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
They are also particularly acceptable to the Commission.
Amalgamation is therefore to be welcomed.
This programme is therefore extremely important.
I also wish to emphasise the accessibility aspects.
The financial aspects have already been touched upon.
Â Â  .
I will be voting for this.
Â Â  .
Mr President, employment and social solidarity go together.
Employment is encouraged by removing restraints and scrapping regulations.
However, it goes deeper.
I should like to answer two questions.
We have also changed the percentages.
I strongly support combating all forms of discrimination.
Let that be remembered today.
Â Â  Mr President, esteemed colleagues.
Thank you.
Thank you.
PROGRESS depends on them.
I congratulate MrsÂ JÃ¶ns on her report.
Etymologists set us thinking.
The clearly identified commercial criteria are widely debated here.
Â Â  .
Mr President, that is my conclusion.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12Â noon.
Â Â  .
Today, there are 50 times that many.
Revising the directive is not easy.
We produce a great deal.
We exchange too little among Europeans.
We must remedy this shortcoming.
It is not information.
It is not advertising.
Yet is it reality TV, for example?
I could also emphasise the role of public services.
They must be able to carry out their remit.
How can we help them to do this?
Â Â  .
Let us stop doing so.
The so-called quotas generally worked well.
For me, that is a crucial point.
The other question concerns the case of non-domestic productions.
Often our legislation just follows technical developments.
Â Â  .
However, we also have some experience.
Finally, we must ensure pluralism of the media.
This way we will achieve the best result.
Television is without frontiers.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at noon.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote
- Joseph Daul report (A6-0233/2005)
The present system costs a lot of money.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The British Conservatives today abstained on this report.
Â Â  .
The present system costs a lot of money.
- Joseph Daul report (A6-0234/2005)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
- Etelka Barsi-Pataky report (A6-0212/2005)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
- Paolo Costa report (A6-0232/2005)
Â Â  .
- Paolo Costa report (A6-0231/2005)
Â Â  .
- Paulo Casaca report (A6-0238/2005)
Â Â  .
Â Â  We have chosen to vote against this report.
Individual Member States should decide on the funding.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I fully endorse this report.
This initiative must be supported.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
- Ewa Klamt report (A6-0214/2005)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
- Michael Gahler report (A6-0239/2005)
Â Â  .
- Jonas SjÃ¶stedt report (A6-0236/2005)
Â Â  .
I have noted the importance of in voting to-day.
Â Â  .
We have therefore voted against Amendment 8.
Â Â  .
- Karin JÃ¶ns report (A6-0199/2005)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
- Tokia SaÃ¯fi report (A6-0193/2005)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We need appropriate counter-measures.
Â Â  We Moderates voted today against the above-noted report.
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Chinese workers work six long days a week.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
- Henri Weber report (A6-0202/2005)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This was a very promising beginning to our relationship.
This is a point which is worth repeating.
The draft budget seeks to make that distinction.
I know that Parliament shares these concerns.
How is it possible to do all this?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
However, there is also another problem.
Â Â  .
This is a strategic objective that we cannot accept.
It already amounts to more than EURÂ 8Â billion.
We cannot foresee the future.
That is unacceptable.
âMake poverty historyâ.
We cannot do a thing.
Europe is getting poor.
There is no development.
We cannot get Europe out of poverty.
It is ruining us.
Europe is getting poor.
Are we only going to pay money for computers?
This is the wrong policy.
Think about the people.
We cannot accept it.
The Council has inexplicably proposed reducing from 29 to â¦
The cuts are unsurprising, as usual.
There will always be cuts in agriculture.
Why not wait for that?
But why?
No chance!
Now that really is what I call confidence-building!
In my opinion, it makes little sense.
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
In Indonesia some EUR 8 billion has been committed.
I have just returned from Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
Nothing much has changed.
We adopted that opinion yesterday in my committee.
It is a tragedy and a scandal.
I find this highly regrettable.
Â Â  .
But what a mockery!
Yes, the European Union really is sick.
Â Â  .
Now the issue is one of reconstruction assistance.
Reconstruction is a huge project.
Our arguments have not succeeded.
On the contrary.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
It was a comprehensive reply.
Â Â  .
That completes the first part of my answer.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I thank Commissioner Reding for her comprehensive reply.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It was a truly surprising interview.
What will you change today, Commissioner?
Â Â  .
I thank you for your kind words.
Â Â  .
There were a lot of perceptions and hopes.
Â Â  .
Good communication is essential for a healthy democracy.
Â Â  Thank you for your good and thorough answer.
Â Â  .
The institutions are blaming each other.
You cannot have prosperity without peace and stability.
Â Â  .
I can only say that I agree.
Leadership is definitely needed as well.
I could not agree more.
Â Â  .
I thank you for your support.
Above all else, who is paying for it?
Â Â  .
Different arguments are going on in other countries.
Â Â  .
We have to have state-of-the-art technology.
It should not spread political propaganda.
It is about transparency and accountability.
My answer is no.
We must remember what has happened.
People today demand more of our democratic systems.
Providing information should be one of our fundamental tasks.
The next question is
What are the results of that elucidation?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Is it the American authorities?
The airline companies?
European authorities?
I do not think that your reply is satisfactory.
I believe that is still a valid question.
Does the Commission already have any ideas about this?
That was months ago.
Can I just ask a supplementary question?
What is the position on this issue?
In which areas?
Â Â  .
It called for the submission of a Commission proposal.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
Â Â  .
It would be worth relaunching this idea.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We will work in this direction.
That concludes Question Time.
Our work is essential.
I know Parliament is capable of that.
Today, self-regulation is no longer enough.
First of all, politicians have a responsibility.
Next, the industry has a responsibility.
Those, in essence, are our proposals.
It is the least we can do for them.
Â Â  .
Yet we must ask ourselves if this enough.
Parents should also be involved.
Filter systems must become more widespread.
Â Â  .
This recommendation has precisely that objective.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
The Internet is regulated in a different way.
There are a number of answers to that.
We will support it in our policies.
That is what is essential here.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12Â noon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  . Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12Â noon.
Ten new member states give harmonisation additional impetus.
Why do we need harmonised VAT rates?
To help the single market?
She has made a truly outstanding job of it.
It is, however, a reality.
I definitely say six months, not five months.
Why should Europe not do the same?
However, this system imposes too many restrictions.
Why?
There is no Europe-wide price for medicinal products.
Let us make no mistake.
What is Europe good for?
Your vote will be decisive.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is who we are talking about today.
The key is how we provide incentives to research.
We want to catch up with that.
We need to ensure that it is correctly worded.
We welcome the MICE.
I have also spoken to parents with sick children.
They could not understand it.
It is their money we are carving up.
Your plea has therefore not been an entire waste.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we welcome this regulation.
These medicinal products must have a therapeutic benefit.
Our ultimate aim is aÂ healthy child.
Nevertheless, we must be demanding.
That is an obvious requirement of legislation.
Our children should be thriving; they are not.
What are we doing to children?
I have just one more question for the Commissioner.
It should not be tolerated by Parliament.
We should not consent to this.
These two things cannot be weighed against each other.
Why is that?
Three problem areas can be identified.
That is a very simple and fundamental principle.
The price of medicines need not become unnecessarily expensive.
That is not a good thing.
I would support the first option.
Further increases would be unacceptable for me.
There is no way of getting around this.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12Â noon.
Â Â  .
In so doing I suggest three principal approaches.
Often that picture is pieced together after the fact.
These are all important and difficult measures.
They all require hard-headed discussions and practical agreement.
Those rights are actively threatened by criminals and terrorists.
I believe that our proposals offer that.
Such values will and must have political expression.
The second line of action is protection.
Understanding is needed, but so is determination.
Time is pressing upon us.
There is no other way.
Â Â  .
They have the right to a fair trial.
There should be no exception for third-country nationals.
Â Â  .
I think that is an extremely worrying factor.
I will return to that in a moment.
I want to say a few words about that.
The end does not justify the means.
Â Â  .
It will not.
Â Â  .
Of course we must have cooperation.
With all of those rights comes a responsibility.
We enter into a social contract with our governments.
President-in-Office, you mentioned the issue of data retention.
Thank you for coming, President-in-Office.
We will support you.
However, it does not depend only on this.
Yes, terrorism is of an intellectual nature.
Indeed, allow me a slight digression.
This really has to stop.
The phenomenon can be seen not only in Iraq.
I fully agree with that view and that statement.
So where can we find the European political project?
We simply do not understand it.
They only see national police forces.
It is not possible to fight against terrorism.
To say we are fighting international terrorism means nothing.
That goes without saying.
How can we respond to their legitimate concerns?
We must not choose the wrong target.
In what language, though, does terrorism speak?
Â Â  Mr President, terrorism is nothing new.
You may well ask why.
I would be obliged if you could do so.
The test is that the measures should be necessary.
They must also be proportionate.
We do not need grand statements.
I should like to raise three specific issues.
No-fly lists are another concern.
Who has access to these lists?
Not all suspects are identified.
The costs are .
They are not worth the money.
The terrorist threat affects us all.
This is true of almost all the Member States.
I would urge him to make such an effort.
MrÂ Clarke referred to the case of London.
Intercommunity relations will be devastated.
I hear much talk of the targeting of mosques.
I am a European Muslim.
I would make two points in this respect.
Some countries ban organisations, others do not.
Surely that cannot be the Europe of 2005?
My final point concerns the transfer of data.
Let us lay our cards on the table here.
âReactionâ is the word MrÂ Frattini used.
That is not an abstract or philosophical question.
Every measure must always be carefully weighed up.
It means more than police cooperation and solidarity.
I trust your antennae are sensitive to this tendency.
No wonder London is widely dubbed 'Londonistan'.
Mr President-in-Office, you have a lot to do.
Balance is essential.
They are indeed, but why?
Why are we not doing that?
Both are necessary and both are equally valuable.
Â Â  .
I agree entirely.
That is what should happen!
I will just add one other point.
I cannot â they are here.
That is an obligation we have in addressing them.
I accept those criticisms.
They were well made.
How should we act now?
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
I ask that the Minutes be amended accordingly.
It has now gone 12.30 p.m.
The Presidency must do something.
Â Â  That point is noted.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
( : see Minutes)
Â Â  It fell because Amendments 23 and 31 were adopted.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the Garriga-Polledo report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
To radiation, national borders present no obstacles.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That treaty has been rejected.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is not very convincing.
If there is demand, there is also supply.
Â Â  .
The intention of this proposed regulation is laudable.
Â Â  .
I warmly welcome this proposal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the GrossetÃªte report.
Â Â  .
These new rules are long overdue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The aim of simplifying VAT is an admirable one.
Â Â  .
That goes without saying.
Â Â  .
In short, they managed a difficult task well.
The international community has pledged its full support.
No law can be passed that contradicts those tenets.
Freedom of belief is protected in the constitution.
All extremist groups are prohibited.
We remain committed to a diplomatic solution.
Â Â  .
The professionalism of both sides is to be commended.
But real challenges lie ahead.
The Commission is helping in this.
Â Â  .
The European Union is the main donor to Palestine.
Â Â  .
It is also a global problem.
This is an issue that the UN must tackle.
We have a big responsibility in this area.
Â Â  .
That is a recipe for disaster.
The withdrawal from Gaza has been difficult.
Yet the glass is sadly also half-empty.
How should this be approached?
The unilateral pull-out from Gaza has justifiably raised expectations.
The settlers have left Gaza.
Gaza has a border with Egypt at Rafa.
We converted 36 tonnes of yellow cake into gas.
Iran began talks with the WTO.
Those are the only tools we have.
I also welcome the EU statement on this engagement.
Egypt is the cradle of Middle Eastern politics.
The threats to our security are enormous.
Then they protested.
Today, with all the qualifications, they celebrated.
Despite all the difficulties, hope succeeded over cynicism.
Gaza cannot be economically viable otherwise.
We cannot avoid these uncomfortable truths.
The only process ahead is the political process.
Now is the time to consolidate these positive developments.
Finally, I will turn to Iran.
We see the many different signs of democratic development.
Iran must stay out of Iraqi affairs.
The people there are wretched.
There is a high rate of unemployment and poverty.
Â Â  .
This is a real opportunity for progress.
That continues to be one of our key objectives.
At least on that there was agreement between us.
Of course, that is true.
This is an achievement.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
MrÂ QueirÃ³ and MrÂ Verheugen have spoken about this.
Europe must also promote innovation through novel measures.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This needs to be addressed.
Thank you.
The project already involves twelve EU Member States.
That is how it should continue to be.
Tourism should develop on a sustainable basis.
I believe it has much to commend it.
This requires cooperation between the public and private sectors.
All of these have been emphasised here.
I believe this to be an extremely important issue.
This programme has existed in Spain for 20 years.
I am referring to the IMSERSO holidays.
A programme of this kind has five fundamental objectives.
Karl Deutsch talked about it in the 1930s.
It is as simple as that.
Secondly, it is also an area of growth.
There is real growth potential in the services sector.
All of that is good.
It is an excellent report.
People now travel at lightning speed.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  Dear Colleagues,
Good health is essential for physical and mental well-being.
There are serious challenges to be highlighted:
Many health problems affect women only or differently.
Poverty influences health.
I shall confine myself to some brief thoughts.
In lean times, that is no bad thing!
This segment therefore needs measures to encourage its development.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is by no means âQuestion Timeâ.
MrÂ RÃ¼big had a supplementary question.
Â Â  .
I am grateful for your guidance, Mr President.
Let us avoid that debate for the time being.
Mr Martin had a supplementary question.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Which is it?
Tell us the truth!
Â Â  .
Â Â  â I agree with MrÂ NewtonÂ Dunn.
Â Â  .
It goes on to elaborate on that point.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That was not a bad answer!
I can vouch for some satisfaction with that.
Â Â  .
Let me elaborate on that answer.
Â Â  .
I am grateful for this supplementary question.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That is undoubtedly true.
Â Â  Question No 4 is withdrawn
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I warmly welcome that last reply from the President-in-Office.
Â Â  .
My request to speak is therefore perfectly justified.
He may put in all two supplementary questions.â
Let us take the example of Croatia.
The question has been sent to the relevant services.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes Question Time.
This report focuses in particular on two different areas.
Â Â  .
Then there is the question of HIV/AIDS.
Â Â  .
That is our political task.
Â Â  .
This can reduce mortality by 35%.
Further data on this are urgently needed.
Â Â  .
Chlamydia leads to infertility in one third of cases.
Violence is also a symptom of mental illness.
This proves that violence is not related to gender.
This is entirely unnecessary ideology.
We do not need obscurantist attitudes!
The disease I am talking about is endometriosis.
The disease desperately needs serious research and attention.
It is a real gender issue.
That cannot be right.
It is wonderful that the rapporteur has included it.
These are specific issues that call for specific treatment.
For that matter, what has the Commission done?
We are therefore clearly dealing with two gender diseases.
Â Â  The European Parliament frequently draws attention to human rights.
We women are not a minority, however.
Health is an important part of this programme.
We women have always been carers rather than cared-for.
I hope we will meet again in daylight.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It is quite an undertaking these days.
So that does not present too many problems.
Â Â  .
The Commission will have Parliamentâs backing.
This emerges clearly from the report.
The Commission is not entirely innocent of this.
Â Â  .
The European schools system has proved its worth.
Â Â  .
Education plays a very important and fundamental role.
Â Â  .
I have no quibbles there.
There is a significant omission here.
Here is another example.
I hope she can clarify that statistic.
Could the rapporteur please clarify that as well?
Why?
Is it really necessary?
Increased demand also requires more funds to be earmarked.
I should like to thank the rapporteur.
No, they are not.
Where do they rank according to the PISA study?
Are they meeting quality targets?
The answer is ânoâ.
Are their shortcomings purely due to budgetary factors?
Again, the answer is ânoâ.
They complain of overcrowding in the European Schools.
The classes are too large.
High-achieving pupils are rarely being stretched or encouraged.
The European Schools lack an appropriate administrative culture.
Letters are going unanswered.
Â Â  .
A very interesting picture emerged.
Therefore, we have a controversial situation.
What about multilingualism?
That is the main issue.
I investigated this issue a little in Brussels.
Parents were asked to provide some additional financing.
That is the information available to me.
How are decisions made, how are strategies defined?
Of course, financial matters are also very serious.
They found clear discrimination.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The ninth is the Russian Federation.
Â Â  .
It is our sea: .
Â Â  .
Canada, too, is involved in many projects.
Â Â  .
It wants European Union involvement.
We should respond to that.
Â Â  .
The greatest cause of this is agriculture.
Â Â  .
The Baltic is an absolutely unique inland sea.
Â Â  .
Why?
All this should be taken into account.
There is a rather substantial difference.
It has two options.
I would like to make three observations.
I firmly believe that it needs it.
So give it its own budget line.
So let us get more focus.
They need to work together.
I want to ask the Commissioner one final question.
It was good to hear that the Commissioner agrees.
Important infrastructure projects can bind the region together.
Energy supplies must become more diverse.
I should like to make three observations.
I shall now say something about specific funding.
That option obviously has its merits.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
I shall return to this point.
Health risks constitute absolutely the wrong type of advertising.
Let us not deceive ourselves.
I shall give just two examples.
We ourselves must strengthen our own structures.
We need help in strengthening the public-private partnership.
Let us not delude ourselves.
The presence of that aid becomes apparent.
Â Â  .
The report acknowledges the transversal nature of the sector.
I entirely agree with this idea.
In other words, .
Â Â  .
Nor can we agree with paragraph 10.
Could the EU and the Commission do more?
Do we need a new DG to do that?
I am not so sure.
I very much welcome the section on sex tourism.
That is something I regard as very important.
That I regard as improper.
That is a completely absurd proposal.
Sex tourism must not be overlooked either.
Offenders must be dealt with with the utmost severity.
The sustainable tourism report was excellent.
We can be positive in this field.
I wish to raise three points.
I spoke for two minutes.
Tourism must plan well.
It must build on opportunities.
Â Â  .
It is not our job to decide for them.
That is a promise.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12Â noon.
Â Â  .
That is my theme.
In my case, I live with diabetes.
Clinical research is slow and patchy.
The story goes on.
Â Â  .
This requires additional support from the World Health Organisation.
Â Â  .
I wish to make three very brief points.
My final point is that we need more money.
We really need to do some work.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I have an oral amendment.
â That concludes voting time.
InÂ 1992, there was a regulation.
Â Â  .
We trust that they will come to fruition.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This vote has been eagerly awaited by tourism professionals.
Let us not disappoint them!
We have therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  We are voting against this report.
That is an absolutely correct assessment.
- tourist services would be classified at EU level
We are opposed to all such proposals.
Â Â  .
We welcome the adoption of our proposal, which:
Â Â  .
I agree with the broad lines of this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  .
Do as I say and not as I do!
Â Â  .
Unlike some Members I welcome this.
Â Â  .
Nonetheless, the programme has its weaknesses.
Such shortcomings must be remedied.
Â Â  .
There are many other solutions.
Â Â  .
It is a well-balanced, well-written and well-presented report.
Third, these diseases require a complex approach.
Thank you for your attention.
The example that springs to mind is leprosy.
The list of neglected diseases continues.
International commitments and undertakings are not being kept.
We bear a huge responsibility.
A responsibility towards world peace, security and stability.
Â Â  Mr President, I very much welcome this report.
One such project is being led by Oxford University.
Why?
We have not.
Not to any adequate extent.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
It is threatening stability and needs international structural intervention.
Â Â  .
Must we do the same?
Aid is finally there.
For Africa?
What about support for agricultural exports?
Two decisions must therefore be taken without delay.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is the problem.
A food crisis is complex.
We need urgent action and we need it now.
Â Â  .
This should weigh heavily on all our consciences.
Â Â  .
It was then that the humanitarian partners appeared.
That is the chronology of events.
What is the situation today?
The Commission is Nigerâs principal donor.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
I have in mind also Tibetan Buddhism and Islam.
The Roman Catholic Church has largely been driven underground.
Â Â  .
Those who offered resistance were brutally beaten up.
What are normal religious activities?
Let us call a spade a spade.
That is immaterial.
Everyone is persecuted.
Things are getting worse, not better.
There has been much talk of dialogue.
This is not just about economics.
Above all, it is about moral principles.
China deserves outright condemnation.
We simply cannot go along with this view.
Tibetan monks cannot be compelled to attend ideological training.
It will prove ineffective in China as well.
Â Â  .
Any further emphasis would be euphemistic.
The latter is not recognised by the regime.
These statistics are truly alarming.
Diplomacy will fail to produce the desired outcome.
The Union must rise to an enormous challenge.
I want them to stop the abuse of psychiatry.
Those are the abuses that we cannot tolerate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We want Syria to open up and become democratic.
These letters have remained unanswered.
We do not wish to isolate Syria.
Â Â  .
How will the Commission do this?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
They refused to sign it.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a few moments.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
The June List recommends limited EU cooperation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
No amendments have been proposed.
Mr Watson confirms that.
Could you clarify this please, Mr Schulz?
Â Â  You are therefore withdrawing your proposal.
No amendments have been proposed.
For some people, that would be sufficient.
Well, today we can say: mission accomplished.
There is broad consensus in this regard.
I am pleased about that too.
Perhaps the most important issue.
Not to have one would be a serious problem.
That possibility exists.
There is no crisis of day-to-day operation.
There is no legal vacuum.
Those problems are still there.
We have enough time.
I believe that our results are positive.
We did so.
Our position had a definite political impact.
Â Â  .
You also made reference to the Constitution.
I can assure you of that.
Â Â  .
That is unacceptable!
Â Â  .
It seeks a fresh breeze to lift its sails.
This Parliament must challenge the Member States.
Is Germany ready to reform?
Will Italy deal with its deficit?
But permit me a word on process.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, our involvement is your accountability.
Our approval is your legitimacy.
We need more champions like Airbus.
Arguably the recipe is not quite right.
For the present, it is in cold storage.
Â Â  .
Your situation is, in fact, peculiar.
What happened?
That is the least a Parliament can do.
Full stop.
Is that better regulation?
We know what its content is.
Matters are therefore very straightforward.
The Commission makes proposals and formulates ideas.
Let it come to Parliament to present its ideas.
We want a Parliament.
We want a Council that looks after its affairs.
Â Â  .
I believe you are right.
I would put forward three proposals.
One single example: war and peace.
Â Â  .
What are we doing here today?
Your people deserve better than that.
Â Â  .
Our role as legislators is to legislate.
That requires tough decisions.
For once, law comes close to morality.
We will oppose them both.
He publicly humiliated himself and France along with him.
Â Â  .
This was discussed every week at the Commission.
We continue to support the Constitution.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m.
Mrs BerÃ¨s has requested the floor.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  Mr President, today is European Day of Languages.
Lifeline ferry services are too important to be ignored.
The agreement also suggests a clear association â¦
It has an equally important political dimension.
Europe needs decisions that transcend local interests.
This obviously puts these colleagues at an unfair disadvantage.
Children spend their whole education in Portakabins.
Is that alright with Europe?
Does it tally with rural development?
Â Â  â Mr President, a man died.
Simon Wiesenthal died.
He was human and sometimes made mistakes.
A 96-year-old man passed away.
Sugar may increasingly become a strategic commodity.
The world is facing a long-term surge in demand.
I urge you to help in this case.
The works were produced by Italian masters.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It conveyed strength, determination and focus.
There is no Europe without solidarity.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, the Solidarity movement had three meanings.
Their message is one of European unity.
Thank you, Europe!
Brotherhood underpins European unity.
This vision remains relevant today.
It was a movement inspired by values.
Â Â  .
For me, the visit was a real eye-opener.
Â Â  .
I experienced this myself.
Freedom without solidarity amounts to self-will.
It breaks up families and societies.
Ultimately, they are endangering freedom itself.
Solidarity was instrumental in much more besides.
Our freedom is not all it could be.
We are all indebted to Solidarity.
Unemployment exceeds 15%.
The standard of living is plummeting.
All social achievements have been eroded.
Foreign capital is plundering the country.
The leaders deceived the workers.
That is what they think about the European Union.
It is not easy to show solidarity.
That is why an effort of solidarity is needed.
That enabled ordinary decent people to reinstate respectable values.
It needs to be grafted onto all Europeans.
And so it came to pass.
Europe is more than an economy and a market.
I am confident that this can be achieved.
Poland is a symbol for Europe.
The debate is closed.
They died because they demanded bread and freedom.
Â Â  , .
Let me now turn to the comitology issue.
This is an important step forward.
Let me make only a few more specific points.
I look forward to hearing your comments.
Â Â  .
Basel is an international agreement.
We must, though, weigh up their merits.
Comitology is a weak point and will remain one.
It is down to the Council.
Â Â  .
I will enlarge on this point later on.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to our Chamber.
First level: general principles, basic guidelines.
Second level: concrete legal rules.
Level one, codecision.
Level two, complete exclusion of Parliament.
That is the danger we are worried about.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There are no objective answers to those vexed questions.
The banking industry does not need that.
Banks spend their time dealing with risk and uncertainty.
Â Â  .
Our constituents expect that.
I now turn to international considerations.
I will make three remarks.
That also applies to the financial market.
We are not designed for that purpose.
No selective indignation this time round, then.
I would now like to turn to the report.
We do not care how this is done.
I will conclude by making two remarks.
Otherwise, we shall become less competitive in Europe.
That is why this is an important task.
Â Â  .
It is also important for depositors.
Some speakers referred to the question of Islamic mortgages.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Statutory audit is a very important subject for Europe.
We must have proper auditors in the EU.
Economic confidence will grow.
So we strongly support the outcome.
The Commission shares the concerns expressed by the Council.
The Commission can agree with this.
Â Â  .
That is what matters most of all.
Â Â  .
Amendments have been accepted in the field of independence.
I would like once again to congratulate Mr Doorn.
Â Â  .
It also has a role in transposition and implementation.
Â Â  .
The question was also raised about audit committees.
I thank the Members for their detailed contributions.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Let me now turn to the amendments.
Amendment 6 cannot be accepted by the Commission.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It was a very profitable arrangement, after all.
I have a few questions.
It does not reach the debate here at home.
This Parliament has demanded change on many occasions.
I entirely agree with the rapporteur on this issue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Then there are reasons regarding future prospects.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We therefore ask for separate voting on several amendments.
Â Â  .
What do we want?
We must rectify the flaws in the asylum policy.
We must protect the refugees.
Â Â  .
My group has demonstrated its willingness to do this.
Â Â  .
My political group has a major problem with this.
That is all very generous.
We also welcome the commitment to adequate interpretation.
Which are these safe countries?
Â Â  .
I fear that Lampedusa is no exception.
I would like to make two important points.
Alas, poor us!
I therefore understood nothing of what the speaker said.
Â Â  I am sorry to hear this.
That is inherently contradictory.
We have brought our light to the planet.
To what kind of pass has Europe come?
Why, though, should it be?
That is the state we are in.
The only democratic proposal is to withdraw the directive.
Billions of people live under the threat of persecution.
I understand this need well.
We should not automatically presume.
Particular care should be taken when children are involved.
They tend to be psychological and humanitarian.
Unfortunately, progress has been very slow.
Next, I wish to make three detailed observations.
My second observation concerns the list of safe countries.
Obviously, this cannot be allowed to happen.
The system must also respect human rights.
I have taken good note of their comments.
It is a matter of credibility.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12Â noon.
Â Â  .
This is only a first phase agreement.
I wish to highlight two other very important points.
This is not at all the case.
This is not mutual recognition.
Â Â  .
We have no need of synthetic wine!
Commissioner Fischer Boel also mentioned another organisation.
The USA has left the OIV.
Â Â  .
We can take pride in our European wine.
It is esteemed and enjoyed the world over.
Â Â  .
Today, the situation is extremely confused.
Only the Members may do that.
They also emphasise the protection of geographical designations.
There is an economic necessity underpinning all of this.
Long live European wine!
All the best, Commissioner!
What will happen to them?
Â Â  .
That is an important point.
That link has to be taken into consideration.
However, various myths seem to abound.
That goes without saying.
He can be quite sure about that.
The debate is therefore closed.
Â Â  .
I ask you to endorse it.
Â Â  Thank you for that clarification.
Moreover, I will resume voting time without delay.
Here is the said bottle of champagne.
Â Â  .
We have therefore voted against this report.
Fisheries policy does not need to be aid policy.
Â Â  .
The June List does not share that view.
That is why we have voted against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  , .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I shall therefore vote against the proposals.
Â Â  .
Is Afghanistan safe after the war?
Some people in Belgium believe they are.
Â Â  â The sitting is resumed.
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  .
What is the future for Europe?
For our Europe.
Â Â  .
They wish to do these things themselves.
We also have variety in Europe.
Take the transport area, for example.
Â Â  .
All of this results in problems with daily commuting.
Can we overcome these problems without too much difficulty?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What is territorial cohesion?
How typical of this mad European Union.
He should visit the so-called region that I represent.
This also applies to rural and remote areas.
It is about long-term thinking and strategic action.
The urban aspect is worthy of mention.
Other important factors are entrepreneurship and the knowledge-based economy.
We need more than lip service to the idea.
The new countries lag far behind.
It aims for territorial integration.
The services which the European Commission insists on liberalising?
But we shall leave that to one side.
The regions are artificial.
They are spurious.
They have no identity.
We English are very tolerant.
We do it with resignation.
So carry on with your policy.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Kilroy-Silk.
The speaking time allotted to you is nothing personal.
It is not my will, nor my responsibility.
Let me remind you of some obvious examples.
Conditions in the enlarged European Union are different.
I urge the Commission to clarify its position.
Lifeline ferry services are too important to be ignored.
The European Union is the country of solidarity.
We need to give them solace. .
The region is the foundation of Europe.
Nonetheless, it remains a dream.
All aspects of territorial cooperation should be strengthened.
In short, specialisation within the regions is necessary.
I come from the Mazowsze region.
That is a very welcome approach from both rapporteurs.
My second remark concerns the territorial indicators.
I welcome the rapporteurs' proposals on that point.
My fourth remark concerns the agencies.
All in all, I support them.
What can the EU do about this?
Â Â  .
I am very pleased that we share many ideas.
I agree that this question deserves further examination.
That was done in Luxembourg in May.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  .
That is something on which the institutions agree.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
I now give the floor to Mr Stubb.
It is a very good initiative.
We need more freedom.
I have two suggestions to make.
Â Â  .
The Commission has agreed to this.
Nevertheless I welcome what the Commission is saying.
We will therefore be very vigilant.
Better law-making does not have to mean fewer laws.
What place is given to standardisation?
The European Parliament draws its legitimacy from codecision.
We must not reduce its legislative power.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
What geographical region do these measures emphasise?
What is the role of vaccination?
The same applies to legislation.
Â Â  I did not say that vaccination was not useful.
Â Â  It is an interesting case.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you for your suggestion.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Then there is the problem of third countries.
It must be transposed before AprilÂ 2006.
Â Â  .
One had heart arteries which were 90% blocked.
Forget competition.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I believe that answers Mr Papadimoulis' basic question.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is all I can say at the moment.
The question is straightforward.
Â Â  .
Does such a document exist?
Â Â  .
Have you investigated why Greece is behind?
What is the reason?
Have you any information on the matter?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Have you received them?
Â Â  .
If so, which ones?
Â Â  Â There has been mention of the budget for 2007-13.
For ObjectiveÂ III the cuts amounted to 50%.
Thank you for your response, CommissionerÂ HÃ¼bner.
It was competent, detailed and to the point.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you for that information.
I have visited many science and business parks.
Do you agree with that prediction?
Â Â  .
That is absolutely clear.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for your very precise answer.
Â Â  .
I do not agree with the honourable Member.
The contractor has given various assurances.
We will then reach our final decisions thereafter.
This is a fact-finding exercise.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your comprehensive answer.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Â Â  .
Perhaps the matter could be further pursued then.
That would be one way of proceeding.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This does nothing to redress the issue.
Â Â  .
That is the allegation that has been made.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
They were invented at the Tepl monastery.
Our European culture would be poorer as a result.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
In my opinion, this is accurate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I have a question for you, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Is the Commission aware of this?
Â Â  .
How much longer can the Commission tolerate this?
Â Â  .
That is the reason.
Â Â  .
I have always been in favour of transparency.
That would cause huge problems.
Â Â  .
Two ideas were put forward.
They do not contribute to the modulation.
Â Â  Yes, we did.
I had hoped that you had heard me.
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
and
MrÂ Savary is the rapporteur.
That is the first proposal for a directive.
MrÂ Jarzembowski is the rapporteur.
The report concerned is by MrÂ Sterckx.
MrÂ ZÄ«le is the rapporteur for this fourth proposal.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Barrot.
That is our goal.
Those are our objectives.
This is why we need the third railway package.
I do not know whom he meant.
No doubt he knows this man.
In any case I do not.
Why is it exemplary?
Firstly, we have extended it.
We also wanted to clarify the text.
Â Â  .
I believe that annual quality reports are unnecessary.
I urge you not to take it apart.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is our first reading.
We shall all meet again then.
Â Â  .
The national networks should be opened up.
Moreover, schedules are not passenger-friendly.
I shall give three examples.
Here, too, politicians seem to be powerless.
Access is to be guaranteed for the mobility-impaired.
No compensation mechanism is necessary for freight transport.
There must be no destructive competition.
We see this as an essential requirement.
Thank you for your attention.
This express request has never been met.
Why not?
No!
But not just any old exchange!
Dealing with everything means losing relevance.
Are we considering any restrictions?
Is that not an important consideration?
That is the way forward.
That seems to me perfectly clear.
That is where questions start to arise.
In short, there are many questions.
They all operate under very different conditions.
Perhaps a simple word association test would be useful.
And that will be achieved through modernisation and investment.
Regional rail transport has been under-financed too.
The railways are needed in Europe.
That is not the case today.
That is all well.
We must grant them equal opportunities!
The public services sector is also underdeveloped.
The third railway package now concludes our legislative efforts.
Those responsible have read the signs of the times.
It is an age-old question.
This is definitely a case for a multi-speed Europe.
It recognises the importance of this.
Â Â  .
That shows the importance we attach to this text.
Certain amendments pose a few problems.
These negotiations have focussed on commitments to quality.
That runs the risk of creating career problems.
Finally, there is the problem of periodic checks.
It is of great importance to me personally.
We are at a double turning point.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
- The Commission can accept the following amendments: and
- The Commission rejects the following amendments: and
- The Commission can accept the following amendments: and
- The Commission rejects the following amendments: and
- The Commission can accept the following amendments: and
- The Commission rejects the following amendments: and
Â Â  The sitting is closed.
Â Â  .
The strategic case for opening accession negotiations is convincing.
Both represent significant developments.
Â Â  .
This debate about Turkey is certainly very timely.
This opens a new phase in EU-Turkey relations.
This is the crux of the matter.
That is what counts.
I share many of your concerns.
Turkeyâs reform process is ongoing.
First, let us look at the brighter side.
Recently, there have been some encouraging signals.
The reforms count.
That is the best guarantee of success.
Â Â  .
Perhaps I might be permitted a few personal observations.
Â Â  .
That declaration has not been forthcoming.
That is something that worries me.
We know that torture is still going on.
Â Â  .
Let me tell you what our group wants.
This debate could do with a bit more honesty.
Â Â  Wait a moment please, Mr Schulz.
Please calm down and be quiet.
That is a day to which I look forward.
Â Â  .
This is about enlargement.
Just shut up, will you?
In that case, I mean Mr de Villiers.
Stop thinking that everything refers to you!
You are not the centre of the universe!
Europe cannot enlarge itself the way it is now.
That is a legitimate debate.
They are already included among us.
Is Islam European?
Â Â  .
I stand by that.
Â Â  .
Therefore, our vigilance is to their advantage!
Â Â  .
But, as usual, Brussels will plough on.
Good!
Much has been written on this subject.
They know very well what goes on.
When should Turkey recognise all Member States?
What about the promise that Turkey must meet conditions?
They perceive things differently.
Anything else really would be an admission of weakness.
That is courageous.
That is the first point I wanted to make.
Let there be no doubt about this.
That by way of a brief comment.
Unfortunately, last year saw retrogression and no progress.
And yet that is the case with Cyprus.
It is the Council and the Commission.
Why is this so?
That would be a great signal to move forward.
To say otherwise would be to lie.
To say otherwise would again be to lie.
The situation is even worse in the Kurdistan region.
Turkey bans him.
That is racism.
This ban is racism.
It is an insult.
What is happening is an insult to Europe.
We are making the way straight for Turkey!
You are ruining the European project!
What has happened?
Orhan Pamuk is being put on trial.
Torture is still widely practised.
In Turkey, though, things change only if ...
This is not a funeral.
We are adamant in wanting democracy of this kind.
That is a question that remains open.
It was a fine way of presenting matters.
They do not know what they are asking for.
You cannot take the culture out of a people.
We believe our culture is unique.
We are building the EU upon it.
They tried that for a thousand years.
Turkey really is changing day by day.
That is completely unacceptable.
They must have access now.
Let us be consistent.
For this key reason I oppose Turkish accession.
Those conditions have been met.
The rejectionists are in the south.
That is not justice.
The Cyprus issue must be resolved.
I welcome the opening of negotiations with Turkey.
Those negotiations will last for many years.
This will be of enormous benefit to us all.
That is one issue, and Cyprus is another.
Let us stop insulting their intelligence.
Hopefully they will not now be withdrawing their demands.
We kept none of our promises.
The people have requested some respite.
This is a two-fingered gesture to democracy.
Who are we trying to kid?
What hypocrisy!
What do the people of Turkey think about this?
And Europe for that matter?
It still has no budget for the future.
What has become of our European integration project?
Turkey has no business in joining the European Union.
Today I would like to repeat this appeal.
But fine is only what is true.
Please note that I was brief, MrÂ President.
We have had enough of giving in to fear.
Equally, it disheartens the country's committed democrats.
Is that compatible with Copenhagen criteria?
Â Â  .
Turkey and Croatia are of course separate issues.
That is what we intend to do.
Â Â  .
That should be our objective.
Â Â  MrÂ Posselt, I am going to interrupt you.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We shall suspend the sitting until voting time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen,
Members of the refuse to associate themselves with this.
Â Â  I am delighted.
Reconciliation is the very basis of the European project.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  We shall continue with the votes.
Â Â  .
I shall read it out:
It begins like this:
Â Â  .
In Amendment 14, Category C has been deleted.
Â Â  The proposal for a regulation has been rejected.
The Commission has the floor.
Â Â  .
I suspect that it should be 2013.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
I should like to know the truth.
Â Â  .
That is what I have done, MrÂ President.
That says it all, really.
Â Â  .
What a revelation!
Â Â  .
We object to this unacceptable position.
That is another important reason for delaying membership negotiations.
Â Â  .
They do so in defiance of international law.
This is without mentioning the Armenian genocide of 1915.
It was a ânoâ from all sides.
Â Â  .
This is also being proven now.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I have the following reasons for this decision.
Â Â  .
They related to:
4/ the denial of the Kurdish issue.
I stand firm in refusing to accept that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Freedom of expression has still not been acquired.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
This is hardly healthy for the economy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I live in the south west of Ireland.
Where commuter lines exist people use them.
Â Â  .
Cooperation must be based on trust and intergovernmental agreements.
Â Â  .
We also wish to reject the proposal itself.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Sterckx report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have therefore chosen to abstain from voting.
Â Â  .
The reserves are there to meet future demand.
Greater market transparency is also needed.
The IEA proceeds by unanimity.
Â Â  .
This only encourages consumers to continue to consume.
Â Â  .
He said the same thing this morning in committee.
Â Â  .
I welcome the forthcoming strategies which Mr Piebalgs mentioned.
Â Â  .
My final question is to the UK Presidency.
That is on the table.
Energy savings and better energy efficiency are priorities.
All forms of renewable energy must be encouraged.
This shows a lack of perspicacity.
The answer, unfortunately, is 'no'.
Alternative energy sources are vital for our future.
Bioethanol is one of these sources.
1.
It is unacceptable that it should remain subsidised indefinitely.
We ought to stabilise oil prices.
Is progress being made?
Your presence is very appropriate.
We must favour alternative fuels such as ethanol.
Energy conservation must come first.
The time has come to discuss this issue openly.
Â Â  .
Mr Papadimoulis raised a number of points.
Mr Konrad raised the issue of refining capacity.
Mr HudackÃ½ raised the issue of nuclear energy.
Â Â  .
I will concentrate my remarks on some particular points.
These are short-term measures that could be adopted.
The Council has already discussed fisheries.
That is the right way to proceed.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Neither is possible without respect for human rights.
But the world is very different 60 years on.
That means winning their support.
Others will be taken forward independently.
Â Â  , .
That is normal at multilateral gatherings.
What were the achievements?
That was thanks to my colleague Mr Michel.
Another negative point was the whole question of disarmament.
Â Â  .
We in the European Union lack a common position.
Â Â  .
The ultimate achievements of the Outcome Document are unsatisfactory.
The glass is half full.
The Millennium Development Goals must be implemented.
Progress on this by Member States is unsatisfactory.
This is disappointing.
A parliamentary assembly should also be considered.
This applies in particular to the Security Council.
Kofi Annanâs proposals are well-known.
The reform has failed in four key areas.
Plans to create a UN Environment Organisation were unsuccessful.
The summit was a failure.
Commissioner, you mentioned âKatrinaâ.
Let us be clear, however.
Harsh words were spoken today about Turkey.
Of these tasks, none has been achieved.
The answer is obvious.
The European Union has not worked effectively enough.
That is further in the future, however.
It was the so-called Beijing +10 Conference.
It is merely an organisation that delivers.
That must change.
We also have a right to protect.
Thank you.
My final point concerns the democratisation of the UN.
We need a parliamentary component.
That is how things stand.
Nothing has changed.
What does all that mean?
That is our problem.
This United Nations Summit was an all-round failure.
What was planned was not achieved.
I am very glad that this change was made.
International law should not be violated.
Reform is nothing to be ashamed of.
Even the tidiest house needs a spring-clean.
There is no disgrace in reform.
The Peacebuilding Commission was given a lot of scope.
Why is this so important?
We must do better.
Â Â  .
It is vital that guarantee is in place.
The next point raised was by Mr Portas.
I can give him the following assurances.
Finally, let me make this other specific point.
I have spoken about that already.
Mr Dillen quoted General Charles de Gaulle.
Â Â  .
Let me just go into this question a little.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let me do my best.
Â Â  'Yes, Minister!'
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
He did not actually answer the question.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I do not believe that helps public enlightenment.
Â Â  .
So, let me repeat it for the record.
Could an inquiry be carried out into these Agreements?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
Â Â  .
He needs to be consistent in his approach.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Does the Council share this appraisal?
Have you made any comments on the specific bill?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is a challenge to the Council.
You can do better.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I find the President-in-Office's remarks quite amazing.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I look forward to that reply.
I hope the Minister catches his plane.
I look forward to continuing this discussion.
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission declaration on Belarus.
Â Â  .
You may ask how the Commission has reacted.
The office will be headed by a .
We have organised three donors meetings this year.
Â Â  .
The political situation is getting worse with every month.
Representatives of all the political groups were involved.
Â Â  .
I will not be repeating what has been said.
But we must not stop here.
Activities in Belarus need to be supported also.
I understand that there were technical obstacles to overcome.
Those were CommissionerÂ Ferrero-Waldnerâs words.
Talk is not enough.
Â Â  .
He said he would revive the Soviet Union.
Lukashenko has delivered on his promise.
This may result in a small border conflict.
I look forward to an answer.
Â Â  .
It shows that history has an impact.
This also applies to Belarus.
We should therefore bear three things in mind.
Parliament cannot therefore remain indifferent to events in Belarus.
Aid should be channelled primarily through Polish bordering regions.
The democratic forces in Belarus are currently totally fragmented.
They cannot even take part in a consortium.
That is a process we should not encourage.
This impact remains to be felt, however.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Rehn.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  â Thank you, MrÂ President.
Â Â  .
My five-minute speech has no room for any more.
Â Â  .
My warm congratulations to the rapporteur.
Â Â  .
India is a nation rich in culture and history.
Its history is intertwined inseparably with European history.
Â Â  .
What a disgrace!
It is a partnership between democrats.
It already has observer status at the G7.
India deserves its own dedicated European Parliament delegation.
The issue of the economy has been raised.
This is one basis for this strategic partnership.
EU-Indian relations are close; we are friends.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Last week I was in Denmark.
We therefore need a political approach.
We also need a systemic approach to energy policy.
Let us look at the sectors.
There was a monitored 80% reduction in energy.
Commissioner, we talk a lot about it.
I think we have to act more fiercely.
We need ownership unbundling.
My final words go to the transport sector.
Transport is the most inefficient sector.
Â Â  .
I really enjoyed reading the report.
You also team energy efficiency with renewable energy.
This sector is very important in the draft.
Â Â  .
It is very much to be welcomed.
Both must be sustainable and provide incomes.
The report has many positive aspects.
We know that this cannot be done overnight.
The efforts being made are insufficient, however.
Renewable energies have been remarkably neglected.
Â Â  .
MrÂ Turmes referred to the sun.
That is something worth noting.
This should be undertaken in individual countries ...
The recent opinion simply emphasises this.
Connecting them to existing energy networks is causing problems.
The report deserves credit and speaks for itself.
That is the way the market mechanisms work.
There is nothing the government can do!
Necessary independent arbitration should not preclude ministerial policy directions.
Â Â  .
The arguments in favour of that are very strong.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
Â Â  .
Yet we should begin with the right to vote.
These are glaring differences.
Â Â  .
They had all arrived from Kosovo six years ago.
All of them are Roma.
They live in refugee camps in their own land.
Â Â  .
Today Kosovo is a human rights vacuum.
In wartime citizens of all ethnic backgrounds flee.
The high level pan-European consortium ...
I find this irresponsible.
This is a violation of fundamental human rights.
Â Â  .
That has to be taken into account, nevertheless.
People have no hope at the moment.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Discrimination affects them in all areas of their lives.
Â Â  .
Debate on traffic safety is a question of attitude.
But that is only money.
Why do we do so little?
When that happened, all Concordes were grounded immediately.
Their lives are shattered, amputated.
You do not recover from it.
You have to live with it.
First of all law enforcement.
There are incredible discrepancies between different States.
We have to learn from one another.
We have to name, shame and fame.
That leads to action.
We must invest more money in infrastructure.
We should have an infrastructure directive on TEN roads.
Europeans are mobile thanks to the European road network.
We have to be just in that allocation.
Yet things are not so bleak.
So cultures can be changed.
We must believe in the new generation.
At the end of the day we are responsible.
Mr President, I know my time is up.
The EU must act decisively.
Â Â  .
The results are noticeable.
My second comment relates to the improvement of infrastructure.
MrÂ Vatanenâs report is therefore very timely.
Yet people are indifferent, unmoved.
Was it a false alarm?
Â Â  .
But they also recognise that there are problems.
Â Â  .
We are a model where technical development is concerned.
Â Â  .
I am therefore very pleased with this debate.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It did not apply unilateral measures.
Â Â  .
My final question is this.
Â Â  .
I have a few very concrete questions, Commissioner.
Where do we go from here?
I hope you can convince me otherwise.
Europe is not adapting quickly enough.
Consumers want cheap T-shirts.
The traders are the same.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I have explained this to MrÂ Mandelson.
It is all technically complex and inefficient.
We could, however, make it much simpler.
I have sent a note to MrÂ Mandelson.
Factories are closing one after the other.
Workers' jobs come before the interests of importers.
The Commission needs to leave all the bombast behind.
You referred to these initiatives, albeit very briefly.
Much of that has changed over the years.
Nobody is expecting change overnight.
We require management, not protectionist measures.
Let us cast our minds back:
The situation we are experiencing is catastrophic.
We are not at the beginning.
They are the ones that are suffering the most.
So is our customs union partner Turkey.
It waited too long.
The high-level group constantly put us off.
The praise for the Commission is therefore very muted.
Consumer prices are also involved.
Can you confirm these figures?
What measures does the European Commission intend to take?
Today we are faced with a global phenomenon.
What did we do?
That would unquestionably help the European textile industry.
That is what we need in the European Union.
Labelling must be discussed with the WTO.
That is the best way for further development.
It is a difficult tightrope.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
To be honest, it is not very reassuring.
I urge Members to support this report.
Â Â  .
Both aspects are well reflected in this report.
However, the EU position is under challenge.
The European industry is losing ground in high-technology products.
Â Â  .
China joined the WTO in 2001.
That means new rights, but also new obligations.
Things cannot go on as they are.
Please tell that to Commissioner Mandelson.
We need more commercial freedom and more commercial responsibility.
Â Â  .
If we do not, others will.
We also need a serious political dialogue with China.
We have much to say to each other.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What must we say in these circumstances?
She will have mine.
What has changed?
There are a number of unusual things about China.
It also has high-tech production.
That is something different.
I believe that is the right way forward.
That cannot be the way either.
We must invest much more in education.
They should be treated with the utmost severity.
It is plenary that will decide on that shortly.
That is what I can tell you.
I have no other option.
The problem, however, has not gone away.
The value of the Chinese currency remains artificially low.
Imports to Europe also increase our purchasing power.
I believe this will strengthen our relations in future.
We all ought to give this our backing.
Emphatically, something must be done about these.
So thank you to the European Commission.
And international companies play a large part in this.
However, I want to deal with another issue.
Trade cannot be viewed in isolation.
It is not immune from ethical and moral considerations.
China needs our trade.
The price attached can properly be more than financial.
Â Â  .
That is what caused this problem.
Â Â  We shall now move on to the votes.
The same procedure applies as for the other part.
It is about democracy in the United Nations.
I will now read the text out in English.
The following is appended to Part 20:
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
The resolution reiterates its support for:
â (B6-0461/2005): Oil
Â Â  .
Â Â  .I voted in favour of this text.
What kind of price increase are we talking about?
I would also like to address the Commission:
Â Â  .
The time has come to adopt progressive technological solutions.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of this resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We voted against the unacceptable text condemning Belarus.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Bioenergy is unnecessary.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Political responsibility lies with the national parliaments.
Â Â  .
This laudable objective has my full support.
Â Â  .
A quarter of these fatalities were 15-24 years old.
This is a shocking figure.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
However, we have several reservations.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
That is easy to demonstrate.
We do need safeguards, though.
It would have been polite.
China is producing two million graduates a year.
China has its own way of doing things.
Â Â  .
I do not think that will work.
This, I believe, is a promising option.
And the changes are accelerating.
China has changed, and so have our relations.
We have achieved a breakthrough in different fields.
That makes me optimistic.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It must be sustained and reciprocated.
However, it has so much to offer.
The international community must support peaceful negotiations.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Journalists continue to be banned from voicing their opinions.
Â Â  .
We in the EU must also play our part.
It is long overdue.
Â Â  .
They have nothing to lose if the war continues.

Furthermore, the social status of women needs improving.

Â Â  The debate is closed.

Klementina recoiled in horror and ran back inside.
This has not happened.
This has not happened.
This has not happened either.
The grace period is almost up.
Mrs Pack has also referred to this.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We understand the difficulties of the democratic Serbian Government.
Â Â  .
Or could we be deceiving ourselves?
Oppression breeds oppression.
This is the only strategic solution.
A tremendous amount of money is going to Serbia.
All these things are unacceptable.
There is graffiti abusing native Hungarians.
This is our duty.
The proposal on the floor is categorical and constructive.
Â Â  .
The authorities still have much to do.
Let me mention just a few examples.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 5 p.m.
Â Â  Are there any objections to the oral amendment?
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
The damage has been greatest in Kashmir in particular.
A great tragedy has struck Central America.
That is not on!
Commissioner McCreevy is entitled to his opinions.
What he said in Sweden is perfectly normal.
I oppose the motion.
That is how things stand as regards the vote.
We should simply call it by its name.
We shall have other such debates, moreover.
(1)
Â Â  .
Member States must shoulder this burden together.
However, this has clearly not been enough.
This work needs to continue.
Here we are making concrete progress.
Â Â  .
Mr President, today is a special day.
Â Â  .
They are fleeing extreme poverty, destitution or violence.
Our asylum policy needs to match our values.
We already have the answer.
Fortress Europe does not exist.
It is a fantasy.
Â Â  .
Many of us remember such scenes from Bible study.
Our futures are interdependent.
Partnership is certainly the way forward.
Why?
We need a consensus on economic policy.
Â Â  .
Is that acceptable?
Â Â  .
What is the immediate cause?
What is the solution?
That is the solution we must support.
What, then, can be done?
We will visit Malta in January.
We await some answers.
That is not true.
Â Â  .
The Council does not share his view.
The long-term solution lies in working in partnership.
Â Â  .
Migration has many causes.
Now Europe is an attractive place.
Many sleepless nights.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Iran now has a new President and Government.
Many Iranians are highly entrepreneurial.
Let me therefore start with the latter.
It remains to be seen how Iran will respond.
We hope it will choose that constructive path.
Progress was halting but nonetheless real.
It is clearly imperative that it should happen.
In recent months freedom of expression has also suffered.
Â Â  .
The next session should be held in Tehran.
We are waiting for Iran to make practical suggestions.
We are still waiting for Iranâs response.
Each is a matter of deep concern.
These two tracks are indivisible and mutually reinforcing.
They are also dependent on the overall political atmosphere.
The Commission has also played its part.
Â Â  .
I have in mind Israel, Pakistan and India.
It concerns declaring the Iranian Mujahedin a terrorist organisation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
A democratic Europe must take this opposition seriously.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What sort of response have these received?
Of course they are!
Nevertheless, we need to stop its military programme.
It would be great if this were to happen.
I am not expressing the opinion of my Group.
The number of public executions has increased.
What does that mean?
So we have to proceed down another path: .
To dispel Iran's fears.
To reduce its intolerance and to disarm its fanaticism.
Fanaticism is worse than a nuclear bomb.
We are cornering the cat.
What the Americans want is irrational.
I now turn to the resolution.
That is something for us to think about.
Â Â  .
That is what its young population deserves.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
This has been clearly demonstrated in two instances.
Â Â  Special pleading for farmers has no sympathy from me.
Â Â  â I would like to talk about Kazakhstan.
Thank you.
That is a step in the right direction.
Europe is once again splitting into two parts.
They are claiming the name of Greek Macedonia.
We are calling for justice at long last.
Do you understand?
The truth is killing us.
We want an initiative by the European Union.
Are we serious about lowering our domestic energy use?
It is important that early decisions are made.
Â Â  Thank you for that.
I am sure Mr Michel was listening with interest.
That concludes the one-minute speeches.
These organisations now embody the hope of the continent.
It is not enough for EU aid to increase.
Its effectiveness needs also to be improved.
Let us return to the subject of coherence.
First principle: equality.
Europe has more to offer than development aid.
Second principle: partnership.
Third principle: appropriation.
Â Â  .
That is not an ideal situation.
Poverty is at its worst there, and growing.
The primary responsibility is theirs.
Ownership is desirable in both cases.
My time is up.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have therefore set Millennium Development Goals.
The formula for development is fairly well-known.
Infrastructure is one of these factors.
Money is not enough to prevent this from happening.
It is not enough to mobilise funds.
Africa must help itself.
Secondly, our policies must be coherent and coordinated.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, Africa is an unfortunate continent.
Secondly, there is education, education and education.
Then there is the matter of combating diseases.
I think that is what the Commissioner was doing.
It is what we should do.
We should draw out the talents of Africans.
We should build on the resources of Africa.
Clearly the Millennium Development Goals are fundamental to this.
As a small example the twinning partnerships are highlighted.
They are based in Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrsÂ Kinnock is right.
Africa does not need more weapons.
The strategy shows that more needs to be done.
They must themselves decide what is in their interests.
That also applies to our research policy.
I wish to raise five points.
I therefore support the Commission on this issue.
That is your challenge.
Population growth is another issue.
However, this objective cannot implement itself.
Yet, the results were insignificant.
Â Â  .
I am like you.
Members have spoken about the effectiveness of the strategy.
That is what our partners are confronted with.
We need to know what is desired.
I wanted to make that point clear.
You are entirely justified in emphasising this matter.
My final remark concerns trade.
Is it enough?
We need to be aware of that.
PresidentÂ KonarÃ© fully explained this to us this morning.
This demonstrates that subtle distinctions are useful.
The debate is closed.
Sounds familiar?
Â Â  .
I believe that that is absolutely crucial.
How wrong we were!
Â Â  .
I still am.
Â Â  .
It is now five months since the election.
They had faith in the electoral process.
There are no winners in the current impasse.
Other speakers have gone over what has happened.
I saw how beautiful democracy can be!
Â Â  .
That is what I truly believe.
We have put pressure on him.
That is what I believe.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  .
This report therefore defines the priority fields of action.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
A keystone in an arch is the central piece.
A cornerstone is the one at the corner.
My government is not here.
Governments know nothing about job creation.
Employers create jobs, governments do not.
Governments frustrate the creation of jobs.
They frustrate the profession of the teachers.
Â Â  .
Finally, our group will support this report.
Â Â  .
No real initiative is in sight, unfortunately.
Â Â  .
Why is this?
These restrictions frustrate the free movement of students.
We must also care for them with equal zeal.
That is your strategy.
Teachers therefore have a very important part to play.
Investment in education never goes to waste.
I should like to thank the rapporteur.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  .
We now have 45Â countries in the Bologna process.
Recommendation D is about universitiesâ choice of agency.
Recommendation E on licensing and funding is deleted.
International reputation enhancement is added.
I welcome this.
The Commission can accept the amendments.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There is scope for abuse in connection with accreditation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
This is the purpose of the report before us.
This is the way it should be.
This is the least we can do!
Â Â  .
Migrants stay in the host countries.
Let me recall its key underlining principles.
I therefore look forward to our forthcoming discussions.
Â Â  .
The EU can make this possible.
Â Â  .
Multilingualism, therefore, has two dimensions.
Multilingualism creates new prospects.
I shall try to speak in French.
Do we really learn foreign languages in our schools?
Well, in England we certainly do not.
That is Racine.
I could say that aged 18.
Could I buy a ticket on the metro?
No!
So how do we integrate immigrants?
I have no time to explain further.
The PPE-DE Group supports this report.
I should also like to highlight three additional points:
Â Â  .
Mr President, thank you for your encouragement.
Let me mention just two of them.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
That will make things easier for the performers.
Â Â  .
The report covers all dimensions of the circus.
This is particularly true of circus professionals.
Mrs Pack has put them on the map.
Â Â  .
We politicians have to settle for that.
Not much has changed on that front.
I share their concern.
Â Â  Mr President, the circus is magic for children.
The circus is a special entertainment for adults.
It is a good approach.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Combating extreme poverty means respecting the rights of everybody.
But that is not enough.
What are we talking about?
And why refuse them the right to gynaeco-obstetrical health?
As a doctor, I do not understand that.
In fact, I find it insulting.
Let me cite just one example.
Â Â  .
In certain countries, the difference is even greater.
Â Â  .
It is an act of justice.
What will the future be like?
The media, as an example ...
Yet it is for sale here.
No it is not!
Â Â  MrÂ President, we live in strange times.
A woman running a household does not feel unemployed.
Their strong family life is their fortune.
Fewer behavioural problems arise in families of this kind.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The risk of poverty is linked to unemployment.
This risk increases if unemployment remains high.
Economic, employment and social policies are mutually reinforcing.
Asserting human rights also helps to alleviate poverty.
Deep poverty does exist in Europe.
Â Â  I declare the sitting closed.
The groups were asked to speak on the motion.
The IND/DEM Group was simply skipped.
I have observed this before.
Mr McCreevy has of course always opposed that model.
On our chaotic health system?
On our crumbling school buildings?
On a very excluding special needs education system?
On our housing crisis?
Not our Charlie!
I wish to stress the terms urban and suburban.
What is the question before us today?
Is that not a huge waste?
We already have objectives.
What are those resources?
I presume you have all read this own-initiative report.
I shall conclude by emphasising good practice.
Â Â  .
A working paper will complement the Community strategic guidelines.
Cities can make an important contribution to these.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
They are probably less inclined to share power.
Â Â  .
We pay the bills.
It is here that most migrants arrive.
They need far-reaching and tangible help.
Special attention should therefore be paid to cities.
Our towns and cities are not isolated.
There is in fact a very simple solution.
78% of us live in cities.
That is already a step in the right direction.
I unreservedly endorse this report.
Good regional policy also implies good urban policy.
Â Â  .
We have listened very carefully.
Mrs Krehl raised the point of the financial perspective.
Two or three specific issues were also raised.
Housing was mentioned in different contexts.
I now turn to the report.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
They are therefore difficult to implement and to control.
Many key articles were rejected outright.
This is equivalent as far as quality is concerned.
It was a Polish and German idea.
The flexible nature of certain articles also became clearer.
Completion is set for 2008.
Here ends the tale of my report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for tabling this proposal.
I now await your next initiative.
Â Â  .
Thank you.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this report.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
It did not happen.
Â Â  â The next item is the vote.
I would be obliged to you if you could.
Thank you.
Our job will thereby be made that much easier.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
I therefore voted in favour.
The extra information is crucial.
The Baltic Sea has its own characteristics.
Â Â  .
That is why we are voting against the report.
This is unacceptable.
We cannot, therefore, support the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This ought to be our challenge.
The first relates to internal matters.
The second recommendation relates to matters outside the EU.
Globalisation produces winners and losers.
This is very regrettable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
No more escalation in the nuclear dispute with Iran!
We shall be keeping a close eye on matters.
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  .
This proposal will only promote the formation of ghettos.
It is the world on its head.
Â Â  .
Integration policy is more than a policy of tolerance.
I did so for the following reasons:
Â Â  .
Unfortunately, this is not happening.
I therefore voted in favour of the Beaupuy report.
Â Â  .
Why women?
I therefore voted in favour of the ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ report.
Parliament is remembering this fellow Member today.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Debate without resolution!
Â Â  Mr Liese has the floor to speak against.
(1)
This is not something we want to see.
I would ask that we all do that.
Estonia is a full Member of the EU.
This concerns the Unionâs external border.
Yesterday's edition was of particular interest.
The reason for this is obvious.
Common sense may eventually prevail.
What is happening is an absolute scandal.
There are only 877Â driftnet fishermen in Ireland.
We have firmly condemned a form of political irresponsibility.
The message of the revolution for posterity is threefold.
The events of 1956 were profoundly democratic.
Â Â  Mr President, poverty is silent.
The sights are crying out, as well.
However, this cannot be achieved without community expenditure.
Obviously he is right.
This has never happened before.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.
This has made life for disabled passengers unbearable.
I hope we will.
It is not enough to blame national governments.
Security in the Balkans means security in Europe.
Â Â  That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  .
The prime criterion for their selection will be quality.
Therefore, we accept the amendment to this effect.
Â Â  .
I hope that Parliament will agree to this.
Let me briefly consider the issue of finance.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
In so doing, they add value to Europe.
Â Â  .
Several speakers referred to lifelong learning as a right.
This represents a great change.
This is something that also deserves notice.
This is basically all I wanted to discuss.
This is a sound premise for success.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The coherence and synergy makes it even more efficient.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Cooperation has been excellent.
That is the first step.
Â Â  .
We stand right behind these figures.
What will happen when the Luxembourg figures come in?
I would like to highlight a few points.
They should not be bureaucratically managed from Brussels.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Congratulations, Mrs GrÃ¶ner!
However, this also demands greater funding.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
Thank you for considering this approach.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
It is important to continue to support this action.
We fully understand that concern.
This is a paltry amount!
Â Â  .
Globalisation is an irreversible fact.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
My third point concerns the commemoration sites.
Â Â  .
It is balanced, consistent and demanding.
Violence exists; it is aimed at destroying culture.
It is also a great victory for European culture.
Â Â  .
This is a bad move.
The British Presidency continues to block the financial perspective.
It was high time this problem was highlighted.
Point duly made.
Thank you.
Even pregnant women were shown no mercy.
They were conceived together.
They divided Europe through the Hitler-Stalin pact.
More, much more is needed today.
Their next meeting is scheduled for November.
This is a value that calls for further investment.
There will also be other reasons.
It is about the values that culture embodies.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Position of the Commission
Â Â  .
There are 77 amendments.
We must help to improve digitisation.
There are three groups of amendments.
There is therefore no need to repeat them.
That is a crucial priority for the MEDIA programme.
Â Â  .
Production itself remains a matter for the Member States.
What changes does the programme propose to make?
One is a substantial increase in funding.
Apart from that, what else has changed?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I will therefore get on to the main point.
MEDIA 2007 is the first post-enlargement programme.
The addition of subtitles is closely linked to digitisation.
Â Â  .
Fortunately, the solutions are at our hands.
I might include my own country Lithuania.
Thank you.
The European audiovisual sector is highly fragmented.
However, the problem is not one of numbers.
It is primarily cultural.
Of course not.
Â Â  .
It has an economic dimension.
This is the Europe that we cherish.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
On this we can all readily agree.
European legislation is still fragmented.
Â Â  .
I feel this is unjustified.
Â Â  .
Regrettably, the compromise does not cover this issue.
Neither does it properly address dismantling of ships.
This attempt at including them is also dangerous.
I have just a couple more points on shipment.
To do so would be wrong.
Rules must be enacted to prevent such a thing.
One example is ferrous metals.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Annex â Position of the Commission
Â Â  .
I urge colleagues to support this proposal.
Industry must be given long-term certainty.
Â Â  .
Fluorinated gases are very strong greenhouse gases.
Â Â  .
What is this amendment about?
I therefore ask you to support this amendment.
Â Â  .
The common position is disappointing.
Unfortunately, they were unable to do so.
Â Â  .
This is an environmental issue.
Â Â  .
That is why we have tabled Amendment 45.
I shall therefore vote against this amendment.
I intend to vote for Amendment 45 instead.
The whole globe shares the same ozone layer.
I thank Mrs Doyle for her work.
It has been a very interesting debate.
I also thank Commissioner Dimas.
That is most important.
Thank you for your support.
Â Â  .
I believe this will satisfy all concerns.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 26Â October.
Annex â Position of the Commission
Regulation (2003/0189A (COD))
Directive (2003/0189B (COD))
Â Â  .
It concerns what is known as the Laval case.
The essential questions are clear.
We need to promote union, not artificial boundaries.
Let me now give the floor to Commissioner McCreevy.
Â Â  .
This analysis is complex and will take some time.
Those are the facts of the matter.
To be credible, there is no alternative.
I was not the first to raise this question.
I have sworn to do so.
There are 25 Member States in the Union.
I make no distinction between them.
I have never hidden these views.
No single system has only advantages.
Every system and every choice has downsides.
Choices and preferences may also change.
We should not be afraid of the internal market.
We should embrace it.
We have a Union of 25 Member States.
That is what this is about.
By that shall we be judged.
These are the principles by which our group stands.
To that we are opposed.
They accuse the Commission of being off-centre.
The EU is like a football team.
This is a strategic choice.
This is now under severe threat.
Let us look at the clear facts before us.
But what do we see happening?
That is my first observation.
Why?
This is the value of delegating and sharing responsibility.
He is saying the same thing today.
No.
Is it more protectionist?
Is it discriminatory?
The answer is no.
You talked about Spain and Portugal, MrÂ Barroso.
What is it you are advocating now?
Yes, a race to the bottom.
You should think carefully.
This will not create a European social model.
Employees are not commodities.
What is the money we create for?
Social model advocates â where were you then?
They lost, however.
This is not about the Services Directive.
They most certainly do.
Much uncertainty surrounds the case as a whole.
That is what we all need.
Let us study this remarkable model.â
You have to build consensus here or you fail.
Take note or fail.
Â Â  .
On the first question, concerning trade unions.
Do they have the right to strike?
There is no doubt about it.
We must strictly abide by the Treaties.
In fact, there are 25 of us now.
That is the issue at stake.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
These plans must seek to:
- avoid panic among the general public;
- ensure fair and universal distribution of anti-epidemic products;
Do we have 25%?
All this has to be done.
We need a comprehensive communication strategy.
Â Â  .
I shall close here.
That applies to the Commission and to Member States.
They need to be informed and reassured.
We need capacity and speed.
It is not yet obviously affecting humankind.
We have seen that.
The stakes are high and time might be short.
We must help the poorer countries do this.
There is no pandemic.
Is there an epidemic?
Perhaps there is no epidemic either.
Has the virus attacked man?
Yes it has.
Is there a vaccine?
My country is killing 25 million chickens.
So will we give them all an allowance?
Tomorrow we debate the budget.
Is there a heading for this sort of pandemic?
We ought to be aware of this, Commissioner.
We need to be aware of it!
What will people say when a pandemic occurs?
Exchanging good practices and decisions needs to be encouraged.
What do you intend to do in this regard?
Money is therefore required.
First of all, we need emergency measures.
We have to be ready.
Â Â  â Commissioner, thank you for your introduction.
My second question concerns the availability of medicines.
Which products exactly will you be making available?
When that occurs, a human epidemic can result.
This is not panic-mongering.
The Commission and the Council must lay down measures.
What will happen when migratory birds reach Africa?
Who has responsibility for this?
I am quite sure that we share it.
Â Â  .
The international aspect is very important.
I mentioned that last time.
Nevertheless, there have been some developments.
Sometimes the media exaggerate.
That is a risk we have to take.
It is therefore natural that people are worried.
We need both national and Community plans.
We have to be realistic about that.
That will happen.
The daily warning system works very well.
The debate is closed.
The threat of a pandemic is real.
It is in these tragic circumstances that Europe finds its
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
We have doubled production and globalised our economy.
We have also looked to Europeâs experience.
We remember these events with nothing but gratitude.
The authoritarian Constitution has been amended.
The workers have been given back their rights.
I am sure you understand what I am saying!
Why not say it?
We must not be afraid of globalisation.
We are building our partnership.
Not just Spaniards.
We want Europe to have greater presence over there.
We see our Association Agreement as a significant step.
At times we have taken different directions.
Many times.
You supported us during difficult times.
Thank you very much for inviting me.
Â Â  That concludes voting time.
Hence our vote against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  in writing.
Â Â  .
This report has my wholehearted support.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Well, that is propaganda.
Â Â  I welcomed this report.
Â Â  Cultural issues are, of course, very important.
Law-making should be results-orientated.
I voted in favour of the GraÃ§a Moura report.
I am therefore voting against this proposal.
The previous MEDIA programmes produced good results.
I have therefore proposed amendments to fill those gaps.
I voted in favour of the Hieronymi report.
Otherwise we would go straight into the debate.
Â Â  .
I therefore apologise for being somewhat late.
Both have also pursued structural reforms to their economies.
Labour market reforms also need to be enhanced.
Over 50% of all areas monitored are non-problematic.
This covers around a third of the areas.
Some of these areas require a technical solution.
The total volume of pre-accession assistance available is substantial.
I have cut off your microphone.
In December 2004, we decided to close negotiations.
A great deal of progress is required.
This desire has not been brought into question.
I think that is quite tremendous.
Bulgaria has made progress to an enormous degree.
So let us consider the justice system.
The moment of truth has now arrived.
Has the new government succeeded or failed?
Allow me to single out two of them.
The Commission is right to focus on this.
That is unacceptable.
We have often mentioned yellow cards.
What about the orphans and food safety?
Will it take action?
However, problems do exist.
Progress has continued in Bulgaria.
It is insufficient merely to pass laws.
They were not sure of the best way ahead.
There is no need yet.
This is the best report yet for Romania.
This has already happened in some sectors.
I seek no time delay.
The criticism of them is justified.
You may well ask why this is so.
A practical example would be the steel industry.
What other industries have similar deals hidden away?
I shall focus on Rumania.
The progress made must serve as a stimulus.
They will have our full support in this task.
That too must be debated.
I should like to touch on three of those.
Real unemployment in Bulgaria and Romania is terrifyingly high.
Huge industrial and livestock units are closing.
The health and education system is breaking down.
This situation also has consequences for Greece.
Proprietary rights cannot be enforced.
This is naturally unacceptable.
That is true, moreover.
But serious efforts are required, indeed.
We would like Romania to join in 2007.
Where has he found real grounds for concern?
In 10% of these areas.
The situation of Romania is more complex.
Another heavy burden is the Roma issue.
Romania is still a long way from this.
However, the message must be clear.
First of all, there is the continuing corruption.
The directive is expected to be issued in December.
Why do I ask this question?
This is not happening in Romania yet.
The Commission needs to monitor this matter closely.
We need emergency fostering situations in those cases.
That is something we need to address.
The uncertainties over the financial perspective are a worry.
Â Â  .
They are in quite good shape.
Inspections at external borders also need to be improved.
Some Members asked about genetically modified organisms.
Comparisons to football have been made in this Chamber.
Â Â  The debate on this item is closed.
Â Â  .
We have a piece of legislation here.
Â Â  .
It strengthens my determination to see this regulation enforced.
Â Â  â I welcome the Commissioner's reply.
There are numerous examples.
Please be vigorous in chasing them up.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This needs to become a regular practice.
Everything comes down to enforcing this regulation.
Â Â  .
We await the findings of this inquiry.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is an interesting question.
If so, when did it do so?
Â Â  .
The decision has not yet been taken.
Â Â  That, unfortunately, is not possible.
Â Â  .
We all agree.
That is the situation today.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The question is a very interesting one.
Â Â  .
Then there was a question about funding.
Â Â  .
Maybe you could answer this question.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is a matter for the Government.
Â Â  .
There are similar applications in other European countries.
Perhaps you can enlighten us?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There are differences between the various Member States.
Â Â  .
The Commission remains committed to that end.
Â Â  â Commissioner, thank you for your response.
Â Â  .
I saw President Bush and Condoleezza Rice.
We spoke about that.
I saw Mr Wolfensohn before that meeting.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These are key EU priorities for the whole region.
Let me give just a few examples.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner, for your explanation.
Â Â  .
That means that there very definitely are conditions attached.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  â Thank you for that answer.
I am interested in your review.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â I come from Scotland.
We are worried about the future of salmon stocks.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are eagerly awaiting a response to their comments.
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  .
There are some who are generally opposed to patents.
This is incorrect in accordance with the Directive.
It is indeed an infringement of the Directive.
Human sperm cells are being patented.
That is most definitely excluded.
We would therefore ask the Commission to clarify this.
The designer patent is scandalous.
That bodes well for the future.
Parliament should take its monitoring task seriously.
The first of these is common human decency.
We should not consent to such a thing.
Drug manufacturers would earn nothing in such instances.
Such are the consequences of patents on cells.
Today we are faced with an unambiguous case.
The precautionary principle must apply.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Another interesting topic in the report is informant protection.
Then we can give it flat-out support.
We want to confiscate the profits of organised crime.
That is the way to hit them hardest.
Europol is still much weaker than it should be.
We must invest in confidence in these systems.
We do not see this as the primary objective.
The public expects a fight against organised crime.
We shall not be supporting this report, therefore.
These criminal activities urgently need to be suppressed.
That says quite a lot about the money involved.
I also like the ambitious goals of the report.
They are very conservative on these matters.
We should have done it a long time ago.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Catania.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Let us not fool ourselves, though.
What prospects do we have to offer them?
That is one aspect.
That is a further aspect.
National competences, of course, remain unaffected.
However, the document is contradictory.
Thank you.
We want cultural diversity.
Let us be clear.
We forget that in this debate.
That is the problem we have to face.
No State can take such decisions alone.
We must be realistic.
That is not the answer.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Let us be clear on this.
In the energy sector there is no change.
I should just like to add one comment.
That is welcome and desirable.
We regard the energy sector with some sadness.
He has the broad support of our group.
Not a great deal has happened in this regard.
We shall support the Commissioner on this path.
A drastic change in transport policy is needed.
A couple of people will become richer, though.
The Brussels coffers have whetted their appetite.
That is the only question that matters.
Furthermore, the project has certain negative political implications.
That is something that I could not support.
Thus they deserve our utmost commitment.
Â Â  .
A word now on the budgetary envelope.
These are Amendments 19 and 20.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
They are not covered by the current proposal.
Their variegation is achieved mostly by adding additives.
The exemptions must be carefully evaluated.
They demand a broader scientific debate.
That right surely supersedes any marketing tactics or side-effects.
The foodstuffs industry fills these gaps.
Â Â  .
I did not thank the rapporteur.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
We shall examine
First, what is the budget?
I shall give you some examples.
My second example is research.
Can we leave these instruments without adequate funding?
Lastly, external actions.
Â Â  .
Various measures have already been taken.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Dombrovskis.
Â Â  .
I shall go through the various headings.
There are no vacant posts left.
We are doing our best.
The second point concerns aid for reconstruction in Iraq.
Â Â  .
We all know that this budget is very stretched.
The earthquake represents a challenge.
They have no tents, food or water.
I do not know.
I would like that to be noted.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I should like to make three points.
What happened?
We got nothing!
The five proposals were all rejected.
That is in all our interests.
For that we need money.
The answer, of course, is no.
Â Â  .
A new procedure really ought to be drawn up.
This situation cannot continue.
We are therefore coming up against some great difficulties.
This improved situation will have to continue.
The appropriations are realistic and necessary.
Â Â  .
This policy cannot be allowed to continue.
Â Â  .
The challenges facing the European Union are as follows.
Firstly, economic growth is slowing.
Secondly, EU businesses are becoming less competitive.
Unfortunately this year has been no exception.
There is very little room for complacency.
We need to carry on further down this road.
That is not the case.
Quite right too!
We have signed off the common agricultural policy.
Our word should be our bond.
These calculations do not come out like that.
I just want to make four points.
I support that proposal.
Parliament should not constantly try to increase the budget.
That is going too far.
Parliament has already sketched out its strategy.
The Ministers for Finance again thought predominantly like accountants.
The question which arises, therefore, is political.
However, that is not enough.
That is why democracy should verify these.
This is a big mistake.
The solution is not less, but more Europe.
When?
Â Â  .
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The next item is Voting Time.
1.
2.
Â Â  .
The legal base is an important issue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the Florenz report.
Â Â  .
Europe must invest in transport and energy infrastructure.
Â Â  .
I welcome this.
Â Â  .
Trans-European Networks were intended to compensate for past shortcomings.
I therefore voted in favour of the Mauro report.
We have voted against the report as a whole.
Â Â  .
We are against this particular point.
That is all well and good.
How is this growth measured?
Which data actually reflect what is happening?
Things cannot be allowed to continue in this vein.
As politicians, can we tolerate this situation?
No.
Â Â  .
It is no such thing.
â Motion for a resolution: RC-B6-0551/2005
Â Â  .
This legislation has to be rapidly revised.
Â Â  .
For what reason?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We should learn from our past mistakes.
Providing for derogations and exceptions is unacceptable.
Thank you, Mr Blair.
You have the floor.
Â Â  .
The question is how we do that.
I should like to mention some of those.
The second area is energy and energy policy.
I thought certain things might get a mixed reception.
The third area concerns universities.
We need to take those lessons further.
I would also like to make one other point.
That could be an important signal for the future.
That is our desire.
Â Â  .
I will not go back over that presentation.
The gap between rich and poor is too great.
Let me underline some of those aspects.
People are not statistics.
That is why we are now working very hard.
Â Â  .
Nowadays, everything is interconnected.
I have made many visits to Morocco.
You are a good communicator â everyone knows that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let me be clear.
This poses a danger to our economic future.
Yesterdayâs solutions are no longer an option.
As my German friends tell me, it is .
But do not give up.
What it needs from the Presidency is leadership.
The time has come to lead from the front.
That means high ideals.
What are your ideals for Europe, Mr Blair?
It is followership.
Â Â  .
Everything is fine up to that point.
Go on, laugh.
So what has happened since?
So it all looks rather encouraging.
Â Â  .
It is good to see you, Sir.
You have little or nothing to show for it.
It is too leftist and federalist for most Conservatives.
Â Â  .
That is the purpose of what we are doing.
Environmental technology is another area.
That is a very good social record.
I think that is the right position for us.
Again, I understand.
All of this is true.
It is not a question of abandoning social solidarity.
Why?
That is what this debate is about.
However, we can re-train, re-skill.
We can give people support in finding new jobs.
It was change that led to the European Union.
Why should we not be confident?
Of course not!
Let Europe be relevant on these issues.
Do you believe that the Euro-sceptics want change?
Tomorrow, we will have the informal summit.
Let us agree the Commission paper.
We can do it.
They are posing the questions.
They are wanting our leadership.
It is time we gave it to them.â
Where is the leadership on the Doha Round?
Is the PrimeÂ Minister prepared to defend those?
Where is the leadership on the future of Europe?
Time is short, winter approaches.
We wait for some real results.
With regard to deregulation measures ...
I am obliged to him for saying this.
Just do it!
We are waiting for you.
We have zero progress and continuing uncertainty.
Zero progress.
For them, you are too modern.
For us, you are not modern enough.
However, I shall have another go.
I would like to end by saying:
Â Â  MrÂ President, Europe has broken down.
The constitution has broken down.
The budget has broken down.
The inspiration has broken down.
You will not resolve this crisis with less Europe.
Europe is primarily a political project.
Do not disappoint them!
Stop disappointing them!
Is it possible for us to achieve more together?
That would be a good start.
It is nothing but empty rhetoric.
Thank you MrÂ Blair!
I hope that will happen at the summit.
Orientations are not enough and actions are not enough.
What, then, should we do?
Hopes rose in the new Member States.
In June we heard about political leadership.
Are we any closer to a satisfactory solution?
The EUâs credibility is at stake here.
The deadlock needs to be broken.
We are running out of time.
That is putting the cart before the horse.
Instead of delivery we have vision.
Please think it over.
Â Â  .
Mrs De Sarnez raised the same question.
Â Â  .
I was disappointed only from one point of view.
Â Â  That concludes the item.
How very cynical!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Clearly that will involve a number of Member States.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Serbia is refusing help to recover those bodies.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am grateful for the opportunity to respond.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is far from being the case.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The honourable Member specifically mentioned the optical radiation directive.
Â Â  Thank you, President-in-Office, for your reply.
It was brought forward by the Council of Ministers.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The simple answer is âyesâ.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you for that reply.
Â Â  .
The European Union is ready to help.
Â Â  President-in-Office, I am encouraged by your reply.
Â Â  .
This is completely counterproductive.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you for your response.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you for that response, President-In-Office.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Further research into respiratory diseases would be timely.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Commission has made no such proposal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We will work to achieve that.
Â Â  .
Let me address both of those points in turn.
I know because I was there.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
My question is a follow-up.
I would urge you to do that.
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  .
This has followed the process since July.
Its presence was extremely important.
What comes next, after the Bonn process?
What should the compact do?
It should focus particularly on Afghan ownership and sustainability.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We know now that many women were elected.
These plans must not be forgotten.
Â Â  .
These are combat operations.
Of course, this problem also affects neighbouring countries.
I would like to make one final important point.
Â Â  .
Lithuanians are helping to build the new Afghanistan.
More European states could do the same.
Thank you.
I chose to monitor the women-only polling stations.
They had no education.
We cannot give up.
The country is desperately poor.
This issue is one of extreme complexity.
Â Â  .
There are no clear party blocks.
Parliament will certainly be very fragmented.
Ultimately, that has proved to be the case.
That is a very positive development.
Finally, education is one of the key questions.
We also have a specific project for street children.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the November part-session.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
As such, they have new rights and obligations.
Nevertheless, the short-term goal must be democratic elections.
Â Â  .
Any electoral improvement is welcome.
And Baku can prove itself on 6 November.
Instead, it has resulted in much speculation.
Â Â  .
We also discussed the question of these flights.
We hope that there will be a change.
It is a very complicated question.
They only wanted one of their own.
I hope that the Azeris will hear our message.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
But history is history.
It was then that the Barcelona Process began.
One is education.
There the situation is exactly the same.
The ability to read is therefore important for democracy.
Â Â  .
The third area is that of economic development.
I do hope that we will accomplish that.
Â Â  .
I would now like to turn to my proposal.
The results, 10 years on, are mixed.
The region is still unstable.
The results to date are not satisfactory.
Both sides have been guilty of weaknesses and oversights.
Â Â  .
Environmental cooperation is also one of our priorities.
Â Â  .
The fight against terrorism has become ever more important.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These countries must evolve.
What is missing are the governments.
Where are the governments?
This clearly makes the partnership less coherent.
The situation today is entirely different.
The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is an extraordinary success.
Firstly, we should avoid spreading ourselves too thinly.
It could be a win-win situation.
I agree with it.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your resolute proposals.
Everyone spoke of results that were not particularly encouraging.
How will they operate without adequate financing?
For some, this may be confusing.
Let me explain.
Why is that so important?
There, I am very hopeful.
Otherwise I certainly would have attended.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I closed 251 inquires during the year.
Â Â  .
We consider this matter with an open mind.
This is the reason why we welcome your report.
Â Â  .
âWhich right has been violated?â
âWhich institution should take action?â
What is this saying?
Â Â  .
That is a fact that cannot be ignored.
Â Â  .
Why is this so?
Countless similar complaints are received day by day.
I should like to congratulate you on this score.
Â Â  .
I want to thank the Commissioner for that publicly.
I have asked for further information.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Swoboda.
We take good note of your request.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
I entirely agree.
Â Â  Is there any opposition from the political groups?
Â Â  Then we shall proceed as planned.
Â Â  Is there any opposition?
We do not understand these last-minute changes.
We are not voting on the amounts.
There is only a remark on it.
That is the only change.
We will vote only on the remark.
We will vote on the figures later.
Â Â  You are absolutely right.
We shall proceed as planned.
It is the whole row.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Amendment 263:
Amendment 440:
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
They were aimed at:
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I accordingly voted to end this practice.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Common responses to the issue of immigration are required.
Â Â  .
I welcome this report.
There can be no security behind barriers.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the JÃ¤Ã¤tteenmÃ¤ki report.
Hence our vote in favour.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the Mavrommattis report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That has not been done.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is fair enough.
Â Â  .
That would have created a precedent.
Let me move on to the matter in hand.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This motion goes some way towards that.
The reality is of course entirely different.
Seventy-six countries now recognise the Sahrawi Democratic Republic.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 4 p.m.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I apologise.
Reports vary between 500 and 1500 people.
Â Â  .
He is creating his own version of the truth.
This is the true road to democracy.
Â Â  .
Are we leaving its inhabitants in the lurch?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 4 p.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Chinese said that he had two lawyers.
That has not happened.
There is no other option.
Â Â  .
This is not the case, however.
We must do more, however.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 4 p.m.
Â Â  Unfortunately, this is a recurring problem.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  The vote is closed.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
A slight amendment has been proposed.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr KuÅºmiuk.
It has spread throughout Europe.
What goes on via the Internet is disgusting.
They were not allowed to be named on television.
We protect them under the banner of individual rights.
It is time we protected children from paedophiles.
Your words were much appreciated.
Time is pressing.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs Stihler.
Mr Labouani is a symbolic figure in Syria.
He founded a liberal, secular party.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs De Keyser.
The situation is grim and it is urgent.
He married and had four children.
Part of the programme relates to public health.
I take pity on Europe and France.
There is no case for breaking these agreements.
A colleague spoke about it earlier.
You may do so directly if you wish.
I invite it to do so again.
Prohibitions and restrictions will not help.
Â Â  That concludes the one-minute speeches.
Â Â  MrÂ President, thank you very much.
Nor should Europe export social dumping.
Â Â  .
Society as a whole benefits from this.
It must also invest in people.
Â Â  .
Let me say something else about the WTO.
The WTO must become more democratic.
What do we get out of it?
What is going well in Europe?
What do we get out of it?
What do we get out of it?
Everything comes from China.
Is it not true that everything comes from China?
This is the reality.
How will we be able to address globalisation?
How can we safeguard viable pensions?
It is equal to an MEP's per diem.
Can we safeguard a viable European pension?
Can we safeguard work for all Europeans?
This is the reality.
What globalisation are we talking about?
What are the results?
What are we safeguarding for European citizens?
By exploiting people.
How can small retailers survive?
How can artisans survive?
Globalisation will seriously damage the future of Europe.
Â Â  .
I wish to give just one example of this.
Two weeks ago I was in Nairobi.
It is not just about trading blocs.
It is not just about economic returns.
The Lisbon process, which is a failure?
There are a number of definitions of globalisation.
That is the good thing about it.
What, then, of the ILO?
However, that is not enough by itself.
In my view, the keyword is ââ.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, globalisation is irreversible.
That is emphatically not the case.
No one.
Doing so at multilateral level is exemplary behaviour.
Europe also has to act as an example internally.
Europe provides an opportunity and a hope.
It will do no such thing!
It should be clear what is meant by this.
This need not necessarily involve new funds.
Clearly, something must be done.
We should put our money where our mouth is.
We cannot support calls for increasing the EU budget.
â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Globalisation must benefit everyone.
Â Â  .
Europe must not lag behind in this regard.
This will help prevent vertical bottlenecks.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Nonetheless, I see the following dimensions or problems:
The second dimension is the geographical dimension.
Does this not contradict the principle of technological neutrality?
What will happen in our schools and hospitals?
What will happen in old peopleâs homes?
That is a considerable advantage.
Schools, too, are in difficulties.
Our society has changed.
There are two points I should like to highlight.
The debate is closed.
The Commission will continue to monitor these allegations closely.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The precedents are not encouraging.
The EU did not offer to pay the difference.
Â Â  .
The debate is a first step.
Why?
Because this is an extremely important issue.
Commissioner Frattini, you are denying the obvious.
The Commission did nothing.
Further investigation is therefore needed into the matter.
This must not be allowed to happen.
Shall we allow them to do so?
This must be answered.
We expect genuine action and investigation.
And all without any support from the United States.
That strikes me as a very narrow interpretation.
Examples of such countries include Egypt and Thailand.
The law is unambiguous and binding.
Terror may not be fought with terror.
There is nothing problematic or uncertain about this issue.
That is not Europeâs way.
These are not radical newspapers or non-credible organisations.
You are not investigating it.
The end does not justify the means.
We must defend our values.
No, we do not.
No, we do not.
No, we do not have those powers.
That would require a change in the Treaties.
At present, we do not have these items.
I state that for the record.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This was a very disappointing result.
Where does that leave us now?
Â Â  .
That was our first setback.
I believe that this is another mistake, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  , .
Â Â  .
Here we go again.
I suggest two solutions.
Mr Barroso recently claimed that regulations might be cut.
After all, we are all grown-up democracies.
We owe these former colonies.
Thirdly, time is running out.
Â Â  .
We have not yet actually finalised this issue.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is not a âLamfalussyâ directive.
Therefore, the final responsibility lies with Member States.
The directive fulfils this objective.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Nevertheless, it is important to share best practice.
Â Â  .
It sounds rather unsavoury to me.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We will go ahead with our proposals.
Certainly I agree with these remarks.
The changes are often resisted by the same players.
Â Â  .
It is therefore demoralising on the inside.
And on the outside?
A great loss of credibility.
A scandal.
More of the same.
Very bad.
And the Member States?
Where is the British Presidency?
The Council spends 80%.
Where is the British Presidency?
This really is scandalous.
The Member States are happy.
They are pleased with themselves.
They are not even here.
That is obviously a good thing.
It is simply not good enough.
The first task was to explode myths.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mr President, here we go again.
My conscience is clear.
Is yours, I ask?
Enough said.
What I suggest is that you should be constructive.
It has made a lot of improvements.
That is simply not the case.
I have never come across one yet.
Â Â  .
Our report shows that considerable improvements have been achieved.
The Member States know about them too.
This is where we should start.
International comparisons show us in a very good light.
On the contrary, we want no such thing.
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
Who should be held responsible for this?
Â Â  .
The Commission has assumed its responsibilities.
These objectives remain pertinent.
What are the key actions for 2006?
First of all, action to bring about prosperity.
The second aspect relates to solidarity.
I agree.
In the European Union strong exports boost our growth.
We want the round to succeed.
Our commitment remains but now others have to move.
There must be balance.
It is time to stop lecturing and start negotiating.
So we have an interest in this round succeeding.
Tomorrow we will discuss the follow-up to Hampton Court.
The challenge is to make this enlarged Europe work.
The market alone is not enough.
Let us be frank.
We need a fair sharing of this burden.
No Member State can do enlargement on the cheap.
I hope it finds your active support.
Â Â  .
Quite the contrary.
Two aspects seem to be particularly important.
The first relates to demography and the ageing population.
How could we possibly function with annual budgets?
Â Â  .
That, too, is an absolute necessity.
Poland now has a completely new government.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
While the strange term sounds even worse.
Just a suggestion!
Instead we need something quite different.
We must choose peace, not war.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Drafting a legislative programme.
To deal with what?
It was drafting a legislative programme.
â MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, please refrain from commenting.
This is not reflected in this work programme.
The social dimension is very small.
Allow me to discuss a couple of these.
We have instruments at European level.
We have seen nothing of all this.
That too is conspicuous by its absence.
Please concentrate on civil justice.
The ânoâ votes should be respected.
Everything from the Constitution should be excluded.
We will follow it up very closely.
It is a strange document.
Colleagues were talking about priorities.
That is on pageÂ 27 of the document.
Why can we not see that in your programme?
People are not sufficiently aware of this.
The market cannot manage on its own.
Not solidarity, prosperity or security at any rate.
The main axis of its policy is communications policy.
In your oral presentation today, you said:
Good.
Agreed.
I am not taking powers away from you.
I await your response.
What has become of horizontal anti-discrimination legislation?
That is not the focus of our discussion now.
This work programme is part of that wider context.
Good European regulation cuts bureaucracy and red tape.
That point must also be made in this debate.
Certain proposals have not been retained by the Commission.
The Commission needs to provide an impetus.
This is not what is meant by simpler legislation.
These are the most important challenges.
There are three things I would like to mention.
The first is the Financial Perspective.
This work is now beginning.
Â Â  .
On this subject, we must be honest.
That is the European Commissionâs position.
We can have centres of academic excellence in Europe.
We are fully committed to this agenda.
We agree on that.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 14Â DecemberÂ 2005.
Â Â  Thank you, MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall keep this very brief.
Â Â  .
It could therefore be adopted at first reading.
Â Â  .
It concerns corporate social responsibility.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  We have voted against the three Daul reports.
True, they involve fewer alterations to existing regulations.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of it.
Â Â  .
This is indeed the case.
Â Â  .
What works best is not clear.
What is wanted is more research.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
That will be the day.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall be brief.
Hence our abstention from the final vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I fully support this report.
The impact of globalisation has positive and negative consequences.
This holds particularly true in situations like the exhibition.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
One has to do with substantive clarification of it.
The amendments also address many other individual issues.
The compromise package constitutes a balanced proposal.
Â Â  .
It acknowledges the concerns of industry and meets them.
Let me start at the beginning, with registration.
At the same time it must be proportionate.
I now turn to evaluation.
It is now tighter in our proposal.
It is clearer.
I look forward to the opinion from Parliament.
We believe we can.
Let me repeat, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Let us not throw it away.
I am particularly proud of this.
I am optimistic about this.
This is what we have done.
I therefore lend my backing to it.
Â Â  .
Ladies and gentlemen, uncertainty is very expensive.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The fact is that guaranteed mutuality is completely absent.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let us not spoil it.
Never.
This compromise only promotes ignorance and obscurity.
We cannot spoil it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
One thing still causes me concern.
Â Â  .
Chemistry is neither left-wing nor right-wing.
It is an indispensable element of the universe.
Humans are, nevertheless, mortal.
REACH needs, moreover, to be made clearer.
I should like to thank Commissioners Verheugen and Dimas.
We shall support the compromise proposals on the table.
That does not constitute your compromise.
You should, emphatically, listen to them.
We believe that this is wholly unacceptable.
What you are advocating is not an environmental policy.
You have lost credibility on environmental issues.
You are running away from your own proposal.
That is weakness, in my view.
You no longer have any credibility on environmental policy.
Finally, Sacconiâs apple.
Â Â  .
The Commissionâs REACH proposal must be improved.
Volume and risk go hand in hand.
That remains a major problem.
Â Â  .
REACH will encourage the replacement of most hazardous substances.
The key to this debate is balance.
Fifthly, repeated experiments on animals should be avoided.
The burden of proof must lie with the companies.
However, we cannot yet be certain.
We will have to watch that process like hawks.
A nightmare!
The two are directly connected.
The Council Presidency has made suggestions.
EU measures are thus justified.
I also support a strong substitution principle.
I am therefore able to support the compromise proposal.
That was the reason for bringing forward this proposal.
However, we do not know which is which.
Industry needs certainty and clarity.
Why is this?
What are the advantages of REACH?
I call upon you to support these amendments.
How is the product used?
How can it be identified?
Myself, I call that a defeat.
We all took up the challenge of Lisbon.
We are aware of the risks presented by chemicals.
A very great deal of harm has been caused.
We must therefore have a significantly more cautious approach.
The debate about REACH has been complicated.
They are everywhere.
They are in our clothes.
They are in our cars.
They are in the ball-point pen I am holding.
They are even in our childrenâs toys.
I urge you to support my amendments.
It also makes it less clear.
We cannot therefore support the compromise.
Â Â  .
REACH is a significant improvement on the status quo.
Europe has been debating REACH since 1998.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Mr President, I shall be very brief.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
These are Amendments 1 to 4.
This situation refers to a conception of multilevel intergovernmentalism.
Â Â  .
However, that is not in the Commission communication.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The number has grown enormously.
What of accountability?
The Commission is at least accountable to this Parliament.
We vote their budget.
It could at least correct some of the excesses.
It could provide for proper accountability.
It could have a standard structure.
We will not give up pursuing this matter.
Â Â  .
What should such a framework cover?
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Could you explain why?
Â Â  .
That would help to ensure compatibility with Treaty obligations.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The honourable Member has made a perfectly valid observation.
If so, what was the result?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I want to say two things.
Â Â  .
I can only offer you my good intentions.
Indeed, a number are already underway.
All that remains is to turn it into action.
Why not set aside this money for development?
Â Â  .
Nevertheless, work can be done at central level.
I shall give you the figures.
Â Â  .
I do not believe so.
We must simply bear in mind the progress made.
Trade is a matter of exclusive EU competence.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is very important.
Â Â  .
They are what we are required to do.
That is what I believe we are doing.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The investigation has made progress.
All that is in progress.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
However, the investigation continues.
Â Â  .
I should like to put the following supplementary question.
I very much agree.
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  .
It is a mixed picture, frankly.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
One of the criteria is absorption capacity.
We have to try hard to enthuse our citizens.
I hope that date is coming closer.
It is a joint challenge.
This applies to Turkey.
The practice towards human and minority rights?
The practice towards Cyprus.
I must nevertheless also consider what MrÂ Brok said.
Turkey does not belong to Europe and never will.
Â Â  .
I would certainly agree.
My second point concerns Kosovo.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  , .
We must go further as regards information.
This certainly sets a good precedent for the future.
Â Â  .
The Council attaches the highest priority to aviation safety.
Â Â  .
Europe is making progress towards increasing air safety.
It is taking great strides.
Â Â  .
This is a fine outcome.
Â Â  .
So the process was extremely positive.
I regard that as key.
Â Â  .
This is an absolute right.
I would like to express one reservation, however.
This EU action is both proportionate and appropriate.
There are times when the facts speak for themselves.
These circumstances demanded political debate.
Thank you, Mrs de Veyrac.
This is very important.
It achieves most of what the committee wanted.
These variations will mean that standards vary.
More and more people are flying.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
This text therefore goes a long way.
I understand the Councilâs reservations.
Â Â  .
It moves in the direction of effectiveness.
Â Â  .
Another issue mentioned was the European Aviation Safety Agency.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  .
This communication is incomplete, to put it mildly.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The third is combating energy dependency.
Â Â  .
We have to respect the vote on the budget.
Â Â  .
A potential problem will always cross state borders.
EU financing is needed for these.
Even reactor tanks may be exchanged in the future.
Their remaining life is therefore considered to be significant.
Detailed bureaucratic instructions for controlling this process are unnecessary.
In terms of how much money, though?
We are proposing EUR 400 million.
For cooling!
China is swallowing up the growth in oil production.
We need a new energy policy.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to summarise the situation.
Past mistakes are expensive.
Will we treat it as such?
European rules and standards need to be applied here.
Â Â  .
That is a fact.
Taxpayers?
Other citizens?
This really is a global challenge.
I agree entirely that the polluter should pay.
That element should be included in the price.
That is a very relevant issue.
I thank you very much for the debate tonight.
I am really pleased it was so detailed.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
That is unacceptable.
In this Chamber, that is particularly shocking.
Â Â  Thank you for that information, MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser.
Â Â  .
Dissatisfaction also threatens the election process.
The Iraq Government has specifically requested this.
The Council is considering how to respond.
Strengthening respect for human rights is also key.
Â Â  .
I truly meant it.
Today, the Iraqis have a constitution.
They will soon elect a constitutional government.
Inevitably, it crosses the path of regional cooperation.
Iraq will be a federal Iraq.
Inclusiveness is absolutely the only way forward.
We have supported the political process.
We want to be a meaningful partner for Iraq.
The Iraqis are looking forward to that.
We shall meet their expectations.
The first comment concerns the Commissioner's last sentence.
The second comment concerns the vote on the constitution.
The third comment concerns the elections.
It is the matter of security.
Â Â  .
It is no such thing.
That is a simple matter of justice.
Â Â  .
Nonetheless, Europeans have a number of serious concerns.
There are signs of widening instability in the region.
I have three specific concerns.
What kind of example are we setting?
Europeans disagreed on the rationale for going into Iraq.
Europe must work towards that goal.
Â Â  .
They are kept under appalling conditions.
Do you know what white phosphorus is?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What a contrast and what political progress!
Iraq is thus looking dangerously like another Afghanistan.
The situation as it is must now be faced.
An investigation must be carried out.
The majority of Sunnis are consciously outside political processes.
The consequences for peace and stability are obvious.
Â Â  .
The EU stands ready to offer further support.
We should not let Iraq down.
Â Â  .
We cannot continue looking backwards.
What would the alternative be?
What my colleague has just said is true.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The Kyoto Protocol has entered into force.
We also agreed a new partnership with India.
Â Â  .
The results are encouraging.
What are our objectives in Montreal?
We must, then, involve other actors.
We must establish long-term goals.
We must invest more in research and development.
That is quite incomprehensible to me.
The transport area is a very critical one.
There are, however, a great many obstacles.
The life-styles of all of us affect developments.
There is a lot to do in this area.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We simply use too much fossil energy.
Nice words are not enough, however.
Rail is five times more efficient than road transport.
Furthermore, it is environmentally friendly.
Â Â  .
Progress on the ground has been very disappointing.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I encourage other Member States to follow suit.
Temperature rises have already been noted.
The largest polluters include the European Union.
We certainly have something to celebrate in Montreal.
We need to do better and do more!
Renewable energy is the key plank of the solution.
It is a huge challenge.
We need excise regimes that favour bio-fuels and bio-flexi-fuels.
We need some radical thinking and radical action.
They are simple things which even we overlook.
This is a tragic truth.
We cannot put up barbed wire fences.
There is even a sense of urgency.
There is no one ideal solution.
I call on you not to hold it up.
How much money will be allocated to road-rail transport?
When will we have CAP appropriations for biofuels?
We are still only at the stage of intentions.
Let us move on to actions.
Even more important is the lifestyle.
The diagnosis has been made.
The United States must assume its responsibilities.
Our children and future generations expect nothing less.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines asked about the role of agriculture.
We will not act in this manner.
Â Â  .
They provide our guidance to decision-makers in society.
We need targets.
This is the difference between the two approaches.
We really should prepare for that impact.
We should not underestimate the size of the challenge.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12Â noon.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Nothing so far has happened.
There is no freedom of information in Tunisia.
European Union delegations are in Tunis right now.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That was decided long ago.
Â Â  â That concludes voting time.
Â Â  .
This proposal takes us in that direction.
Â Â  .
Co-operation and co-ordination is the key.
What is the spirit of this proposal?
I thank everybody for their support.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Citizens need to be informed and prepared.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted for this report.
All nuclear undertakings should have sufficient funds for decommissioning.
This report makes a contribution to that goal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our abstention.
The Wijkman report has a lot going for it.
Â Â  .I abstained from voting on this text.
More ambitious targets also need to be set.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .The climate is changing.
We will take the appropriate decisions on that basis.
Â Â  .
They felt detached from European politics and politicians.
First, there is research and development.
Second, there is investment in our universities.
The fourth concern was energy.
I do not call that an open market.
So we have some hard negotiating ahead of us.
Changes will be needed in three main areas.
This is not the case.
Standardisation and harmonisation do not add value by themselves.
Why not?
None of us wants to be poisoned by chemicals.
We have to recognise the difficult cases.
That cannot be right.
I believe that is quite right.
But the debate is far from finished.
Â Â  .
We must now move on with our work.
All the options must remain open.
As regards migration, work is already under way.
Finally, security confronts us with a two-fold challenge.
So there is a need for this European dimension.
Not at all.
But now I have to speak about money.
How can we keep our commitments to African peacekeeping?
We have to share the burden of this investment.
This is a win-win situation for all Member States.
We need a fair sharing of this burden.
No Member State can do enlargement on the cheap.
Hampton Court was indeed a success.
Â Â  .
That is what I regard as being our task.
Â Â  .
The President of Chile said so here last month.
Europeâs competitiveness is a constant concern.
Let us therefore stop being afraid of China.
Their citizens are saving record amounts.
It is budgetary resources that Europe sorely lacks.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Goebbels.
Efforts at reform are an exclusively national matter.
You mention the Court of Auditorsâ annual report.
I seek a clear answer from you.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  .
Why abandon this draft?
Â Â  .
It has become too large and divided.
The Informal Council was a wasted opportunity.
Europe needs direction on economic reform.
Europe needs direction on reforming the so-called social model.
Europe needs direction on being more flexible and responsive.
Europe also needs direction on its future financing.
Transparency and openness is another issue for the Presidency.
Mr Blair says he wants progress on this.
This really must be sorted out by the Presidency.
Those are positive benefits for our citizens.
No practical outcome, no progress, no perspective.
Yes, a common energy policy is obviously needed.
What we have heard today follows the same script.
This is a trend that must be reversed.
We have fallen short in the immigration challenge.
I think that is asking a lot.
Today, there is a vacuum.
That is no good at all.
I have looked at the statistics.
However, there are 58Â million of them.
Â Â  .
We all have responsibility for this.
Moreover, it is better to be flexible.
Why?
That is a fact.
That is the problem.
We are working through it.
That is the European Unionâs achievement.
UK Presidency: no progress.
Any other debate would be nothing but guesswork.
My colleague has just spoken for one minute.
No, I say, they are not.
Perhaps they have their priorities wrong.
Let me turn to the Financial Perspective.
We cannot have more Europe with less money.
The big question is how to do all this.
I am content with the outcome of Hampton Court.
It just carries on regardless.
There is no end to unhelpful legislation.
What is being done about all this?
The budget was mentioned.
Pretty fundamental, but still unresolved.
Apparently you want us to pay more.
Did you consider this at Hampton Court?
Â Â  .
MrsÂ BoboÅ¡Ã­kovÃ¡ spoke of the opportunities provided by globalisation.
Mr Zingaretti generously acknowledged the importance of Turkish accession.
For that I am grateful.
With that I would have no disagreement.
Â Â  .
Let us be frank.
However, we cannot do enlargement on the cheap.
And that is the point.
Are we ready?
Are we able to do it?
Can we deliver?
Of course it is not.
That is the great challenge.
I believe it is possible.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It has a young, educated and entrepreneurial population.
These are deeply troubling statements.
Let me turn first to those specific comments.
European Union Member States have agreed to co-sponsor it.
Â Â  .
Freedom of expression and association in Iran are eroding.
Â Â  .
We must be very vigilant where Iran is concerned.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is our way.
That is only the dialogue ...
He has talked about annihilating the State of Israel.
This wall must also be taken down.
Â Â  .
Such a threat demands the strongest possible response.
Â Â  .
Frankly it is clear what Iran must do.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  â Thank you Mr President.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
No Member States have ratified the convention.
Â Â  That is rather inadequate.
That is why they dislike the convention.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Only then may they distribute news or news analysis.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is unacceptable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Why, and for how long?
Why?
Will it be changed and when?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Can the Council reconcile these seemingly contradictory statements?
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you for your response.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I can be brief in answer to this question.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office.
We already know the British position.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, you were intrigued by the questioner.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
COREPER I will also feed into this process.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I wish to thank the Council for its answer.
I think that this is deeply inconsistent and immoral.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The scope of the proposed directive is truly restricted.
Â Â  .
That is also the reason for this international agreement.
So much for the historical review.
Â Â  .
I regard this as the right approach.
That is why we have rejected the Commission proposal.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I will do my best.
It appears that all parties had grievances.
Â Â  .
What are we to make of this?
We also do something about international animal transports.
This is all very important but also highly arbitrary.
Â Â  .
We can also endorse her arguments.
That is our question to the Commission.
Our political group concurs with the criticism made.
Â Â  .
This can have major consequences for public safety.
My second argument for rejection concerns the legal foundation.
The ban was intended to apply as of 1995.
The vote in committee produced a clear result.
The standards here are not humane.
The priority is for trapping to continue.
This article concerns the EUâs environmental policy.
I am of the opposite view.
Mr Maaten mentioned the Habitats Directive.
Fox farming is outright cruelty to animals.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
The figures are clear.
We Europeans therefore have a great responsibility.
It is weak and it is not legally binding.
Â Â  .
This is seen as a serious blow for multilateralism.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It advocates an international arms trade treaty.
The non-proliferation regime is seriously challenged.
The area is not new to the Commission.
A positive outcome to these negotiations is essential.
Let me now turn to defence procurement.
This would be neither quick nor easy.
It would require a new legislative proposal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Kristovskis report presents us with quite different issues.
Â Â  .
The rapporteur has done a sterling job.
Means must be linked to ends.
This is a fivefold increase on the 2003 figure.
Secondly, the heading is incorrect.
Constitutional restrictions remain however.
Arms are dangerous.
Arms are not toys.
The relevant approaches to this should be sought.
Tonight we have a dangerous mixture under discussion.
Now to come to the point.
The European taxpayer does not deserve this.
The answer is ânoâ.
What needs to be done, therefore?
Clear rules on defence procurement are therefore required.
Contracts must be transparent.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I shall now make a few specific remarks.
I say that specifically regarding the question on Colombia.
This is at the instigation of the British Presidency.
It is highly welcome.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
I should like to congratulate them.
and second, please raise your hands.
Please.
Here we go.
Good luck.
Â Â  We have noted your request.
Â Â  Granted, Mr Bonde.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  , .
Â Â  .
I hereby request an individual vote.
We have therefore taken the correct decision.
Thus the whole of the last sentence is deleted.
That, then, is my oral amendment.
Â Â  That concludes Question Time.
REACH should be a matter of common sense.
We do need to test chemicals.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Therefore I could not vote for it.
Â Â  Throughout the extensive voting the following principles were followed:
Â Â  .
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of this text.
Â Â  .
1.
2.
3.
4.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Long may it so remain.
Those days are over.
Â Â  .
I am pleased that these amendments passed.
We have antibiotics to show us that.
Hence my vote in favour.
Â Â  .
I support a strong substitution principle.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I voted for this Report.
Â Â  .
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed by the USA.
We are therefore voting against this report.
How much, then, is being produced?
The report leaves no room for doubt.
This is the arms race at its best.
Hence our vote against.
Not for much longer perhaps.
Let us reestablish Community preference and quickly.
Â Â  .
I welcome its proposals.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted for this resolution.
Has there been any threat of sanctions?
Not one.
No, thatâs not on the agenda.
Let us make things clear.
That is the reason why I abstained.
Â Â  .
This is no time for rhetoric.
That I regard as unworthy of this House.
Â Â  Here is the proposal from the President.
I must, however, make two observations.
This can only be applauded.
A new strategy is therefore needed.
Why not?
We cannot turn our backs on those people.
It is also a future demographic power.
One Europe: Europe has also changed.
They are entirely uncalled for in this instance.
What would become of the countries of Africa?
I should like to raise one point.
The timing of this report could not be better.
This is our support for democratic elections in Africa.
Such action does not come cheap.
How can we recommend such measures?
This reservation notwithstanding, I support the resolution.
We could debate this together.
It would be worthwhile.
I see that everyone agrees on this point.
This is not insignificant.
I think that we agree on the principle.
In conclusion, I assume so.
I have to be pragmatic.
The result?
I agree wholeheartedly.
He has considerable expertise on this subject.
I therefore share this point of view.
I have nothing to reply on this point.
The debate is closed.
That is not a credible way to act.
That is, of course, excellent.
Issues of harmonisation are being given prominence.
What is it all about?
Fourthly, it takes a rights-based approach.
That requires a solemn vote by Parliament.
Â Â  .
I am therefore not ideological.
I therefore cannot accept this criticism.
We are right to do so.
The discussions with the Council are still taking place.
I believe that progress has never stemmed from consensus .
Â Â  .
That is what the debate covers.
No, you are not going to trap me.
I will not fall into that trap.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
This human tragedy demands a compassionate response.
Perhaps some goodwill will come out of this tragedy.
Peopleâs lives depend upon it.
Hopefully this can be put into practice more.
Armed conflict still smoulders under the surface.
Kashmir is one of these cases.
There are now problems with Pakistan as well.
This House is no stranger to the Kashmir issue.
We have seen fund-raising, donations and practical assistance.
Their generosity of spirit sets us a challenge.
Perhaps there are some positive signs.
I should like to conclude with one final observation.
Â Â  .
It is a must for all of us.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
He was five centimetres too short.
The family did not recognise him and so on.
These are two entirely separate issues.
This is a different matter altogether.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Any form of dissidence is forbidden.
Some ethnic groups are, moreover, enslaved.
A lasting solution must be a political one.
We need a real ceasefire.
We currently have eight.
Perhaps.
Diplomatic pressure has demonstrably not worked against this regime.
Forced labour continues, despite agreements with the ILO.
Myanmar is currently subject to EU and UN sanctions.
Is that pie in the sky?
Â Â  .
Probably, the regime will deliver on its roadmap.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Therefore, that is a piece of nonsense.
I believe that this is quite clear.
Â Â  I read out your amendment in French.
MrÂ Posselt was perhaps not present.
We were here; we heard MrÂ Wijkman.
I shall give him the floor straight away.
I have already heard that and have clarified it.
Are there still speakers for and against?
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Despite that, she has been kidnapped.
This is quite simply an exponential rate of growth.
Sub-Saharan Africa is paying a very high price.
26Â million people are infected there.
That is not acceptable.
Â Â  .
That would then be a compromise.
Â Â  There is a specific proposal.
I must put the proposal to the vote.
I cannot now get into a conciliation procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, I am speaking under Rule 134.
Â Â  .
The global economy enjoyed a boost last year.
That has to be good for all member countries.
That is a great potential prize.
It is clear that we must resist this trend.
Â Â  .
Mr President, this is an important debate.
We are far from where we hoped to be.
Still others continued to frustrate the negotiation.
It began to rebalance the round.
We will reduce trade distorting subsidies by 70%.
We have to strike a balance.
Our offer is therefore substantial, measured and credible.
It has injected realism into the agricultural negotiations.
Let us therefore be very clear.
That is how multilateral negotiation works.
There have to be gains all round.
Of course we will.
But they must do something.
That is the principle of this round.
We also need progress in trade in services.
I will defend and explain Europeâs proposals.
I hope that they will do likewise.
I wish you and every success, Mr Mandelson.
Â Â  .
Should we search our own hearts?
I do not think so.
Â Â  .
Thirdly, I will mention agriculture.
Eight, social and environmental standards.
Â Â  .
That is how the plan seems to be evolving.
Â Â  .
Is that fair?
Is that a fair system?
It is not and cannot be!
How then will we feed the people of Europe?
The latter clearly cannot be happy about that.
My other point relates to prospective new members.
The WTO must carefully scrutinise the criteria being applied.
The offer is not perfect.
On that, Commissioner, we are with you.
The TRIPS Agreement needs to be reformed.
I really cannot believe that.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
These are the two main points of departure.
Europe and the world cannot afford any other outcome.
That is the major comment I wanted to make.
What kind of benchmarking is that?
Give them a chance at self-determination.
Why?
Does that also apply to the British Presidency?
That is quite enough.
Â Â  .
The results are enormously impressive.
That is what the EU package is about.
There are difficult issues in this trade round.
Â Â  .
There is also considerable public interest in this round.
The Uruguay Round made limited inroads into agricultural protection.
It must be balanced.
Mr DÃ©sir was right about agricultural liberalisation.
Of course agricultural liberalisation will benefit some developing countries.
We will not be proposing liberalisation of audiovisual services.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
We have a duty to respond to this concern.
Let me take Cambodia first.
We want to see real democratic development in Cambodia.
Frankly, that is not happening in Cambodia today.
I am pleased to report some tangible progress here.
Vietnam must end official harassment of non-recognised religious groups.
Â Â  .
It also explicitly prohibits forced renunciation of faith.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Of course, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Madam President, I welcome this debate.
These are not unreasonable requests to make.
All of these agreements have human rights clauses.
All is very far from well.
Much has certainly been done, but not enough.
I am glad to have this opportunity here today.
Their children receive no education and suffer from malnutrition.
The central government denies the facts.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
Everyone should be entitled to practise a sport.
The Commission might even consider freeing up some funding.
Â Â  .
This is implemented at three levels.
Â Â  .
I fully agree with Mrs Martens.
This is already the case.
Good luck Turin, with a truce and development!
Â Â  .
It is the wrong reflex at the wrong level.
Â Â  .
Sport is an excellent tool for this.
Greece therefore imposed the truce at that time.
We must therefore protect the Olympic Truce.
Â Â  .
Sports transcends all boundaries.
Europe is the centre of international sport.
I support this resolution.
All participants should be free to participate.
We must nurture and encourage this function of sport.
There you go.
Today the Olympic Games are showing their true value.
Today, this romantic idea now has weight.
The United Nations have approved it unanimously.
Leaders from all over the world have signed it.
Was this a romantic move?
Surely not for the children.
Romantic?
Only the Olympic Games managed it.
There is no reason why we should not.
It could happen and we should request it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am an unashamed sports fan.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
These are national, or even regional, issues.
That is totally unacceptable.
Perhaps there will be another occasion.
What then?
An attempt to board British merchant ships?
I think not.
Obviously there are serious safety issues here.
We clearly need to revisit the 1998 Manning Directive.
I find that accusation unacceptable and offensive.
I should therefore like to issue a warning.
What exactly has he achieved?
Nothing!
Â Â  I would not be at all surprised!
Everyone cannot therefore just engage in personal politics here.
We are complicating things, not facilitating them.
The matter is under negotiation.
Let us protect the institutions.
I repeat, who are legally employed.
Â Â  That concludes the item.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
Â Â  .
They are two separate issues.
This directive deals with animal health.
I will now turn to the amendments.
I shall try to speed up this process.
I hope that Parliament will support us in this.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I think that they have learnt a great deal.
Â Â  .
We are all happy to do this.
This is not a party political issue.
It is a great opportunity.
How are these diseases getting in?
We must look at that very closely.
Â Â  .
Sadly, that is how it is.
Clearly, these discrepancies are unacceptable.
What should we do during these few winter months?
Â Â  .
However, avian flu is not a new disease.
The threat to humans is not new either.
That pandemic killed approximately 50Â million people.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
And these are the worst enemies in similar situations.
We salute him for that.
There is no data available on this.
More can be done within the EU too.
Â Â  .
I would like to touch on a few issues.
There is still therefore a lot to be learned.
We do not discourage vaccination.
It can be used if certain precautions are taken.
We have had support in the past with Italy.
There is flexibility in this legislation.
The file has to be properly applied and monitored.
This is very important.
We have synergies and coordination.
There is clearly always room for improvement.
The systems worked and that is good.
The exchange of information and the communication also worked.
The Commission takes a different approach.
This has not protected them from the virus.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
This is a normal principle of law.
Â Â  .
There are many positive points.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Developing medicines costs money.
Â Â  .
The subject matter was difficult and complicated.
There just will not be any.
That must be made absolutely clear.
Â Â  .
That is the good news.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11Â a.m.
Â Â  .
Parliament needs to do so from its own perspective.
The democratic accountability of the Union is hereby strengthened.
I commend the report to the House.
This is unquestionably an important principle.
Â Â  .
That is very important.
It is something relatively new.
It was not in the original Treaties.
The hearings are not even mentioned in the Treaties.
We have built that up ourselves.
That gives extra flexibility.
The procedure has worked well.
It works.
I also welcome his comments.
They were slightly grudging at some points.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
We agree with the European Commissionâs analysis.
Â Â  .
This is a universal principle of law.
This type of solution would speed matters up greatly.
A useful precedent has been set.
The judgment mentions seven framework decisions, I believe.
Â Â  .
There are three methods that may be considered.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The current exemption is unique.
Participants in such a cartel may benefit.
Their customers most certainly do not.
And nor does the wider economy.
EU shipping lines are faring well.
What does abolition of conferences mean?
Service quality and innovation are likely to be improved.
We have the support of UNICE.
The liner industry itself is more divided.
Our concern is the competitiveness of EU industry.
Abolition of the conference system will bring significant opportunities.
Â Â  .
Is it already ready?
They also guarantee the diversity of operators.
The exchange of information could be rationalised.
We hope it will be heard.
Â Â  .
What businesses are we talking about then?
This strikes me as a misconception.
There is no free competition.
Today, things have changed.
Companies are merging or buying each other out.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
A few words about the future.
Â Â  .
Efficient operators and efficient markets should not be penalised.
That is not regularly enough.
Â Â  .
The report addresses five thematic areas.
I would like to mention some essential points.
This concerns international roaming in particular.
Therefore these are indisputable advantages.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
The services are therefore not cheap enough.
There are many examples of this.
Obviously, again, roaming costs should be reduced.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
My second report concerns VAT refunds.
This is the content of our amendments.
This would be the âleast worstâ solution.
Â Â  .
Businesses are very concerned as they need legal certainty.
Restaurant services are a very good example.
Some Member States press for more subsidiarity.
This is still the case.
However, there are some conditions.
It should not duck its responsibilities yet again.
Â Â  .
Anyway, everyone knows what is coming.
Â Â  .
Those are all elements that should be factored in.
Â Â  .
Today we are discussing a tax with pan-European significance.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Is this really what we want?
Taxes steer.
Is this madness?
An aberration?
No, this is simply what is taking place.
It has created jobs.
The experiment has also contributed to combating illegal work.
Plenty of words and no action.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you Mr President.
The Commission is proposing to extend it to 2010.
My own country never applied for reduced rates.
We need to do something here.
These are consultative-only as far as Parliament is concerned.
However, what is happening with legal bases?
We need certainty in our law.
Uncertain law is bad law.
Â Â  .
I shall briefly comment on some of the amendments.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11Â a.m.
Why have we ended up here?
Germany is opposed to this.
Is Germany wrong?
No.
Â Â  .
We have placed two important questions before the Commission.
Â Â  .
Police officers have a right to demonstrate too!
Â Â  .
Mr President, this is a two-spheres issue.
I thank the Commissioner for his offer.
Â Â  .
Have I understood that correctly?
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  .
That is a principle.
It is not a product for sale.
I hope the House will agree to that.
Â Â  .
This compromise is the result of hard work.
Â Â  .
The Commissioner was also supportive of this last night.
I would like to put that to the House.
The text reads as follows:
I propose that it should read as follows:
What is the justification for this?
It is a clarification point on TRIPs and TRIMs.
They are the wrong way round.
Â Â  That concludes voting time.
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  . Public health measures cost money.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
Hence our vote against.
We maintain our opposition in principle to the euro.
The lowest growth rate of the industrialised countries.
Unemployment.
Increased living costs.
Absurd budgetary constraints.
A dramatic rise in government debt.
A non-existent exchange policy and an overvalued euro.
It is imperative that they be consulted via referendum.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted for this report.
I therefore voted in favour of the Rosati report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
World trade is unequal.
It is unfair.
That is all that is at stakeÂ ...
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Independence for the Suze Valley, free Piedmont!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted for this resolution.
Parliament did not sanction the Santer Commission.
It is just a College of civil servants.
It grants the Commission absolutely no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the Kratsa report.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
That is the situation.
Thank you very much for your attention.
With this in mind, we endorse this request.
(1)
We feared the worst.
We were not wrong.
UEFA and MEPs are determined to stamp it out.
The European Union cannot develop further without solidarity.
I should therefore like a reaction from our institutions.
The political responsibilities in all of this are clear.
I would ask for your understanding.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Our Assembly is not a court.
MrsÂ Wallisâ report is balanced.
I hope that you succeed in doing this.
The European Parliament cannot do it for youÂ â¦
Â Â  .
I would also like to add a personal observation.
What hypocrisy and what lies!
We have spent long enough evaluating the facts.
We must therefore strongly condemn these remarks.
That is totally incorrect.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Rapporteur: Joahnnes Blokland (A6-0335/2005).
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Austria has achieved 40% collection afterÂ 14 years.
He has tabled many amendments supported by our group.
Be in no doubt about this.
Â Â  .
Let me conclude by considering the collection targets.
I have these two items with me today.
We support it.
I do not agree with an automatic ban.
I will support the common position.
The rules are already very strict.
The key to this success is shared responsibility.
I have tabled a fresh amendment to that effect.
MrsÂ Jackson quoted some figures.
She forgot about Luxembourg.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
I look forward to hearing your comments.
Â Â  .
What is this about?
Not everyone understands it.
Why do we want to extend them?
So what do we do now?
Why is this so?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The directive is an umbrella instrument.
We shall therefore vote in favour of the report.
This is not a prestige project or prestige fight.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I shall concentrate on that.
In addition, the practical situation has not changed.
Â Â  .
Let me refer to another issue.
Â Â  .
This is about citizensâ rights.
There are three elements that we need to achieve.
We do not want to see this again.
Â Â  .
A sustainable environment is not compatible with this model.
Â Â  .
Let me remind you of a few examples.
Such are the consequences.
We are therefore talking about a welcoming Country.
This is a breeding ground for large-scale corruption.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The right to property is a fundamental right.
This is totally unacceptable in a free society.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That will remain so throughout our mandate period.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What is good about this directive?
Â Â  .
These issues usually grab the headlines.
I shall mention just two examples that are encouraging.
They have avoided mentioning Europe.
However, we must not be complacent.
This directive is really necessary.
Only then will the consumer start to change.
We will not punish the countries that started earlier.
They could use this for achieving the target.
So, by doing, you learn something.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
There are two reasons in particular.
Fiscal matters are very problematic.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The report is ambitious.
Â Â  .
What causes the concern then?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It does not make sense.
My recommendation is leave it alone.
Because that will be the only way to calculate it
That is not the case.
It is good that we should have competition.
It is simply about accommodating the wishes of industry.
This is erroneous.
This assumption is open to question in my view.
Â Â  .
I should like to comment on the proposed amendments.
I will say no more at this stage.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We refuse to accept this.
It is true that inequalities tend to mount up.
We need to face the facts and condemn them.
In short, one disadvantage engenders another.
Let us have a common dream, Commissioner.
Unfortunately, I think the answer is no.
Â Â  .
First, there is the budget.
The second issue is decentralised implementation.
I am looking forward to a positive answer.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Therefore we need action, not words.
I propose that the report be accepted.
Â Â  .
This will be a key factor in its success.
We can accept the increased references to gender mainstreaming.
These went very quickly and were very rewarding.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
I am the only one left here.
However, we welcome the âvelvet revolutionâ.
We recognise that the Georgians need increased help.
(1)
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
The outcome speaks for itself.
Â Â  .
In the end, none of that happened.
Â Â  .
But it does something more than that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Our Parliament wants to represent Europeans.
It wants us to be united in diversity.
There are no good arguments for it.
We want a more social and less military Europe.
The facts are as follows.
The competitiveness of EU businesses is declining.
Solidarity is a basic concern for these latter.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a poor budget.
I say this not only because it is small.
Third time lucky, we hope.
These are currently clearly lacking.
That goes for Parliament too.
Thirdly, a word on headingÂ 4.
We have a knee-jerk reaction to major disasters.
We have commitments to the MDG global health funds.
We do not, however, have adequate resources.
Let this be a priority for the Council Presidency.
This budget shows the way.
This is what differentiates us from the Council.
The Council sticks up for the Member States.
This is the essence of the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I wish Parliament a successful vote on Thursday.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
This research is the key to our future jobs.
Â Â  .
All these developments we regard with concern.
That is the only thing we demand of him.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let me say a few words about the process.
We continue to pay full attention to social issues.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Under that condition, we withdraw the oral amendment.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to ask for clarification.
Â Â  .
It will also assist debt recovery.
Â Â  Your question speaks for itself, Mr Evans.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
We have thus voted against the reports.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .âEqual opportunities for all.
Towards a just society.â
Who would dare speak out against such a report?
What a departure!
Â Â  . This proposal warrants our agreement.
Enlargement contributes to this positive development.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Heavy metal emissions are one such issue.
Â Â  .
Nickel-cadmium batteries are particularly polluting.
This is my interpretation of the outcome.
There is a risk of excessive bureaucracy.
Nevertheless, it places the accent on free competition.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .The proposed procedure reveals some significant legal shortcomings.
The procedure takes place in two stages:
1.
2.
In return:
Â Â  .
It is disgraceful.
Â Â  You have had one minute, Mr Gollnisch.
These explanations of vote are for one minute only.
This is not the , Mr Gollnisch.
It is the European Parliament.
The floor now goes to Mr Vanhecke.
They were improperly and scandalously taken out of context.
These crimes are nevertheless historical facts.
To deny or to dispute this is a crime.
This point refers to .
It is not a question here of simple guesswork.
We are voting against this report.
Â Â  .
We therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Is that our vision for Europe?
That is not my vision for Europe.
Fiscal flexibility is paramount to improving European competitiveness.
Let us not forget that tax is another.
And tax competition is healthy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have agreed a European Union counter-terrorism strategy.
We have adopted a money-laundering directive.
This is a very substantial range of achievements.
That is why today is so important.
There should not be overall access.
The Council gives its support.
Â Â  .
What an interesting idea!
That was our problem.
We have reduced the requirements.
Legislate honestly.
Do not create new problems of competition in Europe.
The measure proposed would not prevent terrorism.
A constitutional crisis could arise.
Retain the right to privacy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Registration of that nature would therefore be rather pointless.
My group will therefore simply vote against the proposal.
Â Â  .
You are elected by the people to defend democracy.
That is what they are asking of us.
Shall we do so?
It might still be doing the same.
We must not allow it.
The final recipient will be the CIA.
Long live freedom!
The debates on this report have been very difficult.
They are ineffective because they are easy to circumvent.
We have not been given an answer.
Is this remedy not worse than the disease?
There is no control over that.
We did our best in the circumstances.
Neither can do without its freedom.
It is abolishing the core of confidentiality of communications.
It is safeguarding and introducing legislation imposing across-the-board monitoring.
Security over freedom, no.
The victims deserve all of our efforts.
My party, PASOK, will be voting against.
This is not personal, this is political.
It is shame that we missed this opportunity.
The British Government has GCHQ in Cheltenham.
I hope this Parliament will reject it.
This compromise is one that I can support.
We must not choose between security and freedom.
There can be no freedom without security.
Freedom and security are part of democracy.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am not neutral.
I am passionately in favour of human rights.
Nevertheless, I wish to make three brief points.
The first concerns the balance between freedom and security.
Perhaps we are rushing things.
My second point concerns cost-efficiency or efficiency in general.
I do not think we have done that yet.
My third and final point concerns procedure.
It was a good compromise.
I disagree.
I will give you a practical example.
It is indisputable that this directive is intrusive.
It is questionable whether it will help.
I fear a false sense of security.
Firstly, human rights must be upheld.
Personal data protection must be guaranteed in all circumstances.
These are targets we can probably all agree with.
We have protected personal privacy and human rights.
We must succeed in these areas together.
I am against this proposal.
However, in electronic communications the frontiers are artificial.
That is not a perspective that I share.
I should still like to make two final considerations.
Â Â  .
Secondly, these proposals are about networks.
It is very important to understand that.
Those are the procedures and that also is clear.
This is the opposite of a police state.
This proposal goes in exactly the opposite direction.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Madam President, the Presidency warmly welcomes this debate.
There were a number of innovations in 2005.
Events have obviously moved on since then.
Â Â  .
That gives valuable credit to the report.
Let me briefly touch upon some of these items.
I have six points to make.
Still, much has to be done.
Our colleague has already mentioned some very concrete issues.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I hope we will hear from her too.
Tunisia is a country closely associated with the EU.
Nor is such dialogue making any progress in Russia.
Â Â  .
Every year, it executes thousands of people.
We have not received any response.
What has happened about GuantÃ¡namo?
What action has it taken?
I could mention other cases.
We are still awaiting many replies.
Words are not enough; we need action.
As a result the dialogue was suspended.
Discrimination against minorities and members of other religions continues.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This instrument is allocated EURÂ 13Â million.
The Neighbourhood Policy is my specific responsibility.
I think this is important.
Human rights are valid in every situation.
We know that this is a difficult challenge.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
A court decision in September 2005 postponed its Congress.
Under its Constitution, it is independent.
Â Â  .
Governments have political responsibilities to fulfil.
These demarches represent our first steps.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Why Tunisia?
The answer is simple.
Secondly, Tunisia is a model of Mediterranean cooperation.
That is a major achievement.
It was unnecessary and took the shine off it.
It was a pleasure to watch her.
That was a serious matter.
We all know that Tunisia has a secure constitution.
The case of Tunisia is not just any case.
And to me this is the fundamental aspect.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Why is this directive necessary?
Quite simply because of multimedia convergence.
What do I mean by âlight-touchâ?
Then there is the protection of human dignity.
The first of these rules is the twelve-minute limit.
This is very important.
Â Â  .
The linear and non-linear division is fairly clear.
I shall give you a very simple example.
This is a question for us to discuss.
Children, unlike adults, are defenceless against this.
My questions today relate to just two issues.
Could she elaborate on this for us?
Are there any implications as regards financial aid?
I should like to comment on certain points.
But that is not true.
Where should the boundaries be drawn?
Are they able to advertise such services?
What about health magazines?
Â Â  Mr President, I repeat my question.
I am on the list of speakers.
Â Â  I did hear you.
Commissioner, the floor is yours.
MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner mentioned advertising during childrenâs programmes.
I wish to protect children in particular.
MrsÂ TrÃ¼pel spoke about editorial independence.
Consequently, health information is included in this definition.
That concludes this item.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission:
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That cannot be right.
Â Â  .
I was not at the meeting.
I wonder whether you have obeyed those rules.
Â Â  .
But I repeat that I was not influenced.
Â Â  .
That is what happened in this case.
I was not asking the Commission for support.
Â Â  .
That is normal project management practice.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Urban transport has become a major problem.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
What is this 'delivery', Commissioner?
Â Â  .
Let us not tempt fate.
Let us work in order to solve these problems.
Â Â  .
I ask because the region is extremely isolated.
Â Â  .
I thank the honourable Member for this important question.
We are applying the Rules of Procedure strictly.
Â Â  .
The situation is naturally attractive to counterfeiters.
I thank you for your reply and your interest.
Â Â  .
That, therefore, concludes Question Time.
Â Â  .
I should like to single out two of them.
My warmest congratulations to you, Madam.
The present directive is both restrictive and ineffective.
Â Â  .
I know that this is also true for Parliament.
Â Â  .
I am much obliged to MrsÂ Wortmann-Kool.
I am also much obliged to Commission Vice-PresidentÂ Barrot.
I am also much obliged to the British Presidency.
At that time, we received pitying smiles.
Now, the day has come.
Â Â  .
This constitutes a real gain in quality.
Â Â  .
Tolls are a hot issue.
Â Â  .
Switzerland is a good example in this respect.
The most polluting trucks are exempt until 2010.
Â Â  .
I shall therefore vote against the proposal.
This goes way beyond its remit.
This is only the thin end of the wedge.
I fundamentally oppose such measures.
I should like to discuss two important points.
Unfair competition is not being ended, but reinforced.
One question remains, however.
Yet no such guarantee has been given.
It would only finance other modes of transport occasionally.
That is unacceptable.
This directive is of key significance for road hauliers.
We thank him in particular.
It will do this over the next two years.
That is the word I will use.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I congratulate all concerned.
Â Â  .
However, the reality can be very different.
Many airlines have made improvements under a voluntary agreement.
It will put an end to abuse and discrimination.
Â Â  .
We knew of and were familiar with these difficulties.
I should like to thank my colleague MrÂ Evans.
Madam President, I have two more brief remarks.
It does, however, permit certain exceptions.
Â Â  .
The amendments proposed enhance the Commissionâs objectives.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
There are several places where intervention is possible.
This can be explained in a number of ways.
Â Â  .
This is a fact.
But there will always be room for improvement.
This is even truer for new Member States.
We have a more demanding situation now.
There are very interesting suggestions in the report.
We give priority to calls for specific projects.
I shall conclude by making two points.
We have circulated a questionnaire.
I will stop there.
I apologise if I have spoken for too long.
Â Â  Commissioner, you do not have to apologise.
You were very precise and it was very interesting.
Consumer protection and the internal market are intrinsically linked.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That applies to financing too.
On training, we can train the trainers.
With regard to education, I agree.
It was very well received.
I have figures from the new Member States.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
Social and environmental mitigation measures are also included.
The Commission welcomes the amendments proposed in his report.
Substantial additional funding will be provided from 2007 onwards.
Â Â  .
I myself have visited Guyana and various other countries.
Â Â  .
Let us not play Robin Hood in reverse.
Let us find new money to aid these countries.
Â Â  .
Sugar cane can even be used as cattle fodder.
Â Â  .
Only EURÂ 40Â million is on the table.
The ACP countries call it peanuts.
We must avoid robbing Peter to pay Paul.
Â Â  .
Let us hope things will progress well.
Mrs McAvan made some very inspiring remarks.
However, that is the amount available.
What happens after 2006?
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
This should have happened earlier.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The first of these is the relocation of businesses.
I hope that we can continue in that manner.
Money should be returned in the event of non-compliance.
Â Â  .
This is unfair.
Fear not, Commissioner.
Fear not, Commissioner.
Fear not, Commissioner.
She knows that, we know that.
Small businessmen need to be flexible.
State aid is an important tool in regional development.
I support the drive towards such reforms.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
I hope it will be here later.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Watson.
Â Â  .
We all know what is at stake this week.
The Commission has set out its ideas.
Parliament has done the same.
Now we are waiting for the Council.
Policies delayed are policies denied.
The Commission is playing its role.
We need an ambitious Europe.
But we must be coherent.
It needs action.
And action needs means and instruments.
There is another direct consequence of a tight budget.
I remain convinced of that.
That will be crucial to reaching an agreement.
This creates a very unfortunate effect.
We need to ensure the coherence of our instruments.
I welcome Parliamentâs position.
But we must do that with confidence and ambition.
Â Â  .
But Europe has responded.
Secondly, there is the issue of economic reform.
They have no place in civilised political debate.
I hope that it will receive your support.
Â Â  .
I hope that it will.
Â Â  .
That was this European Parliament in action.
They, too, said, âWhat?
The British proposal gives it 44%.
The symbol was, of course, the .
Today, we are on the .
Certainly not 1.03%.
That is the centre of the iceberg.
Choose another route and do it urgently.
Mr Alexander, that is what I wish.
Then you will have a successful British Presidency.
Otherwise we will fail altogether in Europe.
Â Â  .
What about money for challenges, such as security?
What about the ambitions of the Lisbon Agenda?
This is not just a budget for tomorrow.
The Presidency has ambitions for a wider Council agenda.
I wish you success.
Â Â  .
I find that very, very interesting.
Nuclear energy!
Do not stay in the 1960s.
Modernity means something else, namely hydrogen.
This finance ministerâs aspirations are a scandal!
Fighting against terrorism cannot mean fighting against democracy.
Do you understand?
It cannot mean fighting against democracy.
We must stop the wrong fight against terrorism.
Â Â  .
MrÂ Blair leapt unrestrainedly into the breach.
We will soon see who really wants Europe.
I have a positive proposal for all of you.
Yes, honestly!
We are always holding you up.
We are always stopping you.
Get rid of us!
Kick us out!
Expel us!
Minister, you mentioned terrorism.
He knows the British Presidency has been a disaster.
We do not subscribe to your project.
Today we know this emperor has no clothes.
This is not a parliamentary democracy.
That was never intended.
Mr Putin would feel perfectly at home.
So we should!
It began with high hopes and prime ministerial panache.
In June, he said the rebate would remain.
Will that be a vain hope?
But then the cuts will come, as always.
Do you want us to return to national contributions?
We cannot consent to an EU of this kind.
Thank you.
The results of that policy have been extraordinary.
It was you who spoke of a realistic Budget.
That leads me on to the issue of enlargement.
That is why I find your proposal incomprehensible.
We expect you to deliver a balanced outcome.
The ball lies in your court.
We also took part in a number of seminars.
Christmas is coming.
This amounts to a figure of EURÂ 6Â billion.
The European Parliament cannot consent to such a vision.
I was wrong.
We do not want charity.
We are not beggars.
We want our money back.
Limiting that support today means breaking the contract.
That is blackmail.
Your mentality is one that I cannot fathom.
In addition, farmers are being discussed.
We had to be disappointed.
We have already managed to successfully avoid it once.
The problem is that we are moving in reverse.
This is unacceptable, humiliating and inadmissible.
This is not worthy of Europe.
The governments need to change their approach.
They should follow the European Parliament!
Â Â  .
Mr President, I always enjoy these debates.
We tabled an options paper last month.
We believe that is transparently and eminently fair.
This is no zero-sum game.
Â Â  Colleagues, please be quiet.
Our debate is not yet over.
Â Â  .
We sincerely hope for more.
How can this be achieved?
That is the problem.
President-in-Office, you mentioned the world trade talks.
Why?
It is not just about the financial perspective.
I think not â that is not fair.
I believe a deal is possible.
It is difficult but it is possible.
The first point is a higher level of spending.
I believe a deal is important.
Because without solidarity there is no Union.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
Behold the unmasked EU!
Congratulations, Mr President.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Their representatives came instead of them.
The fight against inhuman laws.
They are well known to us.
Mrs Hauwa Ibrahim:
We admire your determination.
We admire your personal commitment.
There can be no democracy without pluralist information.
Without it there can be no democracy.
In 2004 that figure was 53.
Unfortunately, it is increasing.
Because dictatorships do not last forever.
Two intellectuals separated by many years.
Voltaire and Brecht are watching us.
Thank you very much.
Mrs Blanca Reyes, you have the floor.
Â Â  â.
Your strength makes you worthy of this recognition.
Vaclav Havelâ.
Havana, 14 December 2005.
We are very grateful for this opportunity.
Let me turn now to our strategy.
We were focused and we stayed focused.
We do not know.
That is what we knew.
We acted locally, but we thought globally.
We told them what we wanted them to know.
I will share with you today our safety strategy.
We never dress the same way twice.
They said I was anti-Sharia and anti-Islam.
I was afraid, of course.
You heard what they said on the radioâ.
There were eight mullahs.
I did not sit on the chair.
I walked towards them.
Sit on that chairâ.
And I said: âI am.
But I am a foolish lawyer.
I am a stupid lawyer.
I did not know what I was doing.
I came to you because I want some knowledge.
I caught their attention.
And that was all I needed.
Nothing more.
We needed safety.
We needed them to listen to us.
We needed to carry them along with us.
We needed to engage them.
This is part of the strategy.
And that is my passion.
Now I shall read my three-minute speech!
They are illiterate and poor.
We need you to help us with your voice.
It has to be reformed.
Our goal for the reform is a bottom-top approach.
Our methodology will be flexible.
Thank you so much.
Â Â  .
Thank you, Jean-Marie.
That is not my problem.
That is all!
How unfair for the others, though.
That is not democracy, however.
No, they are not the same thing.
We have to fight in these two different cases.
We do in fact live in democracies.
Democracies exist.
It is a despicable thing to do to them.
Yes, we need to reflect.
That is happily not the case.
What is delaying this association agreement from being implemented?
We need you, you know.
We rely on your doing so.
Speak the truth.
That is the only thing we ask of you.
We have had enough of people waxing lyrical.
We have heard enough quivering voices.
I wanted to make yet another final point.
This injustice is unacceptable.
Do you know what is good about human rights?
The fact that it works.
I am not saving my soul.
To do that, we need you.
In the United States, the police quick-freeze data.
Where were you on 17 March?
Whom did you meet?
Whom did you sit beside?
Did you sit beside a known criminal?
How can you prove that you had no contact?
The Greens voted against this directive.
For these reasons I have voted âNoâ.
It is also ineffective.
Â Â  .
I welcome the proposed agreement between Parliament and Council.
Why do they think that?
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
I voted against the proposal on Data Retention.
Mass surveillance threatens that confidence.
Â Â  .
This is an approach we owe Europeans.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hurried law is usually bad law.
It has many defects.
The question of costs is unclear.
The inclusion of emails was badly thought through.
The industry was never formally consulted.
Hotmail and Yahoo emails are excluded.
So much "Spam" email is sent.
Why do the governments want to preserve spam ?
This is an unsatisfactory law.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is an approach we politicians owe Europeans.
Â Â  .
Europe has faced terrorism for many years.
Modern terrorism means mass-casualty attacks.
Torture is abhorrent.
The prohibition against it is absolute.
The Council welcomes this statement.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  You wicked girl!
Â Â  .
That is something I should like to know.
No, indeed not.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I see we have some Americans in the Chamber!
Where were they detained?
What was their status?
Nevertheless, I would ask you not to wait.
What is it about these other countries?
What information have they had from their secret service?
What are all the other European countries doing?
This is not the truth.
Serious human rights issues are at stake.
The story does not stand up to scrutiny.
A dangerous trend can be observed in Europe.
We have a right to know the truth.
Â Â  .
They are a reality with which we live.
The prohibition against torture is absolute.
Indeed, we condemn it.
These are not just words.
The truth needs to be ascertained everywhere.
That will be my personal commitment.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 10.00.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
Their accession is already secured.
I am sure the Commissioner will confirm this.
They are making an increased effort.
I commend my report to Parliament.
Â Â  .
The safeguard clause is not just a gadget.
Then there is the issue of minorities.
Â Â  .
Much has happened in the past year.
Â Â  .
Living conditions and economic opportunities have improved.
However, shortcomings remain in other areas.
Romania has made substantial progress to reach this stage.
I clearly acknowledge that before this Parliament today.
Â Â  .
There is a fundamental coincidence between the two reports.
We want to be closely involved in this issue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The debate on this will be held in mid-2006.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Our amendment stresses that fact.
In other fields the situation is worsening.
The trafficking of children has doubled.
This initiative deserves our support.
I think this is a sad day for Parliament.
The reports pass over this issue.
It simply makes it the last permanent solution.
Will new people with new insights fill important positions?
They are going to be welcomed in anyway.
Please allow me to give an example.
This constitutes further evidence of the Romanian political window-dressing.
Why is this the case?
That is not the Europe I know.
It is important that we remember this.
That would be a wonderful symbol.
We need to address it.
I share the concerns of colleagues.
We represent their best hope.
Â Â  .
Corruption in international adoption has been clearly a problem.
I do not accept either charge.
Â Â  .
The coming months will be decisive for both countries.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
We will take the following questions to the Council.
Â Â  .
Â Â  President-in-Office, thank you for that reply.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Preparations should have been made in 2005.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The public is entitled to some joined-up thinking.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That single seat is Strasbourg.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There is no single European social model.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This includes common policies.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It would send a negative message about multilateral cooperation.
Well done!
There is a world of a difference.
Who gains?
Because not everyone gains equally.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
Â Â  .
Â Â  This is a very serious issue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We would be delighted to welcome him there.
Â Â  .
17 Member States have no such legislation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â Thank you for that very succinct answer.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
During our Presidency we have maintained that position.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Question Time is closed.
Â Â  .
The first declaration reads:
Â Â  .
We have achieved all these goals.
This is very much to be welcomed.
This is a real shame.
That was eighteen months ago.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  .
That focus has been lost.
Commissioner, thank you for listening.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We still have a long way to go.
We eagerly await the conference scheduled for 2006.
There is still a lot to do, however.
A more exhaustive report must be produced.
The training that the Commissioner mentioned is needed.
I am also indebted to the Commissioner.
Why is that so important?
Women often trade in, and buy, fish.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  .
The Commission has difficulty in accepting AmendmentÂ 13.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Maintaining employment is a specific objective that nobody questions.
Value for money for the third country?
Â Â  .
Yet no such increase is forthcoming.
Â Â  .
Just so.
Everyone must be on an equal footing within Europe.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This can be done through a budgetary arrangement.
This amendment cannot, therefore, be accepted.
It cannot, therefore, accept this amendment.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There must be proportionality.
Think what that does to competitiveness.
That would greatly help.
This is unacceptable and unworkable.
You talked about a level playing field.
It does not exist.
There should be proportionality and equal treatment.
I realise that there is no easy solution.
Let me make it clear.
I believe we require sanctions and controls.
I want to put one question to the Commission.
You said you were going to harmonise sanctions.
Â Â  .
They are less expensive than judicial proceedings.
Â Â  â The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  .
The Seychelles authorities have shown great understanding.
The Protocol is of mutual benefit to both parties.
I shall now turn to the amendments.
Therefore I am unable to accept this amendment.
AmendmentÂ 4 cannot be accepted by the Commission.
It is European taxpayersâ money that is involved.
Please, Commissioner, think again about those amendments.
Â Â  .
What are we doing here?
This situation is intolerable.
We have to ensure that this never happens again.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Alright, that concludes the vote.
But the Minister is not here yet.
Please be courteous towards the British Presidency.
I rise under the precedent of Rule 145.
I beg the Houseâs indulgence.
Â Â  .
So I genuinely apologise for that misunderstanding.
Â Â  .
It is a tremendous vote in favour.
Â Â  .
There has been a misunderstanding.
It should not be there.
It is an important oral amendment.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the explanations of vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The wording is also fairly unclear.
Â Â  .
In 2005, France paid EUR 16.7Â billion.
1.
2.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We voted in favour of this initiative.
This also holds true when they travel by air.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is the least we can do.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The figures speak for themselves.
This amount is obscene.
Â Â  .
The fisheries policy also has devastating global consequences.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is why I support this report unreservedly.
Hopefully that is not just pie in the sky.
We therefore opted to abstain.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Aid to Georgia
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
- Human rights in Tunisia (RC-B6-0646/2005)
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have to allow this to continue.
- EU development policy (RC-B6-0653/2005)
Â Â  .
The response to this could hardly have been clearer.
That is the cornerstone of our civilisation.
We must not let terrorism destroy our basic values!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It does not stop there, however.
We therefore opted to abstain.
Â Â  .
We have thus chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
However, we have a problem.
Â Â  .
We hear they have also been tortured in detention.
But what is their crime?
The Chinese Government is attempting to brainwash the people.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  , .
Â Â  , .
There is a lack of democracy in both cases.
Tibet has been brutally occupied by China since 1950.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It also goes against international law.
It can show that changes can be made.
Obviously we hope that that will be the case.
Â Â  .
Lebedev is seriously ill.
Â Â  .
Such an issue is that of NGO legislation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I hope reason prevails.
Â Â  ,.
The resolution before us deserves our overwhelming support.
Indeed, it is all in our back yard.
It concerns us all.
Â Â  â Thank you Mr President.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
Let me begin with Chechnya.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
What message are they sending to all Africans?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
All around it, the situation is precarious.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Nor is condemnation of these violations new.
Reports get worse and worse.
It will need to be a very big field.
Â Â  .
The democratisation process has come to a difficult crossroads.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Phillip was highly respected across this House.
Dear Phillip, we will all miss you.
Several have attempted suicide.
Awareness is, after all, dependent on information.
This should not be the case.
It is unimaginable.
I hope the Austrian Presidency will do as well.
The Greek government is reviewing the Constitution.
This is clearly a slight.
We therefore want the right to democracy.
We want the right of coexistence.
Everyone must heed what the United Nations says.
Â Â  Naturally I have been elected from a Spanish list.
Yet something odd is going on within the Commission.
Two French policemen have been seriously injured today.
I rose to speak about another issue, however.
Â Â  Mr Czarnecki, we shall examine your proposal.
That concludes this item.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
A lot of pressure needs to be applied.
We must get rid of that.
Â Â  .
What have the victims of these vile acts done?
Nothing.
We need to be vigilant on a daily basis.
The Europe of 25 means fraternity and equality.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
The fundamental rights are not a matter of subsidiarity.
Â Â  .
I have read up on this speech once again.
It will act as a political driving force.
Take the Liberals.
The rights of homosexuals must be defended wherever possible.
No minority may be discriminated against in this regard.
This is about equality, not about promoting homosexuality.
I am gay.
Why?
A judgement has been made on it.
Where is the morality in that?
Of course he killed others too.
The Buttiglione case is still fresh in the memory.
You either protect human rights or you do not.
Transparent information is indeed a priority.
That too has been done, ladies and gentlemen!
The debate is closed.
It is a very brief question.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
Â Â  .
I hope that this will happen.
We cannot ignore this.
Answer for yourselves.
Â Â  .
I will mention five of them.
Â Â  .
It involves all of us.
I therefore welcome this report.
Â Â  .
This exemption is not being respected.
Citizenship belongs to nation states.
No European law is needed for that.
For example, EU citizenship is impossible to renounce.
I do not want it.
This report proves that beyond doubt.
This clearly runs counter to the Treaty.
There cannot be first- and second-class Europeans.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at noon.
Â Â  .
Something of a rethink is called for here.
No one can fail to notice their tragic circumstances.
The current degree of harmonisation is limited.
They also need help to rejoin society!
Â Â  .
I therefore hope that the points raised are upheld.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am in favour of criminalising demand.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This gives rise to frustration and various social ills.
That is not what I am discussing.
Who is to blame?
There is no room for compromise or indifference.
It was surely inevitable.
We need a clear legal basis.
I concur with that 100%.
It is clear that these facts are connected.
Should we grant them this right without limits?
Â Â  Madam President,
We must continue in this direction.
This crime is developing across borders.
More effort is therefore desperately needed.
Women and children are the victims.
I agree on taking a tougher attitude towards customers.
That shows that Europe can and must take action.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
Â Â  .
We shall be constantly and vigilantly following this issue.
Â Â  .
I want to do that.
That is not a negligible achievement.
This has to be minimised.
We will be very vigilant on this.
We should not abandon that principle.
I really hope this is the case.
That remains the aim of this round.
Reducing barriers to trade drives economic growth.
In trade negotiations you get what you pay for.
These are my preliminary thoughts.
This effort unites us.
It is a common challenge.
Â Â  .
Much remains to be done.
Â Â  .
It certainly delivered on this.
And push we must.
We can do good.
We should now use that stage as a springboard.
Now is the time to be ambitious again.
Let the EU lead and hope others follow.
Â Â  .
What next, then, for the negotiations?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Secondly, Hong Kong validates Seattle and Cancun.
I hope you will take that message back.
Should we not look at a less circus-like approach?
Perhaps you could find something to say about that.
My fourth point has to do with standards.
What line do you take on research into bioethanol?
This is no zero-sum game.
I detect two worrying reactions.
That would be a big mistake.
What a disappointment!
Â Â  Mr President, I thank the Commissioner.
I should like to begin with a few positives.
Those are positives.
Those are essential.
It is a formidable list.
Can you do it by 30Â April, Commissioner?
Some difficult negotiations are awaiting the Commission this spring.
Trade is only the outcome of economic activity.
Has it been a complete failure?
No.
Has it been a complete success?
No.
What role has the European Union played?
Talks and negotiations are continuing.
They are complex.
One such example is the impact on employment.
Parliament will be debating that later this week.
This is an important point.
Â Â  .
I cannot do them all justice.
That is their choice.
In my view that is very important.
In my view GIs are of vital interest.
Why?
Because multilateralism is important.
Multilateral processes and institutions are important.
I am not ignoring the bilateral agenda.
Â Â  I must close this very long debate.
We are out of time.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Our constant contacts and cooperation in Montreal bore fruit.
The Adaptation Fund will finance adaptation activities.
The Clean Development Mechanism was strengthened.
The joint implementation bodies were also set up.
The Montreal conference ratified this approach.
The period of inquiry is over.
However, we cannot rest on our laurels.
Climate change requires urgent action and concerns us all.
Â Â  .
Innovation is needed to combat climate change.
Â Â  .
I urge you, Commissioner, take the lead.
Â Â  .
Now we need to pull our socks up.
Businesses also need one.
Â Â  .
Why do airline tickets have to be so cheap?
Â Â  .
We need subsidies encouraging sustainable practices and efficient technologies.
You are MrÂ Barrosoâs guide.
There is no negotiating with Mother Earth.
That is why we must quickly limit emissions.
Sorting this out is a matter of urgency.
Legal proceedings cannot be taken against climate chaos.
Only then can we take care of our earth.
Â Â  .
I shall make brief comments.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Â Â  .
Thank you for listening.
MrÂ President, you emphasised the number of speakers.
Â Â  .
This is a most ill-informed proposal from the Commission.
The idea of self-handling is ludicrous.
Pilotage was included in this proposal.
Â Â  .
It could deal with this on its own.
Down with the confrontation model.
Long live the consultation model.
Â Â  .
Let me now turn to the matter in hand.
Why is this so?
The answer is quite simple.
There is no reason to do so.
That is simply not on.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Changes affecting self-handling are re-igniting criticism of social dumping.
Yes, maritime transport needs specific and precise reforms.
ConsequentlyÂ â¦
Â Â  .
These are big numbers.
It imposes controls that are neither necessary nor desirable.
The House should throw it out.
We need to reject this proposal first, though.
Adopting this directive will increase the risks and weÂ ...
There is not one port that welcomes the proposals.
They do nothing of the sort.
A port is primarily a site.
The Commissionâs proposal makes little sense.
In this case at least it has not succeeded.
This directive will have to be rejected.
I warmly support the amendments that serve this purpose.
Nevertheless, the Commission went ahead.
That is my appeal to them.
Our ports are privately owned.
There is currently efficient competition between European ports.
Who really wants this directive?
The Swedish June List will reject this legislative proposal.
Inappropriate signs like these have to be eliminated.
What are you trying to do?
Are you going to put cartels in the ports?
We know how they operate.
There is a positive modus operandi.
On the contrary, it might hinder their development.
Why do you not withdraw this directive?
Competition is needed between ports, not within them.
The questions that arise are therefore the following:
Does it violate the principle of subsidiarity?
For example, the authorisation system will increase bureaucracy.
In actual fact, there have been more jobs.
Â Â  â Thank you Mr President.
The best proposal is to withdraw it.
It is therefore unacceptable.
The Commission should make use of this opportunity.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  .
We need efficient and modern ports.
That is the situation, however.
That is your rapporteurâs theory.
MrÂ President, my task is a difficult one.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Our Community fleet needs efficient and competitive port services.
Â Â  . â The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
There are two ways of going about this.
Here too, the principle of reciprocity must apply.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We must simultaneously pursue both of these objectives.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Kyoto Protocol has demonstrated this.
Â Â  Mr President, I have three comments to make.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Titley.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  That concludes the first voting session of 2006.
1.

3.
Â Â  .
The important thing now is to use it.
Â Â  .
This was indeed madness.
Europe should not interfere in this.
Â Â  .
However, two proposals were particularly shocking.
Where will this madness end?
The European Union has no powers in this respect.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore welcome the rejection of the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Sexual exploitation and human trafficking must be combated.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is not enough, however.
A common, effective strategy is also needed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Yesterdayâs minutes have been circulated.
Are there any objections?
Would you please make a note of that?
Â Â  That will be corrected, Mr Poignant.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The issue has not gone away.
We have adopted ambitious legislation.
Now it is time to implement it.
Â Â  .
We should, however, move beyond that.
We should not just think about ourselves.
Reality calls for courage.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
A great deal of change is needed here.
Â Â  .
Who owns the supply company Ros-Ukr-Energo?
That is quite an achievement.
We regard it as a condition of WTO membership.
The resources that we now have are not sufficient.
That is something we have to bring about.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Not one.
We must look beyond ideological preconceptions and face reality.
Â Â  Mr President, I must keep it brief.
As I said, I will keep it brief.
Are there any possible alternatives?
It is not a company.
Empiricism is wiser than wishful thinking.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We also look into action at times of crisis.
At the same time, we should act immediately.
The same is true for renewable energy.
The Commission will do everything possible.
The same applies to Moldova.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
These impressive contributions certainly have produced results.
Sugar policy has many facets.
We have been ambitious and far-reaching.
As we all know, this reform is unavoidable.
There are four major aspects to this compromise.
Then there are the people employed in sugar factories.
Â Â  .
By and large, their pleas have been rejected.
That makes an absolute mockery of EBA.
Â Â  .
This had three main elements.
Â Â  .
All ACP producers were being offered the same.
Â Â  .
Of course it does not.
On the contrary.
We have presented proposals for this.
We must not deceive ourselves, however.
We cannot let them believe their future is assured.
Why should they have to do so?
What does this have to do with environmental protection?
This way needless fears can be dispelled.
Already in Greece farmers and workers are demonstrating.
The upshot of all this is clear to all.
It should be new and fresh funds.
I too felt that the sugar reforms were necessary.
Another problem has meanwhile cropped up.
And that is exactly the threat that I see.
This is a most peculiar kind of development aid.
Â Â  The debate is suspended until 9Â p.m.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Â Â  .
It notably concerns lost or stolen passports.
Â Â  I wish to ask a supplementary question.
That is clearly in order.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
However, there is also money for neighbouring countries.
Another consequence of the drought is the devastating fires.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you for your reply, Commissioner Å pidla.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  â Commissioner, your reply satisfies me completely.
Â Â  .
My answer is a definite âyesâ.
Does it propose to take any legislative initiative?
Â Â  .
Â Â  â Commissioner, you have not answered my question.
Does it intend to take any legislative initiative?
Â Â  .
How does the Commission view the above proposals?
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
So there is indeed considerable potential in this area.
Â Â  .
Thank you for the question.
I have two brief questions for the Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Then comes further and deeper cooperation.
Â Â  .
We have two options.
Â Â  .
Thank you for the question.
What we are seeing now is a dangerous spiral.
Indeed, two of them were held in Brussels.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for his detailed response.
That is the latest in a month of bloodshed.
Â Â  .
Thank you for the supplementary question.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time.
I shall just refer to prices.
This will be my request to the Commissioner.
Far more sugar is already being produced than consumed.
Those countries cannot possibly compete without further European support.
But are we crazy?
Sugar has other uses besides sweets.
How can we accomplish anything?
Unfortunately, the European Commission ignored this resolution.
The situation is similar in many other countries.
How have these countries been selected?
I shall be keeping a close eye on this.
Is the Commissioner aware of that?
Is the Commission?
Firstly, in relation to CÂ sugar.
I have particular questions for the Commission.
Perhaps the Commissioner could give me an answer.
Sugar-factory operators also share responsibility, however.
We do not need any more urban drift.
In that sense, the restructuring fund is vital.
They want alternative employment when their factories close down.
More funding is needed for research into this.
There is no need, everything has been debated.
Â Â  .
Let me first deal with the amendments.
I can accept that.
Many of you have mentioned bioethanol.
This is specifically a problem in the Mediterranean countries.
Nor can I accept the other amendments.
Therefore I cannot accept it.
Some last-minute amendments have also been tabled.
I am positive about the idea of Amendment 17.
This also includes the last-minute amendments tabled last week.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This is a political matter and one of principle.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I believe that democracy must be symmetrical.
I therefore agree with the Councilâs position.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This regulation enhances democracy in the environmental area.
My group is divided over this issue.
Take a current example.
We saw this with REACH.
Two points are of special importance to us.
This assumption needs to be taken further, however.
I would ask the Commissioner to clarify this point.
However, that is the way forward.
Some Members of this House oppose it.
I think that is quite obvious.
Â Â  .
There is no such provision in the Ãrhus Convention.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The directive is not, of course, perfect.
Directives are very rarely perfect.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall be very brief.
I am much obliged to him for this.
Â Â  .
Thank you, MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt.
The PSE Group supported the report from the beginning.
This is a success for us.
However, we lost an important battle.
In general we obtained a good directive.
This directive is worthy of our approval.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Discussions in the Conciliation Committee were complicated.
Â Â  .
However, lakes and oceans are obviously different.
He did a good job.
Â Â  .
It just makes them less hazardous.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have others yet to attain that accolade.
I support the directive.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The list does not stop there.
We have much to do in this area.
I should like to conclude on a positive note.
Â Â  .
We shall debate this when the time comes.
Sustainable development addresses issues which truly relate to citizens.
Sustainable development is the primary objective of the Union.
I am glad that the tone is reversed here.
The Commission must set medium- and short-term objectives.
I am opposed to this approach.
The report contains some fine objectives.
I therefore support this directive.
The cost to the environment must be priced in.
This will provide an incentive for environmentally better production.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
All of us have benefited.
It is also a matter of choices.
But we can create favourable conditions.
SMEs are a sleeping giant that we must waken.
The Austrian model is certainly quite interesting.
They often serve to pep up the political debate.
We need that balance.
Openness and protection are what is expected of us.
There is no getting away from that.
I make no bones about this.
Why not?
This is European taxpayersâ money.
We must work together on this.
I find that incredibly interesting.
It is not only about a document.
What connects us?
What internal forces actually hold us together?
We must bring it to life.
This discussion is also about the boundaries of Europe.
They are a political matter.
The political debate must focus on absorption capacity.
I am talking about a European way of life.
This applies especially to Europe.
Europe is teamwork.
The British held the presidency before us.
I wish you all the very best.
Member States have drawn up their national reform programmes.
This brings me to another important point.
The Commission document is an ambitious and concrete one.
The year 2006 will be a decisive period.
They had the courage of their European convictions.
It must be earned.
We need to concentrate on the essentials.
We need to focus on delivery.
Â Â  .
This is not confined to the large countries.
We shall not accept that either.
You spoke of employment, the economy and growth.
You spoke of openness and protection.
That is precisely the balance we must strike.
He will do that himself shortly.
Finally, energy was mentioned here.
We wish you every success in this effort.
Chancellor, you identified three aims.
That is Europeâs crisis.
That is what I cannot understand.
We want an agreement, MrÂ SchÃ¼ssel.
We want Europe to be structured efficiently.
It need not always involve more money.
What we have achieved is an unchanged budgetary structure.
Let us negotiate on that.
Europe also needs more red!
Â Â  .
Liberals and Democrats agree.
They cannot both be research priorities.
You did not say that.
Wonderful!
We are for that too.
You also spoke of the Services Directive.
I refer to the country-of-origin principle.
Are you for it or against it?
You have not told us.
Then we come to growth.
You rightly referred to training and qualifications.
It is time we understood that.
Â Â  .
You have inherited a minefield.
Good luck!
There lies the rub, in fact.
Â Â  .
So carry on as best you can!
What a wonderful agenda!
We shall have to debate that as well.
Let us continue in that vein.
The money is actually there.
We do have EUR 112 billion.
The only question is what is done with it.
Do that!
Take real action!
I could go on.
What about Danone and France?
What about MÃ¼ller dairy products and Germany?
What about the corporations governed by public law?
Open the doors!
Create real transparency about who gets what.
You have opportunities here; grasp them!
Transform yourself!
Become a European enlightener!
I see this as the essence of your speech.
We say yes to the Services Directive.
Let us get to work!
There are many tests to be applied.
The European way of life is not in danger.
It is not your responsibility anyway.
It has many facets.
People create the European way of life themselves.
Not a word did you say about that.
They are still here!
The Constitution failed to do that.
I wish you all good luck.
Is that not worthwhile?
I think it is.
Is it politically worthwhile?
Is it financially worthwhile?
How is Europe actually visible in my everyday life?
What shows me that I am a European?
This is why you must conduct a public debate.
You are, after all, in charge of .
You are a team player.
You are used to playing a tough game.
Half of your ministers are women.
That would be a success.
The first relates to the protection of minorities.
You are sure to succeed.
The other recipe is not to be conciliatory.
Stand by what you believe in.
What is dead is dead.
Some other Members have taken up that theme.
We have many inferiority complexes.
You referred yourself to the European way of life.
Represent Europe self-confidently in the world.
These are something that Europe provides all too often.
What was its undoing?
The threat from outside is that of terrorism.
You can count on our help.
That would be the last straw!
Let us take a close look at your figures.
It amounts to 1.09% of GNP.
Your pruning strategy gives us decisions to take.
In the fight against terrorism?
I have heard that Europol is to be reinforced.
Surely these exchanges are essential!
I do not think that is the way forward.
I therefore have some specific questions.
Can you explain how?
That is also a very important issue.
The UK Presidency was all about fine speeches.
Your own Presidency has to be all about action.
Humble proposals and effective action are required.
We can conclude this matter as quickly as possible.
Keep that squarely in mind.
MrÂ SchÃ¼ssel, I wish you luck.
MrsÂ Merkel says she would like a social protocol.
Mr Bot says that the project is finished.
Which of your colleagues can be right?
The first of these is energy security.
The Commission must be called upon to do more.
Maybe this is food for thought.
What we need is an obstacle-free common market.
We need a more flexible budget.
Be wary of this Parliament.
Put a bit of extra money into that!
Why?
Any treaty that has been concluded can be broken.
I refer to Iran, Russia and China.
Implement the Services Directive.
We have procrastinated long enough.
We must now take decisions.
Unfortunately, the budget is too small.
The first is that Europe needs strong own resources.
That is an important and basic premise.
Â Â  .
I wish her all the best for the future.
That is something that everyone must be aware of.
Iran is an issue of the utmost concern.
This is an area in which we need credibility.
That much is clear.
We can, however, get things started.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
This is not much, though.
Phobias are different kinds of anxieties.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  â MrÂ Costa, your request is quite clear.
Â Â  â Please let me finish.
These men and women can count on us.
We are not in solidarity with them.
Please vote âyesâ in the first vote!
Vote âyesâ, and throw it out!
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, I will be brief.
That is my regret dealt with.
I will suggest that it draws conclusions from them.
Â Â  â That concludes voting time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
1.
2.
3.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I do not therefore support Parliament's position.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Combating terrorism should fall into this category.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the SjÃ¶stedt report.
Â Â  . I naturally support this proposal.
That is regrettable.
I therefore voted in favour of the Maaten report.
Â Â  .
For this reason I vote against this resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Convention has a constructive purpose, then.
We have voted against AmendmentÂ 25.
Â Â  .
Our Parliament was short-sighted today.
I was of a different opinion.
Â Â  .
This is a denial of democracy.
It must be rejected.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Our decision to reject the text is final.
â The Port Services Directive will scarcely promote competition.
Ports are companies that compete with one another.
That is absurd.
This is fundamental for us.
Â Â  .I voted against rejecting the text.
I therefore condemn their ploys.
Their survival depends on our doing so.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Port owners and managers did not want the Directive.
Employees and trade unions did not want it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The âself-handlingâ proposal is absolutely unacceptable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  , .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Phobias are different kinds of anxieties.
Â Â  .
The principle of subsidiarity must be applied here.
It ought to be so in actual practice.
It must do so again today.
It is a clear and necessary political signal.
Â Â  .
Some of the debates have amounted to hate speak.
I object to this.
This is why I voted against.
There is nothing pejorative or malicious about the term.
There are no different categories of citizens.
These rights are guaranteed under law.
Â Â  .
It could well soon come true.
Paragraph 45:
The following are examples:
â debt cancellation for developing countries;
â environmental taxes at EU level;
â tax on labour in the Member States;
â employment and social integration.
I therefore voted in favour of the Ferreira report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is what todayâs argument is about.
That is what this dispute is about.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I will limit my remarks to four points.
I also took note of your favourite option.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is absolutely vital.
The question is, however, accountability for what?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What does this opinion say?
Â Â  .
Mr President, Mr Winkler, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
We need to turn that into a positive.
Â Â  .
This report achieves a synthesis of those two viewpoints.
Until then we need to keep all options open.
We need longer and deeper reflection.
What those measures are is left open.
This issue will not go away.
It is a serious problem.
The report presented to us states this very well.
It is not like that.
Â Â  .
That is a step forward.
That is where the problem lies.
It would be a missed opportunity.
Â Â  .
Why break your own rules?
You seem to have both eyes and ears.
Use them!
The proposed Constitution is dead!
Still you urge national parliaments to break the law.
You continue to propagate the text.
No, you could not, could you?
The SOS Democracy Intergroup has started a minority report.
Then we would know the verdict of the citizens.
Â Â  .
They also voted out of fear.
Nonsense!
Why not face the truth?
You lost.
We shall then define the appropriate measures.
This is not just an issue for institutionalists.
What, after all, is Nice all about?
Europe needs a new Treaty.
That is the reality.
They are not proposing anything.
Why?
Europe is now a thing of the past.
Nonetheless, we want to stay together.
Of that there can be no doubt.
There is no getting around that fact.
Yet this is precisely what you are doing.
It is not a thing of the past.
I should like to add one final comment.
How can we connect justice with efficiency?
The future allows us no room for fear.
Will the debate be able to move on?
It is time we got to work.
What is this work?
More to the point, where are these alternatives?
Â Â  .
What we need now is a discussion.
The Presidency will respond to it.
It is not something we have invented.
How do we deal with that situation?
There is nothing odd about these reflections.
You are making things rather too easy for yourselves.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
It is dead.
This is scandalous and unacceptable.
Â Â  I cannot support this report.
This does not seem to me to be credible.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I remember my visit very well.
That is our task now.
Â Â  .
Everyone remains conscious of the tragedy of Beslan.
Â Â  .
There are other proposals.
We cannot remain indifferent.
Chechnya must always be there on the agenda.
Â Â  .
There is no doubt about that.
Ultimately, a political process and negotiations are required.
Â Â  .
They simply were not.
I must emphasise this most strongly.
The people there felt defenceless and abandoned.
Strasbourg is our only hope.â
Lastly, todayâs resolution ...
We cannot allow things to progress in that way.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We now have to look at it.
You can be sure that we always mention things.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12Â noon.
Question Time will now be divided into two parts.
Â Â  .
Â Â  We now come to Question Time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Do we have any options?
If so, what are they?
Â Â  .
Â Â  Question No 2 has been withdrawn by the author.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We think that the funding is adequate.
Â Â  .
What tangible form should that European vision take?
Â Â  .
The Council endorsed this appointment.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Austrian Presidency very much supports this.
Â Â  .
These are countries with which we do business.
Â Â  .
We have raised it at the United Nations.
The same is true in other areas.
Â Â  I now have three supplementary questions before me.
They are permitted under our new system.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We believe that each case should be considered individually.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are doing our best.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  .
But what does the privilege bring?
Â Â  .
The stakes for our neighbouring countries are very high.
What do we want to do in the future?
For Ukraine the mandate is already there.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I wonder why not.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is simply tantamount to a Russian-Ukrainian condominium.
The third principle is as follows.
We must not further the interests of undemocratic governments.
We would do well to remember this.
It is worth highlighting this fact.
The North African countries are a good example.
We must do a lot more in this field.
I am worried.
Parliamentâs message is clear on this point.
What are our priorities to be?
Common values and common policy areas are needed.
Today, the situation is different.
He was seconded in this praise by Mr Barroso.
I address that comment to MrÂ Tannock too.
The process lacked concept, planning and project management.
Let us not repeat the same mistake.
The ENP should be everything but enlargement.
Let us speak about the ENP.
Point 2: We also need privileged partnerships.
Every power in history has had special relations.
The EU needs them as well.
Let us call that system the ENP.
Point 4: Criteria.
Point 5: Institutions and our capacity.
Four freedoms should be analysed.
Let us be open, transparent and logical.
Action to date in this regard has proved unsatisfactory.
European decision-makers failed to react decisively on this matter.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
I will come to that in a moment.
There is also a regional perspective.
There is still a lot to be done.
In the Mashreq there is an integrated gas market.
Let me answer a few specific questions.
Many have been asked here.
That is very important.
That is what we are trying to do.
Another question referred to Belarus.
That is already under way.
I really regret the media reports about Barcelona.
There is a report on migration.
Please read it.
There is a common position on combating terrorism.
Perhaps she might give me a written reply.
Â Â  .
Russia is not in the normal ENP.
Why?
Those are bilateral issues of the countries with Russia.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This Charter has provoked many attacks from businessmen.
That would help SMEs involved in international business.
Firstly, simplifying bureaucracy.
We need to turn words into action.
Â Â  .
All of us want to help you deliver.
A concrete proposal has been promised.
A social Europe must keep the spotlight on this.
How can they be key players in this strategy?
We are obliged to him for this.
Â Â  .
Who could disagree with that?
Â Â  .
Two-thirds of companies in Europe are classified as SMEs.
SMEs for us are an immense resource and opportunity.
An important goal must be to harmonise company taxation.
That too would facilitate matters.
We must provide real answers, Commissioner.
My second point relates to our fellow citizens.
I would therefore like to make a proposal.
Why not organise a European Good Practice Day?
I fully agree with him.
How?
We should not neglect this foundation.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
We are also protected by the Statute for Members.
The penalty must be justified in writing.
There will be no more discretionary powers.
I have kept one example to finish with.
Our group will therefore support this proposal.
Â Â  .
That is not the case.
That is intolerable.
Other similar actions are totally unacceptable, too.
Â Â  .
I still think that this proposal could be counterproductive.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at noon.
Maybe the rapporteur can clarify his intention here?
Â Â  .
I spent a whole day in Gaza.
It is a critical moment in the Middle East.
Yet revitalising Gazaâs economy is essential.
They are very happy.
We want to make a long term commitment.
I clearly reiterated that.
But to make progress, both sides must move.
Â Â  .
As colleagues know, democracy is my watchword.
But the key to stability is democracy.
Â Â  .
The situation in the Middle East is constantly changing.
Nevertheless, it still has huge symbolic value.
Â Â  .
The Palestinian Authority is in a very difficult situation.
The situation in occupied Iraq is still permanently destabilising.
The conclusions are, I think, obvious.
This too really is something to Israel's credit.
Â Â  .
Will the Middle East become democratic?
Â Â  Good morning, Mr President.
We know that.
Jerusalem is absolutely central.
I should like to acknowledge that duty.
Europe must decide how to deal with them.
Â Â  .
They are very interested in doing something.
One is the interim association agreement.
Hopefully, things will go in the right direction.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This report seeks to redress some of these problems.
Thank you, everyone.
This will mean implementing Community law better.
Men must also be fully involved in reconciliation measures.
Studies are regularly carried out by experts.
These studies are published.
Â Â  .
That is the first point I wished to highlight.
How?
The employment figures are still worrying.
Â Â  .
Things cannot go on like that.
The social partners must be more active here.
So where is the snag?
I am therefore asking you to increase the pressure.
All three are equally important, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
This would help reduce unemployment.
Our committee will be your ally in this endeavour.
Three percentage points more women than men are unemployed.
Only 10% of women achieve high-level positions.
This will not be achieved.
Absolutely no evidence is produced for this outrageous statement.
To me this seems somewhat late in the day.
Moreover, the gender pay gap persists across Europe.
They relate to the application of the Lisbon Strategy.
That is a great pity.
Young female candidates have difficulty obtaining research posts.
There is still discrimination over promotion.
New approaches need to be found here.
Education and lifelong learning are the keywords.
Most of the measures agreed remain on paper.
Inequality begins in the training period.
Â Â  .
Working women are not the cause of unemployment.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
It is the twin-track of prevention and care services.
I live with diabetes.
I have said that on many occasions.
We need a policy that helps people to overcome.
The Commission has also distributed its note externally.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hopefully we will see something by 2007.
Â Â  .
We are so well, healthy and rich.
We must give something back and more.
We like to put provisos in our aid packages.
Â Â  â Î¤he next item is voting time.
Â Â  â I have no wish to continue this discussion.
This amendment was voted on by the Committee.
The amendment was tabled by Mr Goepel.
I ask the House to reject this amendment.
Â Â  .
I therefore request a roll call vote.
Â Â  ).
Â Â  .
The rapporteurs will have nothing to do with it.
I shall let you have a series of corrections.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We can have a separate vote on it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â That concludes voting time.
Parliament is the institutional embodiment of freedom.
This regulatory is intolerable and destructive of freedom.
Â Â  .
I voted for this report.
Â Â  .
Take the United Kingdom, for example.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is not, however, a cross-border issue.
The June List has therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  .
They create jobs and wealth.
Could the solution come from Brussels?
I doubt it.
Â Â  .
The European Commission has ignored our requests.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the Vlasto report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The reform is essential.
I hope this will be listened to.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It takes its inspiration from nihilism.
We have arable land: they leave it fallow.
We have milk: they impose quotas.
We have vineyards: they tear them down.
For four years.
Long live death!
That was the rallying cry of the Brahmans.
Â Â  .
We need radical overhaul, not just modifications.
EU sugar production is around 17.4 million tonnes.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
international trade commitments entered into;
the stability of the EU market;
a less drastic reduction in prices;
the establishment of a trade regulation;
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
But are we crazy?
Sugar has other uses besides sweets.
How can we accomplish anything?
Â Â  .
The arguments were powerful, and we understood that.
I therefore voted in favour of the Fruteau reports.
Â Â  .
I voted for this resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is actually just as bad.
That is why I voted against this report.
Â Â  .
Let the people decide
The treaties can be amended only by unanimity.
Their verdict must be respected.
The is to decide whether treaties require popular approval.
Our alternative may be based on seven broad proposals
The constitution is dead.
Any exceptions shall be approved with 75 % support.
We should prefer mutual recognition to total harmonisation.
Defence should be completely separated from the Union.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The European Constitution has not âdiedâ.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Dialogue, yes, but about what?
Â Â  .
Public opinion does not need to be reassured.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I have voted against Amendment 26, 2nd part.
Â Â  .
We need good neighbours, cooperating partner states.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I welcome this report.
Â Â  .
1.
2.
4.
5.
I welcome the adoption of Amendments 36 and 38.
Â Â  .
On that, then, we are in agreement.
Â Â  We voted in favour of AmendmentÂ 19.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the Estrela report.
The diagnosis has long been known.
In general, the disabled are also poor.
The relationship works both ways.
This should be remedied.
It is horrific!
I have seen and met these children.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Good luck, President Bachelet.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
In either case, we cannot remain indifferent.
I am therefore in favour of the resolution.
The HCR must also bear some of the responsibility.
That is something that we ourselves must stop doing.
Â Â  .
We support the resolution.
I therefore find that criticism rather excessive.
The negotiations are underway.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I believe they are worthy.
Let us start there.
Â Â  .
Is it because Cambodia is too far away?
That is the bleak situation in Cambodia.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
It is the name of Chea Poch.
Â Â  It is an addition, Mr President.
It is âdefamingâ, is it not?
That was my original intention.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
This time they were Slovakian.
An unknown number of people are missing.
Â Â  Are there any comments?
Mrs Frassoni has the floor.
Â Â  All right, that will be done.
That was the first night of the year.
To do so would be a good decision.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  .
And that is just a small sample.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I wish to pay tribute to MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser.
Like everybody else, we were taken by surprise.
This is already an achievement.
However, we are also faced with a challenge.
We in the Commission have to find solutions.
Within the last hour I met Boris Tarasyuk.
We know how important these elections will be.
I could not agree more.
Yesterday we had the Afghanistan conference.
This, therefore, has to be our aim.
It is a recipe that can work.
We have therefore tried to be flexible.
Early results are highly positive.
We know there will be new demands.
This is not the case.
Â Â  .
And now the prognosis is worse than ever.
But so must Israel.
The role of foreign policy must not end there.
Most pressing is the question of Iran.
Stopping Iran building nuclear weapons must be our aim.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What can be observed?
Has the world become a safer and fairer place?
Where are we with this matter today?
Certainly, the popular rejection of Fatah is genuine.
Any hegemonic power tends to become divorced from society.
What should be done, then?
I have heard nothing on this matter.
Â Â  .
The political message is crystal-clear.
Â Â  .
The first priority is the Neighbourhood Policy.
Firstly, the way forward for Russia and Ukraine.
It is achieved mainly through common political will.
Central European Member States were also affected.
This debate has started in Israeli society.
Sufficient funds must also be made available.
I will not let diplomatic relations â¦
But they were betrayed.
Yesterday also marked another significant event.
The election results were a cry from the streets.
These concerns will now multiply.
This is also a technical matter, of course.
We have issued warnings about this in the past.
This agenda sets itself.
The European Union cannot ignore its responsibility.
Have we made mistakes?
Yes, there is a threat.
Î¤urkey's against Greece constitutes a threat.
The wall in Nicosia constitutes a threat.
The wall in Jerusalem constitutes a threat.
I shall begin with energy security.
I shall now move on to food security.
The second example is that of energy policy.
Commissioner, we await the report with eager anticipation.
Food security is vital to them all.
Who says that Joschka Fischer changed?
The first thing we need is a constitution.
Secondly, we need to speak with one voice.
Thirdly, we need to increase the CFSP budget.
All of those should be packaged into one.
But I have another point to make.
We need to remember that at this difficult time.
A pro-European front has to be created in Ukraine.
Gas has been used as a weapon.
That is crucial.
I agree with that.
Of course, such diplomacy sometimes needs patience.
Â Â  .
Pre-emptive diplomacy is the essential thing.
We want to continue what it has started.
Â Â  .
We want to make this debate useful.
So take note of that!
Therefore, you will always find me working.
Thanks also to those who do not appreciate it.
Mr President, I leave it to you.
If you do not, then do not.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  .
That is beyond question.
Â Â  .
Let me bear three elements in mind.
We also demonstrated our commitment to building democratic institutions.
I think this is clearly a principled position.
I think that would also clearly be a mistake.
This will take time to become apparent.
This applies to the EU-Palestinian Interim Association Agreement.
But others, too, must play their role.
USD 35Â million are still lying there.
Â Â  .
We heard the noise of democracy.
That is the challenge to all our institutions.
Â Â  .
You had to guide me through some difficult decisions.
I will mention two of them.
The withdrawal from Gaza was a unilateral decision.
Â Â  .
Madam President, elections are like a picture.
Millions of Palestinians are desperate.
We must respect this will.
But we must respect the will of the people.
That would be a recipe for failure.
Clearly, I share these opinions.
Yes, Hamas won.
Palestine is occupied.
The proposal sets out the relevant conditions for Hamas.
I would call on us to be consistent now.
Is the EU about bridges or barriers?
How many people will Hamasâs weapons kill?
How have they acted since?
This election result is a disaster for the region.
I beg to differ.
Do we have a plan to do so?
Hamas is a resistance movement.
What will we do then?
Under which conditions?
Do we have any plans?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Madam President, Mr Winkler, ladies and gentlemen,
We know why.
At the same time, they desire peace.
This has to be the way forward.
I very much wanted to mention this.
More precisely, this is Palestinian money.
I met Mr Wolfowitz yesterday in London.
I therefore invite Members to remain engaged with us.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
In recent years, the situation has deteriorated.
For political prisoners, the situation is very serious.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It must not do that.
We can wait no longer.
This is my appeal, from democrats to democrats.
If they vote like me, all the better.
Â Â  The situation in Cuba is very serious.
Europe could set a good example.
To ensure this, cooperation is required.
Does Castro bother about what Cubans think?
What was the reaction of ordinary people in Poland?
Cuba is not an appropriate place for a holiday.
It would be absurd.
Freedom of thought is not rewarded in Cuba.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  .
I attended that hearing on both days.
Hopefully that fear has been allayed.
Quite frankly, that was not leading us forward.
Â Â  .
This is an important point.
Thank you for your attention!
Â Â  .
It has not been possible.
Of course, this is completely untrue.
What is happening?
What is the Committee on Budgetary Control asking for?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is to be welcomed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
National management declarations!
Â Â  Mr Titford, I would call you to order.
So publish it!
Who gets what, how much and when?
The key issue at stake here is legislative clarification.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This question seems very technical.
Let us try to find solutions.
This is not true.
This is true.
This is a huge exercise.
The budget discharge includes millions of details.
A better understanding of the picture will certainly help.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mediterranean fisheries represent an important sector of Community fisheries.
We want fish stocks to be maintained.
We do not want overfishing.
We want sustainability in this sea.
The fishing industry does not want discrimination.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
The die is cast.
We cannot turn back.
Unfortunately, only one person survived the disaster.
May they rest in peace.
This is an issue of the highest importance.
Â Â  .
At EU level there are no reliable studies.
You may think this an exaggeration.
It is not.
I would like to invoke a classic liberal.
This legacy lives on in our Union.
What we need to do now is to act.
Â Â  .
Sometimes high-achieving professional women think they are untouchable.
Every woman can be abused.
These are horrific figures.
We need to act.
So what can we do?
That is very important.
We have to break this vicious circle.
We often also forget the children in these contexts.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Violence against women has existed throughout human history.
Others do not even recognise the experience as violence.
Violence cannot be a private matter.
Thank you for your attention!
This is not exclusively a developing world problem.
It may result in marginalisation and poverty.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
We must persevere and strengthen the legal bases.
This problem is not confined to France.
The facts that have come to light are shocking.
The woman died of her burns.
We cannot turn a blind eye to such cruelty.
The second cause is idleness.
Â Â  .
The legislation of the European Union is becoming unreliable.
Regulations may be breached continuously, without any consequences.
Â Â  .
The time has come for change.
Â Â  .
Thus they are also denied access to structural funds.
There are also some psychological differences between the sexes.
I will highlight just three issues.
They therefore lose out on many benefits and entitlements.
This is discriminatory and needs to change.
I suggest a level of 50% of women.
And why do I insist on that?
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Postal services are a growth sector.
I hope that it will meet with broad approval.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Community law must be applied in all Member States.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Answer that and this process will be successful.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The UK does not want it!
From Penny Black to EU attack in 166 years!
Is this progress?
The British people do not want it.
I hope British MEPs stick up for Britain.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Nor is the European Parliament clear about this issue.
Nor has the Commission done so.
I shall vote against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have labelling requirements.
We prohibit misleading advertising.
The Commission proposal did not even mention milk.
Nothing needed to change from the status quo.
Â Â  .
That report is available to colleagues.
We should always do that in our legislation.
Â Â  .
There are reasons for having regulations in this sphere.
On the contrary.
On the contrary.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
Communication is first and foremost a matter of democracy.
This is the key message of the White Paper.
It goes well beyond the remit of the Commission.
How can an EU communication policy contribute to that?
The fourth working area is understanding public opinion.
That is a challenge for policy makers.
Thank you for your attention.
I am looking forward to hearing your views.
Â Â  .
Our ideas must be followed by action.
Â Â  .
In communications less is more.
That is acceptable to us.
Only then can they be empowered.
Â Â  .
The Commission does not need a communication policy.
What it needs is transparency and democracy.
You could propose this debate yourself.
Â Â  .
First of all, action must follow.
We will make our views absolutely clear on that.
We certainly hold the same position on that issue.
This is about engaging citizens.
Children have another order of priorities.
We learned a lot from that consultation process.
This is what it is all about.
It is about the ethics of communication.
That is what we are trying to build here.
You are correct to ask about the budget.
It is called âEurope by Satelliteâ.
We do it in 20 languages.
This has been the idea from the outset.
The Brussels-based journalists are not happy.
They see a risk of competition.
I do not think this is a problem.
However, everybody is trying to cover their territory.
We have to be realistic.
Nobody will be competing with us on that.
There was no vote on this.
This is not only about voting.
We need to debate.
Finally, I agree with Mr Hammerstein Mintz.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The conciliation committee finally reached an agreement.
I am certain of that.
One final word on the digital tachograph.
MrÂ Markov, you questioned me on three points.
Â Â  .
We have also simplified and clarified certain terms.
We will do this on a consensus basis.
Â Â  .
Are you able to guarantee that, Commissioner?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is also evident in driving and resting times.
Compliance is still not monitored adequately.
Â Â  .
But will this reduce congestion and emissions?
The answer is no.
Is that too simple for the EU?
It has nothing to do with roads.
He obviously thought we were talking about the Eurovignette.
It is very embarrassing.
Firstly, tiredness kills.
That has to be the key to success.
Member States could do more than simply apply laws.
We hope the Commission will take greater action.
Let us emphasise constantly the importance of consistent implementation.
Â Â  Mr President, we have come a long way.
Mrs Jensen has said what needed to be said.
Previous documents appeared to overshoot this target completely.
All credit to the rapporteur, Mr Markov.
At least the industry now knows where it stands.
And here we go again!
Will they achieve this ambitious target?
They call this an attack on individual freedoms.
I therefore hope that you will really take action.
It is nothing of the sort!
I now think that we can feel satisfied.
Therein lies the problem.
Â Â  .
We therefore have here evidence of real progress.
That is nonetheless what the Commission had proposed.
I will now provide some more specific answers.
Therefore, please return to your seats in silence.
I now come to the use of the tachograph.
Â Â  â Thank you for your courage, MrÂ Barrot.
Â Â  I entirely agree with you.
I therefore share your regrets.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  MrÂ President, a word of explanation.
In the text, I quote in English,
The rapporteur has agreed to this wording.
Â Â  The English version is deemed authentic.
We should urge Hamas to be âcooperativeâ.
Â Â  These are technical corrections that will be made.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise under Rule 108.
Â Â  That goes without saying, MrÂ Wynn.
The request will therefore be sent to the Council.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
The regulation lays down four main elements.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We therefore abstained in the final vote.
Â Â  We voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  .
I have personal experience of this.
It was a powerless rage.
These centres are not prisons.
Violence is not a domestic matter.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is where we must start.
We must put a stop to this cowardice.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It also means applying in practice equal parental rights.
Policy is not determined by gender.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is understandable, but of little value.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Human rights abuses have increased, not diminished.
Â Â  .
That was a first step in the right direction.
Â Â  .
I will vote with reluctance for this resolution.
There is an issue of proportionality.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
If we condemn Cuba,
I will have no part in it.
All measures must be based on scientific fisheries research.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Â Â  The time for negotiations has passed, Mr Swoboda.
We have voted.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, please excuse me.
The vote cannot be invalidated.
Â Â  We have already voted, Mr Voggenhuber.
That would be the sensible thing to do.
Â Â  Very good, thank you for your observation.
It just cannot be true!
(1)
Regional cooperation is the way forward.
This is therefore unfair competition.
The European Parliament cannot remain indifferent to his situation.
We Poles are well versed in Gospel truths.
I am thinking in particular of the taxation dossier.
I disagree with my colleague over on the right.
It is on loan to us from future generations.
It is our responsibility to respect it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have some cheerful news.
This is on 16 February.
Thank you.
In Parliament we are still waiting.
Now both face the penalty of total non-payment.
Why are the Albanians rewarded and the Serbs punished?
Â Â  That concludes the one-minute speeches.
Â Â  .
I have questioned the Commission about this.
We need to press on down this road.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The sector cannot absorb this estimated loss of revenue.
Animal welfare will be the loser throughout.
Things may well already be different in practice.
Does the Commission have any idea?
On that we agree.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It would also substantially increase costs.
Some chance, I would suggest!
These standards are needed.
We therefore all agree that rules are needed.
Specific legislation in this area has therefore become urgent.
Today, Parliament must listen to their voices.
Animal welfare aspects should indeed be taken into consideration.
Therefore, excessively strict regulations are unacceptable.
They all have the same problem.
We must give consumers the choice.
They must know where the food came from.
I urge the Commission to do that.
This sector is already seriously threatened by non-European competition.
We should be grateful to receive your reply.
Â Â  .
So this proposal reflects the views of European citizens.
It is a compromise.
Others say we have gone too far.
The other costs affect competitiveness.
They should compete on the basis of quality.
We have letters; we have Eurobarometer.
One of the most sensitive issues was density.
We feel that the proposal is a reasonable compromise.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, Europe needs a competitive economy.
We must ensure that the opposite situation comes about.
What is required is that State aid be predictable.
The rules governing State aid must be generally applicable.
The same applies to companies in the public interest.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I congratulate the rapporteur once again.
We also wanted market failures to be better understood.
Â Â  .
It disrupts the market and distorts competition.
Global context is also important in the debate.
That is just by the by.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Britain is far from rich as it is.
Public housing is another example.
That cannot be what aid is for.
The threshold is the right one.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
The result of the HÃ¶kmark report is well balanced.
The same applies to venture capital funds.
None of us opposes competition.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I count my blessings tonight.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
That was made clear on your side.
Aid should be less and better.
It would have a very detrimental effect.
The question of innovation has been raised.
I am talking about less bureaucracy.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Globalisation has been present throughout the history of Europe.
The same is true today.
Â Â  .
Of course, there are legitimate concerns about globalisation.
Protectionism is not the answer.
It always has done and it always will.
For people first.
With jobs.
With thriving businesses.
Europe has a lot to offer.
Nothing is simply domestic any more.
Everyone will benefit!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Money spent by a politician is nearly always wasted.
Â Â  .
We need more action and fewer words.
The services directive is part of that.
Â Â  .
It causes concern and apprehension.
The reason is simple.
We have no alternative.
Seeing globalisation as a threat feeds calls for protectionism.
Shielding economies from competition does not make them competitive.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The committee certainly wants to see SOLVIT strengthened.
Â Â  .
SOLVIT is a tool designed for problem solving.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I very much welcome this question.
I want to declare a special interest in SOLVIT.
Â Â  .
This process will need appropriate human and financial resources.
Â Â  .
It deals mainly with administrative problems.
But I want to draw attention to something else.
Â Â  .
Unfortunately, it has not yet been fully developed.
We must not give in to public pressure.
Â Â  .
SOLVIT is about making the single market work.
Systems such as SOLVIT contribute to that.
SOLVIT has been a success.
Hundreds of problems have been solved through it.
That is what SOLVIT is.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
However, they should respect the principle of proportionality.
So why was the report drafted?
Â Â  .
That is what the Committee on Petitions does.
We are mediators.
We respond to the European citizens.
Â Â  .
Thank you very much for your attention.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Again nonsense, but it grabbed the tabloid headlines.
That is the difficulty now facing employers.
We have not given them legal certainty.
Â Â  .
It has been a long, hard battle.
I congratulate Mrs Weisgerber.
That is the nanny state mentality gone too far.
They also demonstrate the power of the European Parliament.
This is a good day for sensible legislation.
Sunlight should never have been included in the directive.
Â Â  .
Why should they not?
What I want to see is more economic probity.
What do you think, Thomas?
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Then there is a further extremely important aspect.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Europe must maintain a credible position.
Human rights cannot be used as a bargaining chip.
Europe must act in an honest and clear fashion.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This clause does suffer from some deficiencies.
I should like to mention the following key areas.
Â Â  .
Has this been properly thought out?
I think not.
I am concerned about our notorious double standards.
I congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur.
I could give you more examples.
The answer is obvious.
The unanimity principle ought to be made more flexible.
There is a decision to be made.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
Not every partner accepts exactly the same wording.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
For that to happen, two things are required.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We all know the substance of this report.
It reinforces the Schengen border code.
That must be our approach.
Congratulations to all concerned.
We must live up to our values.
In addition, it will stimulate cooperation between regions.
It addresses three important issues.
Therefore this is a very good proposal.
Its implementation in the field must be constantly monitored.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Subsidiarity is another key issue.
Â Â  .
Allow me to mention a few of them.
Parliament has made important efforts in this direction.
Â Â  .
I should like to mention three concerns.
We can and must do this at European level.
The sector also needs to be given some certainty.
Why?
Their potential is particularly great.
In conclusion, allow me to provide an example.
Some action is desperately needed in that area.
I could not agree more.
Â Â  Europe is the largest energy importer in the world.
What is the secret of this success?
These three considerations must always be seen in context.
Â Â  .
I am also passionate about this report.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
That is why we have so many checks.
Can you help us on that, Mr HÃ¶kmark?
Â Â  You are the rapporteur.
The next two parts fall.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
I therefore back the adoption of this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of this conciliation outcome.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  . We voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
Healthier birds produce a better quality product.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These are two questions that begin to answer themselves!
It is tragic that these were not adopted.
Â Â  .
This is why we voted against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
To err is human; to persist, diabolical.
That, though, is the real problem.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
My group was therefore unable to support it.
That is not acceptable.
Â Â  .
We doubt it.
It is not a simple issue.
I therefore support the adoption of this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have now come to a tricky corner.
Â Â  .
That must be a goal for us all.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Secondly, it will be good for consumers.
This can be done relatively quickly.
That is the balance we are all working for.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
From today, âBolkesteinâ is no more.
That we do know!
Â Â  .
This Parliament must make a choice.
Mrs Gebhardt says âthink of small businessesâ.
90% of service companies are SMEs.
They send people over to do market research.
We call it the âBerlin blockageâ.
This directive does not usher in social dumping.
It is still in force.
That is what Frits Bolkestein wanted for Europe.
Â Â  .
That is something that needed to be spelled out.
We cannot endorse this draft directive.
Â Â  .
Big deal!
In fact, nothing is less certain.
Â Â  .
But, seven years on, what has happened?
We shall vote ânoâ.
The new world order does not permit national resistance.
That is what we are fighting against.
Â Â  .
I wonder if his own MEPs do.
Â Â  .
This particularly related to financial services.
Â Â  .
That is unworthy of a democracy.
Â Â  .
Let us make good use of it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am bound to remind the House of this.
We wanted to make European integration a reality.
This would mislead European public opinion.
Â Â  .
I am simply in awe.
That is not the end of it, though.
Why has it taken two years?
I do not think that is reasonable.
The role of the Commission has been mentioned.
I think we can do that.
I would encourage them not to do so.
Not all services can be exported.
It would be good for the European internal market.
MrÂ McCreevy, MrÂ Barroso spoke about a misunderstanding.
What is stopping you from issuing this proposal?
Nothing could be further from the truth.
This is scandalous.
Â Â  Thank you, MadamÂ President.
Little remains of that text now.
Nonetheless, negotiations with Turkey were opened.
Our countries know best what is good for them.
Many people are asking why this should be.
You therefore cut me off; you can protest.
It was not finished â this is a provocation!
Nothing is out until we vote on Thursday morning.
Who decides what is necessary, proportionate and non-discriminatory?
We are not playing off one against the other.
Europe needs this services directive.
It is a tribute to the Presidency.
We have also committed ourselves to enlargement.
I am not talking about workers, however.
The demonstrations have helped to draw attention to this.
Â Â  .
The European Parliament can be proud of that.
This is also a directive of great symbolic meaning.
The Services Directive is one such occasion.
I wanted to get this off my chest first.
For that reason, ...
That is a win-win situation in legislation.
And that principle is now to be undermined.
Do I understand that rightly, Mr Bolkestein?
Not if we can help it, Commissioner!
The same applies to social care and services.
The directive must be fleshed out in practice.
Further economic stagnation of European markets should be avoided.
Here ends this fifty-year old quotation.
The following questions have been addressed to the Council.
Â Â  .
The honourable Member also raised the matter of Kosovo.
Both these processes must continue.
Ultimately they will have to merge.
That is our aim.
We must be prepared for all possibilities.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
One year on, this documentation is now available.
It is particularly great in education.
Â Â  .
Or how do you see this problem?
We can be proud of that.
The position at present is as follows.
We are endeavouring to make further improvements.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The long-term goal must be more transparency.
Has the Council agreed upon the mandate?
When will the Council have a mandate?
Â Â  .
I cannot be more precise.
All that is already under way.
That would be to prejudice the negotiations.
We owe that to Europeâs citizens.
My question relates to that.
We must take all these approaches.
That is not foreseeable at the moment, though.
Joint implementation is very valuable in that connection.
Â Â  .
What would its approach be?
Â Â  .
What can we do to increase their mobility?
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time.
That is what the nations of Europe want.
Will it cause a levelling down effect?
That is why we rejected it.
Competition in the social sphere is prohibited.
It was a question of upwards harmonisation.
We joined the Community wanting to be useful.
Sadly, this is not so.
The Directive proposes new restrictions.
They know that competition equals progress and growth.
But do we know this?
Another question is the range of services.
You go back to square one.
You start again from the beginning.
There are a number of other problems.
This arrangement will provide more jobs.
It will definitely move us in the right direction.
That constitutes significant progress for people and companies.
Now is the time to do just that.
Is that democracy?
Let us vote down this directive.
The EU cannot live on economic efficiency alone.
At the same time, we value national self-determination.
We shall support the compromise.
We want a better Europe!
This is particularly important for small and medium enterprises.
On Thursday we have two choices.
Anything else is marketing gone wrong.
Their action is scandalous.
We, in this Chamber, represent the citizens.
I urge you to reject the services directive.
The directive commercialises almost all services within the EU.
It will deprive millions of quality public services.
The Union also has a costly industrial sector.
It is expensive and ineffective.
My counter argument is as follows.
Consider what happened in Ireland and in Great Britain.
Both countries opened up their markets.
Did the employment rate increase or decrease?
Is unemployment rising or falling?
There can be only one conclusion.
This really is a far-reaching compromise.
It significantly alters the meaning of this text.
So let us make it simple.
Let us make them legal with these rules.
This is not about old or new Europe.
This is not about left or right.
This is true of the Services Directive.
The Services Directive could deliver 600Â 000 jobs more.
And why are transport workers and childcare workers excluded?
I support the provisions of Article 16 wholeheartedly ...
We have every opportunity to set the political agenda.
Some people believe that this is an unclear compromise.
How do matters stand at present, however?
What happens if we reject the directive?
I maintain that this directive would emphatically mean progress.
It is a genuine, widespread problem.
We are not talking about raising the drawbridge.
The internal market is not an end in itself.
Without added value, the compromise will be worthless.
Allow me to give two examples.
Is that sensible?
That really is idiotic.
European socialists are engaging in an historic battle.
This cannot be the way to do things.
Protectionism does not create jobs.
Why?
Compromises are possible and necessary to a certain degree.
We really must trust one another.
However, it requires a good measure of responsibility.
A compromise is still possible, however.
Services of public interest have also been excluded.
My second piece of bad news concerns the Commission.
I am a big fan of the Commission.
I always support it.
Please let that be the last time!
I believe we will move forward.
We need this directive.
Those are essential.
It is not.
It is about protectionism and liberal markets.
We must continue along this route.
I should once again like to thank both colleagues.
The five-year-maximum revision clause allows for gradual transitions.
This pressure poses a threat to the health services.
This financial pressure is difficult for us to endure.
This was not an easy decision.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is now your turn.
The inter-group compromise is the right way to go.
Europe needs economic growth.
Growth is achieved by increasing work or raising production.
The European Union seems to be afraid of itself.
I believe that the new Member States will manage.
So, what more do people want?
The compromise on Article 16 hardly confirms these .
This is by no means progress!
It means fewer new jobs and fewer new companies.
It is not what Europeans expect.
That has been the real conflict.
We have a reasonable compromise.
I admit that I was a dreamer.
Why should they?
Many traditional but inefficient companies had to close.
I bet you will not succeed.
I thank the Czech interpreters for their valiant work.
This directive can contribute to that.
I am the third to last speaker.
We have not been able to remove this obstacle.
Â Â  .
I welcome that.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
I do not think so.
Above all else, Europeans want more jobs.
Why should politicians obstruct this?
Small and medium-sized enterprises create the most jobs.
Services make the greatest contribution to Europe's GDP.
Let us give entrepreneurs a chance.
Let us give the entrepreneurial spirit a chance.
We have an opportunity to do good.
We must not waste it.
Let us choose real freedom.
Â Â  .
However, more aid will not be enough.
For example: how much would each proposal raise?
How stable and predictable would they be?
What are the competitiveness and sectoral impacts?
What would the launch and administration costs be?
Which proposals can go forward fastest?
Â Â  .
Several Member States already support these initiatives.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mr President, my group welcomes this resolution.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner.
It deserves our full support.
Perhaps we could improve it further tomorrow.
You did not even take it up.
The debate is closed.
Threats have been issued and boycotts imposed.
Â Â  .
This issue raises wider themes.
We must safeguard these principles.
Freedom of speech cuts both ways.
Freedom of speech has limits as well.
These must be respected.
Freedom of religion is not negotiable either.
Violence is the enemy of dialogue.
This, too, must be made quite clear.
Allow me to make one personal remark.
I did not receive an answer.
It must and will be exercised with responsibility.
That is the way things have to be.
That is something that I too fail to understand.
We cannot, however, change what has happened.
We must now look forward.
We know that we live in a globalised world.
That gives us a special responsibility.
Let us put behind us what the cartoons initiated.
Â Â  .
In society, we are entitled to express disapproval.
I ask that we all refrain from self-righteousness.
We must draw every possible conclusion from this.
Everybody must exercise their freedom while respecting everybody else.
Â Â  . â Good morning, little EU!
Globalisation has indeed arrived.
On freedom of expression we will never give in.
The editor of has apologised for the feelings raised.
He would not have published the cartoons today.
Blasphemy is a crime under the Danish penal code.
Every local editor must show global responsibility.
Several people have been killed.
He talked of dialogue and generosity instead of animosity.
Islam is not about the Danish Constitution.
Indeed, globalisation has arrived.
We all need to open our minds.
There is no easy one-way ticket back.
We must all live together on this globe.
We have no other globe available yet.
How can Europe respond?
Freedom can never be given away.
This I say also on behalf of the Council.
We must show solidarity on this.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Parliamentâs resolution today will make that clear.
We are offering constructive cooperation.
The country does not operate a single â¦
We should support this proposal.
We must reinforce our diplomatic options step by step.
The stakes are extraordinarily high.
How should Europe respond to this?
I do not believe that it will.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Only Syria, Cuba and Venezuela rejected the proposal.
The use of nuclear energy in itself is problematic.
We fear the person in possession.
So let us look at the facts.
The story of David and Goliath is repeating itself.
What are the facts?
That is intimidation and it is an-ti-de-mo-cra-tic!
We should engage in dialogue, not threats.
Threats always lead in the wrong direction.
NoÂ one ever got hurt from di-a-logue!
This is essential to our credibility.
We should not give fundamentalism or fanaticism any chance.
The religious fundamentalists of Iran are not rational.
Neither the US nor Israel can protect us.
The Persians are not Arabs.
Its natural historical partner in this hegemony is Russia.
We are forever repeating the same words.
Iran is constantly creating new situations.
We therefore call on Members to vote againstÂ ...
Our problem is not the country and its citizens.
This is where the greatest danger lies.
Todayâs Iran is potentially dangerous.
We hope that it succeeds in doing so.
That is why I am delighted with this resolution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the current debate is very important.
That is an important point to emphasise.
There is also the human-rights issue.
Â Â  .
What are the options for the future?
The Security Council represents the home of international legitimacy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Iranian society seems to be drowned in silence.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
In theory, one could refrain from voting altogether.
We nevertheless give priority to the need to vote.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I mentioned the term âreferendumâ before.
Â Â  .
So what is the prognosis now?
Â Â  .
Bosnia and Herzegovina is genuinely at a crossroads today.
We are ready to support this process fully.
Â Â  .
This is a good thing.
That is not the solution.
I strongly support the recent Commission Green Paper.
That sort of thing must not happen again.
A lot has been said here about Islam.
That is all tied up with Bosnia.
I am quite certain of this.
I have in mind AmendmentÂ 2 in particular.
The Bosnia process is therefore exemplary.
Â Â  .
Many thanks, again, for your interventions.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Commission remains committed to doing its part.
Independent polls give him around 55% support.
Â Â  .
The opposition bears the brunt of the decision.
What more can we do?
What will happen next?
What sort of relations will we have with Belarus?
That was known as liberalisation.
Â Â  .
This will call for a number of organisational measures.
It is an impoverished country.
It does not know to what it should aspire.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
This is a most deplorable act.
I regret that it did not do so.
The situation in Belarus is becoming worse and worse.
For that to happen, democracy is required.
Repression of the non-state media continues to intensify.
Â Â  .
It is therefore a Europe-wide project.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  Madam President, let me give you the score.
It is EPÂ United 1, Racism 0.
I thank all Members who have signed.
This is a historic moment.
We will take the following questions to the Commission.
Â Â  .
There is no such Community legislation for private vehicles.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It has initiated a far-reaching process to that end.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
I think we can all agree on that.
Your view is absolutely right.
Â Â  .
Clearly, society cannot take responsibility for everybody.
Â Â  .
Those discussions are ongoing.
Solutions in this sector take time.
Planning takes time and resources.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am sorry.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you for the question.
It varies from culture to culture.
It is crucial that that we stimulate that.
Secondly, how will commercial confidentiality be safeguarded?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Regions have always been partners to the framework programme.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is crucial.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Pulling the strands together practically is crucial.
That is happening with or without our investment.
Private funding is even more important than public funding.
All these things matter.
Â Â  .
It should not be seen as the final word.
I very much appreciate your support.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m is in bed with the flu.
That is the reason.
Â Â  .
When will the call for proposals be published?
Â Â  .
Â Â  I welcome the Commissionâs answer.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is the intention for the future.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There is no money for the relation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
At no time has renationalisation been proposed.
On the contrary.
Â Â  .
This is very important.
Do such instruments exist and will they be effective?
Â Â  .
It is possible within a Member State.
This aid amounts to approximately EUR 35 million.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
I am now following that very closely.
Â Â  .
Not all of those countries produce sugar.
On the figures, this is an ongoing discussion.
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  .
We therefore need to study this area further.
This was specifically requested by the European Parliament.
Â Â  .
Our main criticisms are reserved for Option 3.
This relates to providing basic coverage against income crises.
Â Â  .
That is emphatically the worst thing in the report.
Â Â  .
Europe has a duty to encourage this.
That really has to be the way forward.
Farming is in transition as never before.
Farming is confronted with more risks than ever before.
In many cases it is a whole family transaction.
I commend the rapporteur and his report.
A number of these actions have already been taken.
Â Â  .
This is hopefully a simplification.
I am therefore particularly looking forward to that discussion.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am not against private forest ownership.
The Polish forestry model is efficient and effective.
State-owned forests are a self-financing, profit-making institution.
The infrastructure linked to forestry needs modernisation.
Western Europe can learn from experience too.
Not everything that is private is always best.
Non-private forests also need support.
Once again, many thanks for this report.
My sincere thanks go to him for that.
This is quite right.
Forest owners play a major role in forest management.
Around 60% of forests are private.
Forestry in Central Europe is characterised by multifunctionality.
It has been allocated EUR 6.5 million.
Â Â  .
Quite a few honourable Members mentioned state-owned forests.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Forest owners are also among the guarantors of biodiversity.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These courses were promoted by the local Leader group.
Benefits will flow from that.
Without people, we have very little else.
That is robbing Peter to pay Paul.
It is also unworkable in its current form.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I support the report of Mrs McGuinnes.
Â Â  .
My sincere thanks go to her for that.
For example, unemployment is greater in these areas.
The European countryside faces big changes.
The Commission is proposing several different possible solutions.
We must insist on this.
We must therefore coordinate these.
It concerns society as a whole.
This is all very well.
Rural areas develop where agribusinesses flourish.
Rural development should stand on its own two feet.
This is a good report.
This is the way forward.
We cannot afford to live in a time warp.
Today that is no longer enough.
Â Â  Over half of our population lives in rural areas.
I propose that this excellent report be accepted.
I thank the rapporteur for her work.
Â Â  .
Now we need to continue with the planning.
That is acceptable.
I congratulate Mrs McGuinness on her report.
I have very much enjoyed listening to the debate.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Why is this item not on the agenda?
Your point of order was not appropriate.
The following amendments have been proposed:
I am sure that they will act accordingly.
People should not be treated like fools.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Cohn-Bendit.
All this is nothing new.
Last week was also Endometriosis Awareness Week.
I feel that this is essential.
This is an extremely serious issue.
The atmosphere during the election campaign is dangerous.
We should not allow this under any circumstances.
The situation in Belarus is abundantly clear.
It is very difficult indeed.
It is absolutely vital that we are involved.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Harbour.
That is not sufficient, however.
The competitor was the Gliwice factory, in Poland.
What we need is a European industrial policy.
No young person should be discriminated against or suppressed.
There is absolutely no security there.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Chruszcz.
That concludes this item.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
Let us make ourselves heard loud and clear.
None of them has ratified it yet.
Â Â  .
We want answers today if at all possible.
Under no circumstances whatever can it be tolerated.
Victim protection schemes need to be put in place.
That is quite splendid.
Absolutely not.
Women are not a commodity.
They are not for sale.
Â Â  .
In-depth checks are necessary.
Thank you.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
It would have broken my heart to interrupt you.
Â Â  .
That is why close monitoring is needed.
These, then, should be included as well.
And what about the mobility of prostitutesâ clients?
Any study must also take account of that.
That is indeed good news.
It was the first of its kind.
It increases the number of victims of trafficking.
Do we really want to fight trafficking?
There is a way.
Are we brave enough?
Trafficking in human beings is slave trafficking.
It is discriminatory and shameful and a disgusting crime.
Â Â  .
Legal restrictions are needed.
The fate of the rapist is unknown.
Even the European Community has not signed this document.
I thought Commissioner Frattiniâs response was excellent.
Let us talk about how to do that.
The trafficking of women is linked to illegal immigration.
Thank you in advance.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It is detrimental to encourage or ban investment decisions.
Â Â  .
Company relocations raise many concerns.
Â Â  .
I am not talking about crooks here.
That example shows what is at issue here.
Â Â  .
Companies tend to view relocations as an investment.
Â Â  .
Meanwhile, Ryton faces an uncertain future.
Nothing could better illustrate the illiteracy of EU economics.
These deficits inhibit regional competitiveness.
This would be restrictive and anti-democratic.
My congratulations to the rapporteur.
That is indeed something that Europe must deal with.
I can only approve of the measures proposed.
This social blackmail is coupled with fiscal blackmail.
Policy which facilitates relocation thus damages social cohesion.
Five years is far too short a period.
Thereafter, the focus is exclusively on negative mechanisms.
We now have a balanced text.
There is another argument against helping firms to relocate.
Â Â  .
This sort of decision is determined by numerous factors.
â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  .
Furthermore, we must promote good agricultural practices.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Simply building a well is therefore not enough.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Firstly, the question of rights.
This right must be established by an international treaty.
Lastly, the question of management.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
The Council must increase the resources available.
Â Â  .
That is why this instrument is extremely important.
We must learn from them.
Â Â  .
The Commission supports most of the proposed amendments.
I should like to comment in particular on prevention.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
On that issue I wish to say the following.
A great deal more needs to be done.
The second amendment concerns mercury-cell chlor-alkali plants.
Â Â  .
It is of fantastically high quality.
Moreover, the figures are falling all the time.
That decision is long overdue.
Please tackle that.
The legislative measures must follow later.
All of my amendments were accepted by the committee.
I should like to briefly underline their content.
Public information is crucial in this case.
Â Â  Mr President, of course your invitation is welcome.
These measures are already at the preparation stage.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
This has not happened.
We do not have any problems with this.
Â Â  .
Let me explain this in detail.
Â Â  .
There was no avalanche of workers.
Â Â  .
The European economy and the labour market need people.
Â Â  .
MrsÂ Schroedter mentioned this in the case of Germany.
Such fear is entirely groundless.
What conclusions can be drawn after these two years?
Social problems have not either.
What has happened is quite the opposite.
We live in a Community.
Expansion has encouraged the legalisation of previously illegal jobs.
Why is there such huge opposition to restore justice?
I will begin by mentioning the Services Directive.
What can one conclude from this?
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  .
Nevertheless, these directives are already obsolete.
But who should lead this change?
We should be talking about the ubiquitous information society.
Information and communication technology no longer mean audiovisual technology.
How much cleverer is a person in intelligent clothing?
It creates most jobs in industry.
Unless we pull ourselves together, disaster awaits us.
Some amendments have been made to my report.
I hope this approach will be looked upon favourably.
Â Â  .
To all of them I express my thanks.
Â Â  .
There are still very few women in this area.
Their role is therefore socially important and often decisive.
This will be the dominant language of the future.
Women do not need to hear things repeated.
Women need decisive action.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I will refer briefly to a number of issues.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this report.
Social inclusion is of course a key factor.
Let me mention a few of them.
How do we want to shape frequency policy?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The second level is the information received by consumers.
Some of you also mentioned roaming.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
This must be included in our cohesion policy.
We must provide high standard, safe content.
We must take action urgently.
Â Â  .
Society changes, moves on, modernises.
Each new decision we take may result in restructuring.
Â Â  .
Industrial and less skilled jobs will disappear.
Â Â  .
We refuse to accept this prospect.
The way he did this was excellent.
Completely new workplaces have grown up.
That development will continue.
Firstly, we must have long-term planning.
Then, factories will simply have to close down.
There will be no alternative.
Secondly, there must be participation.
Thirdly, experiences must be shared.
I visited the Dublin Institute last weekend.
Â Â  .
This has been emphasised by several people.
A tailored response really is needed.
Finally, there is support for disadvantaged regions.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
So, how did we do it?
How did we restructure?
Nor were EU funds involved.
Â Â  .
This extra time has certainly been necessary.
That is the real challenge that we face.
That is the truth.
How are they supposed to restructure?
So what are we to do there?
What shall we do?
How can we help?
This is the reality.
We have a major problem.
Nothing is working today.
What are we to do there?
Let us make a new army of .
That is the problem.
The report ought also to emphasise this aspect.
Â Â  .
These directives must be strictly upheld.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The demographic issue has not been resolved.
The Lisbon Strategy has been far from successful.
Who takes solidarity between the generations seriously?
There is no hierarchy of oppression.
Why do we need one?
This European Gender Institute is what we need.
It needs to be made visible in this way.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
So be it.
That is contrary to fact.
I would like to point to four of them.
Â Â  â I am delighted with this report.
That is not the case.
This is happening against a background of high unemployment.
This is because we simply are not equal.
They do not need an institute.
Â Â  .
The issue of equal opportunities is a broader issue.
I fully support this argument.
Even from this perspective the institute can enhance quality.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
The arguments presented in the report are unconvincing.
The Commission consists of 18 men and 7 women.
Approximately 30% of MEPs are women.
Thank you for the floor!
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
This important initiative is not an isolated one.
Your personal experience makes you almost the model European.
Your personal experience took you away from Europe.
Â Â  .
Europe presents a puzzling aspect to the world.
What do we say to that?
So many challenges, so many opportunities!
Europe must regain its fitness.
There it is â the typical creative ferment.
They are to be found in Europe.
Let us show ourselves to be real Europeans.

3.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Â Â  .
The rest of the amendment will remain unchanged.
Â Â  Are there any objections to this oral amendment?
Â Â  That concludes voting time.
We are all agreed on this.
All the rest is mere political correctness.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That would be the first step towards equality.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The end does not always justify the means.
Â Â  The EU has too many authorities and agencies.
Â Â  .
This is an excellent report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Among other things, the European Parliament wants:
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of this regulation.
Prevention is a fundamental part of risk reduction.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There is also the issue of maritime pollution.
Terrorism mainly affects countries with colonial foreign policies.
Â Â  .
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  An ever more globalised world creates new requirements.
Â Â  .
We therefore choose to vote against the report.
Â Â  .
Our proposals were as follows.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Amendment 6 brings forward the deadline for restricting exports.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of this text.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Common sense has prevailed here.
Human exposure must be restricted to an absolute minimum.
Â Â  .
This mistake cannot be repeated.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The report has three main priority objectives.
Â Â  .
It is a relatively small percentage.
The measures that you have proposed are controversial.
I do not know whether these allegations are true.
Â Â  .
Europeâs trade defence measures target unfair trade.
They cannot protect us from tough competition.
That dumping is causing serious injury to EU producers.
Imposing a duty on dumped goods is not protectionism.
The textile issue concerned fairly-traded textile imports.
Let me address this briefly.
We cannot block globalisation and economic change.
Â Â  .
Could you also answer one or two other questions?
Why have they had the need?
Could you answer that?
You say not.
However, I still feel concerned.
I should like you to answer one final question.
People see us as being protectionist.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
You have not announced any dumping levies until now.
This is clearly not the case here.
Commissioner, you have got an impossible job.
How can 25 countries have one single trade policy?
Do you recognise that?
Â Â  .
I would, however, appeal for consistency.
Unfair competition is the biggest ally of protectionist impulses.
This is a serious concern.
We are behind you.
Your proposals are neither robust nor enlightened.
Today, growth-starved capital is also leaving those countries.
For Sweden, the figure is even more appalling.
What lies behind this dumping?
That is part of the reason.
Here too, we must be consistent.
There is no justification for this gradual approach.
I cannot see how consumers will benefit.
Â Â  .
They are very different cases.
Far from it.
One concerns the impact on consumer prices.
Let us put this case into perspective.
This sampling takes time.
I do not understand this.
We cannot and will not do that.
Â Â  .
It is important to do that.
Let me add this related comment.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Once again, we must report that:
Â Â  .
This change has been radical.
Some of the planned objectives have been fully achieved.
The extradition procedure has been made much shorter.
To conclude: is more or less harmonisation needed?
I believe that more is needed.
Â Â  .
That is a quite essential consideration.
That, too, is a quite essential consideration.
That, too, must be our common concern.
The work entailed by this is running to timetable.
Â Â  .
Congratulations Mrs Hazan.
Combating crime is not just a national issue.
It is pan-European.
Â Â  .
Borders are therefore no longer an obstacle to justice.
Â Â  .
My group broadly shares her assessment and her concerns.
I had the honour to do so in 2001.
I have two questions today.
The first is to the Council.
The second question is to the Commission.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Someone should tell MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m ...
I refer to the European Arrest Warrant.
Clearly, a change is required.
Particular attention must be paid to these difficulties.
Â Â  .
I will discuss the question later on.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The following questions have been submitted to the Council.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is the point we should bear in mind.
So we are reflecting on how we should proceed.
Â Â  .
How will the Council assist NGOs in Ethiopia?
Â Â  .
We looked into them and took them into consideration.
Political developments in Iran are very disturbing.
Nothing has happened.
Iran has a regime that breaches most human rights.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I thank the honourable Member for the encouragement.
Â Â  .
That is exactly the policy of the European Union.
Â Â  â Absolutely.
That is one very important aspect.
That is a crucial aspect.
That is another crucial aspect.
All power to your elbow!
Ministers go on here with very long replies.
We were told to table questions to her.
We had to wait until March.
It does not work.
From acorns grow oak trees.
Racism and xenophobia are very often connected with prejudice.
Â Â  My sincerest thanks for these comments.
Mr Newton Dunn made that point.
We have waited for three months.
The Minister has been very gracious.
I have never seen that happen before.
This one simply does not work.
Please consider going back to the old system.
That concludes Question Time to the Council.
Â Â  Many thanks, MrÂ CarneroÂ GonzÃ¡lez.
Part I
Â Â  .
Â Â  I would like to thank the Commissioner for that.
We actually had the same objective.
So thank you for that information, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The question concerns interest rate policy and monetary policy.
Its independence is enshrined in the Treaty.
Â Â  .
I can only speak as an economist.
Â Â  .
We do not intervene in those policies.
Are there signs of any change?
Â Â  .
I can only discuss this issue as an economist.
Â Â  .
Hopefully, appropriate funding will be available.
I am delighted about the simplification measures you presented.
Are these fears justified?
Â Â  .
Thank you very much for the additional question.
This is much needed .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There have been 1.4 million Erasmus alumni since 1987.
They are very influential programmes for individuals and societies.
People get a lot from those programmes.
They are asked for more and more.
I fully agree that these are needed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you and let us work together on this.
Â Â  .
That sort of thing should not happen.
However, informal consultations are recommended.
Visibly they are quite different.
So the risks are limited.
Â Â  .
This will be negotiated.
Can the Commission give the details of this analysis?
Â Â  .
The system is very independent and complicated.
Why Laeken?
That decision was taken by the Belgian Government.
All the infrastructure is provided by the host country.
The Board of Governors will take the decisions.
That is the picture today.
Â Â  MrÂ Kallas, thank you for your reply.
Â Â  .
Therefore, option B is not the best one.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are trying to find a compromise solution.
That is the process.
All possible solutions and aspects will be discussed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Of course, the key is implementation.
We have huge concerns about that.
I believe that is crucial.
Â Â  .
They carry out the same kind of actions.
How long does it take in this field?
That is a very relative concept.
This will be the focus of our peer review.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Why should this be so?
This is the paradox of developed societies.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Poverty naturally breeds poverty.
Europe must get its house in order once again.
The Scandinavian countries are a good example of this.
This problem must be dealt with today, however.
The concentration on child poverty is welcome.
Â Â  .
The opposite is the case.
This would enable all citizens to feel safe.
The current procedure is totally unacceptable.
The nature of restructuring varies from region to region.
I propose that the report be accepted.
Â Â  .
We must first raise the profile of European coordination.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Section I â European Parliament
Section II â Council
Section IV â Court of Justice
Section V â Court of Auditors
Section VI â European Economic and Social Committee
Section VII â Committee of the Regions
Section VIII(A) â European Ombudsman
Â Â  .
Moreover, appropriations should relate to specific activities.
Â Â  .
This is conditional on several factors.
We must always consider our accountability to the taxpayer.
This will cultivate the credibility expected of Parliament.
One important example of this is information policy.
Expensive solutions are not always the most effective.
We have had a reference to information tools.
One idea that has been explored is web-TV.
I am firmly in support of that idea.
Â Â  .
My warmest thanks go to him accordingly.
This in itself is a very good thing.
Â Â  .
Both these committees have had their day.
Let us have an end to this.
I am saying this as a pro-European.
Furthermore, we should think about minimising the cost.
Is it necessary to reach the 20% ceiling?
Of that I am sure.
I support MrÂ Grechâs request.
This is a genuine request.
However, there is a downside.
Well, that is my wish list.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
The Council is about to complete its first reading.
I am very much obliged to you all.
Only 5â25% of applications are successful.
I should also like to present a few more.
That is wrong and we should change it.
Â Â  .
It has taken a lot of time and concentration.
My warmest thanks go to them for that.
Now is the period of interim evaluation.
Â Â  .
Reform of the Financial Regulation really is desperately needed.
Â Â  .
It was becoming urgent to reform it.
The same applies to public procurement.
We can only congratulate her on this achievement.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Are there dishonest people in the fisheries sector?
This is an urgent matter.
I started my presentation in defence of fishermen.
Â Â  .
I have noted your interest in combating ghost fishing.
They will hopefully be concluded by April.
One million tons are discarded in Europe every year.
Â Â  .
The report is very timely.
Illegal fishing renders the situation impossible for all parties.
Certification and quality marks are therefore important.
Â Â  .
Mesh sizes for fixed gears must be harmonised.
I think this is eminently rational and indeed noble.
Fifthly, seas know no borders.
The cod recovery plan has not achieved the objective.
We need to look at where we are going.
We have that opportunity through the regional consultation process.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Some of them have asked to do so.
Â Â  .
That is our heartfelt wish.
Â Â  .
That must be our aim.
Who benefits from what happened?
However, I do have three questions.
Why was this international commitment not honoured?
Why was it not used?
Â Â  .
Nothing can justify the attack on the prison.
Nor can anything justify the hostage-taking that followed.
Â Â  .
Unilateral mutual contempt leads to a dehumanisation of action.
We can see this in practice in that region.
The Israeli action was outrageous.
The prison in Jericho was no longer a prison.
That is also the truth.
No prisoner has escaped or tried to do so.
Can we accept that?
It really is hard to credit.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am afraid that it all goes much deeper.
That seems to me to be the current situation.
Are we to continue this cycle of violence?
No, we must not.
The situation is really extremely serious.
Nevertheless, they were free and fair.
It was their duty to deal with it.
They did not: they walked away.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The same applies to the committees.
This wastes EURÂ 12Â million a year.
The vote will take place following the debate.
Â Â  .
The necessary instruments are in place.
I would be grateful.
Â Â  .
I will abbreviate my comments and conclude.
Â Â  No, Mr President.
That is good news.
Let us move up a gear.
We agreed to work together within a partnership.
Let us be clear.
What is more, the facts prove you right.
I am impatient to see other countries join them.
This is not the moment for economic nationalism.
Let us be clear.
Let there be no misunderstandings, however.
The Commission will respond positively to your consensus.
We must achieve better integration.
We must stay there.
However, our systems are fragmented.
They do not appear to be connected.
Too many of our top brains are leaving Europe.
It is an ambitious project.
Â Â  .
We need to bear that in mind.
I say that quite independent of any party-political affiliation.
This is about the institutions of the European Union.
Together we will forge Europe, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit.
We need the entrepreneurial spirit in the European Union.
Entrepreneurial spirit means creating jobs.
We need a positive perspective in this connection.
You referred to GALILEO and Airbus.
The Committee concerned has written to you.
I apologise for this interruption.
Â Â  I regret this interruption as well.
Â Â  .
That is the situation after six years!
You cannot build a beautiful house with different-shaped bricks.
You cannot even build a shack.
Welcome to the valley, MrÂ President!
The downhill race is now over.
I can only warn against deviating from it.
Â Â  .
These are issues for the Spring Council.
Â Â  .
This was very clear in MrÂ Winkler's speech.
Why do I say that?
Is electricity in France and Germany cheap?
No, it is expensive.
The market cannot currently be applied to energy.
Why, for heavenâs sake?
That is the choice facing us.
I think this is something we can achieve.
What do we want?
A political union is our primary goal.
That is not what we want.
The EU is an opportunity.
Particularism and protectionism are our own home-made risk.
That is the threat hovering over the Lisbon Strategy.
We need a more generous European immigration policy.
The Europe of research is still to be built.
Let us consider the free movement of capital.
And what are we to think of Skoda?
Firstly, the free movement of workers.
I turn now to my second example.
What was the problem with this principle?
Now for my third example.
They are more a result of global development.
Our problem is what happens at the end.
In fact, it is somewhat bogged down.
The social dimension is not inimical to competitiveness.
It is time to grant them that basic freedom.
That is the fundamental problem.
But what about wage rises?
Wages are staying where they were!
That is what we need!
We should not be afraid of the Lisbon Strategy.
It is an opportunity for us all.
We know what we have to do.
It is time for action.
I shall focus upon that.
We need more growth.
I have two short questions.
Number one: investment.
That is how development proceeds.
That is how development proceeds.
All this presupposes the adaptation of our infrastructures.
Is that possible?
No, it is not.
We propose measures in three areas.
The time for diplomatic niceties has passed.
We have made progress, but not enough.
We need proactive labour markets.
Deliver, do not talk!
Reforms are necessary, though.
There is work to be done.
That too is not a threat.
That has happened now.
The second point relates to the financial perspective.
There is an urgent need for an interinstitutional agreement.
There is no time to waste.
Â Â  .
I also have something to say to Mr Bonde.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Â Â  â Thank you very much.
We shall look into it.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Our split vote concerns the deletion of the time-limit.
âThat concludes voting time.
Â Â  .
This is neither a consistent nor credible policy.
Â Â  .
The report points to improvements that have been made.
Others have retained or reintroduced verification of double criminality.
We have thus chosen to vote against the report.
Â Â  .
The report before us confirms our criticisms.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Union will soon have more auditors than auditees.
It is therefore important.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We say no to all forms of prostitution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The social consequences of restructuring must therefore be alleviated.
Nevertheless, the SEB group is doing well.
Its profits are growing.
The job market would gain from this being done.
Â Â  .
The European Parliament wishes, among other things:
We have thus chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am therefore voting in favour of it.
The report contains proposals to the effect that:
We have thus voted against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am voting for the Grech report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We must put an end to this vicious circle.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Nuclear power remains a high-risk technology with incalculable consequences.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thirdly, we need to facilitate people-to-people contacts.
These are very wise words.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We can, of course, rearrange things somewhat.
That is the problem!
Â Â  .
We note the absence of any mention of membership.
That is disappointing.
Allow me to comment on the Middle East.
I think that this was an extremely wise decision.
There is no room for compromise on this.
What are the real questions?
It is high time that that debate took place!
We must take on our responsibilities.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
It can also be an intermediate stage, though.
Â Â  .
This is something I regard as an essential consideration.
Â Â  .
First, we have consolidated our enlargement agenda.
Secondly, we apply rigorous conditionality.
Combined with a credible accession perspective, conditionality works.
Enlargement policy and neighbourhood policy complement each other.
The Commission has always had this view.
Thirdly, we need better communication.
Â Â  .
Instead, we should invest in practical cooperation.
We have a responsibility for neighbouring countries.
It would be an historic mistake.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The politicians too, are distancing themselves from it.
My group can muster little enthusiasm for this proposal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It has set far-reaching goals.
This begs the question: why?
If it enjoys stability, then so do we.
That is the question.
Who decides who will join Europe?
Until recently we said no to Croatia.
Is this the political will of Europe?
They cannot have this special treatment.
These are not logical formulations.
Why do you not call a spade a spade?
This is the logical direction to follow.
We have to be prepared for enlargement.
First and foremost we have to provide the financing.
Let us not, however, be overly dogmatic.
I welcome the reportâs innovativeness and courage.
Indications suggest that Turkish special forces were involved.
The truth is that they want money.
They want yet more money.
Well done, Mr Kuhne!
We should commit to this off our own bat.
The question is deeply political, not bureaucratic.
The role of catalyst belongs to the European Union.
Where, then, do we stand now?
What are we working on?
We did this in our troika meeting.
Let me say something about Ukraine.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Take the energy sector as an example.
This scenario is bad for consumers.
That, too, aggravates the situation in Europe.
I consider that inappropriate.
Â Â  .
A dream scenario or a nightmare?
The first is industrial policy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Protectionism means putting Europe into reverse.
This has also happened in other European countries.
Of course there are asymmetries!
The big operators cannot impose or predetermine these conditions.
The present discussion is astonishing.
The Commission faces challenges on two levels.
Does the fusion benefit consumers?
Does it enhance competition?
I thank you in advance for answering these questions.
MrÂ Radwan made a similar appeal to the Council.
Â Â  .
That is what was decided.
That is basic.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
That is another very important issue.
Â Â  .
No donor has done more to help them.
Support for intercultural dialogue at all levels is important.
That is my intention.
Â Â  .
He stated that no military option exists.
Â Â  .
He now plans to stage a hunger strike.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Targeting that figure means targeting its heart.
I would like to put that question.
This is a live and developing process.
Today we have one.
Commissioner, we have listened to you.
We have noted your conviction and your will.
We Europeans have also been snubbed.
That has been the effect of Jericho.
The future scenario concerns us.
That cannot be done overnight.
The human rights issue has been mentioned many times.
Iran has also been mentioned in this connection.
Â Â  .
Your motion for a resolution is an excellent one.
That is what we want.
We can do our utmost to make things happen.
I also totally agree with Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez.
I believe Barcelona was a success.
The content was good.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Venezuela, Iran und Belarus abstained.
Â Â  .
We have a Human Rights Council!
Â Â  .
1.
The need for a permanent structure/council.
2.
3.
The council should not be too big.
4.
5.
6.
7.
The need for a continued role for NGOs.
8.
We do support the UN in this work.
This is a large step forward.
Not everything is perfect, of course.
I have no need to go on.
These are all entirely positive aspects.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These are five important successes.
That is their contribution.
We naturally welcome the longer lobbying periods in Geneva.
That is part of todayâs agreement.
I wonder whether the US will stand.
The EU must play a key role in this.
That is open to debate.
I actually agree with everything MrÂ Schmidt said.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  .
Since 1993, over 700 names have been registered.
The matter has to be debated first.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I concur with the thrust of his conclusions.
His conclusions are completely justified therefore.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Will the farmer-producer really gain anything by it?
There are 300 new applications pending examination.
Â Â  .
It is a great opportunity for regional producers.
We should be clear on this matter.
According to ...
Quality has its price.
This discriminates against Eastern European Countries.
Therefore, the continuity of tradition was broken.
This had previously been impossible.
The protection of geographical indications is naturally extremely important.
In all honesty, I do not believe so.
The announcement was made today in Ireland.
I would urge them to do so.
There must be no omissions in this regard.
We must proceed very carefully in such situations.
I hope that the Commissioner will take this further.
Â Â  .
Thank you again for the interesting exchange of views.
It is a Codex standard.
So eat more Edam from North Holland!
Mrs Lulling and MrsÂ Salinas GarcÃ­a touched upon that.
However, we have to be very prudent.
We believe that this is a good compromise.
Â Â  â The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
This should be made quite clear at this juncture.
These professions have a special importance and role.
Â Â  .
He presented his views quite clearly.
This approach fully respects the subsidiarity principle.
Finally, there are the internal market rules.
Â Â  .
We must support small legal practices.
Do not make any mistakes.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Our initiative is about better regulation.
What does that mean?
That is what really makes sense.
That is surely a great advantage.
Finally, a word on quality.
A fixed price does not in itself guarantee quality.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are exploiting our ecosystems in an unsustainable way.
Such strategy is no longer suitable.
Clearly this also requires financial investment.
Today is World Consumer Rights Day.
Â Â  .
I want to focus on just two such resources.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
We have not been informed of any meeting.
Â Â  Many thanks.
Your comments have been noted.
Thank you for noting that, Mr President.
Â Â  Many thanks.
Your comments have been noted.
Â Â  Many thanks.
Your comments will be noted.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
We will consider this matter in a separate procedure.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Better use can be made of resources.
Â Â  .
This week I met with iatrogenic patients.
But the budget is a concern.
Â Â  .
As Mr Trakatellis said, that is extremely important.
So, it is over to the Commission.
Â Â  .
There is a good reason for that.
The EU should set stronger priorities for fighting disease.
Let us be consistent in our demands here.
Â Â  .
That is not what we want.
We want to support NGOs that are independent.
What else are they to get?
We do not want that!
That cannot be allowed to continue.
My final point is this.
Cardiac diseases: first cause of death.
Rheumatism: over 150 diseases and syndromes.
Â Â  .
Needless to say, this leads to much frustration.
Â Â  .
No one country can tackle this alone.
We ought to move more in that promising direction.
That is the first point I wanted to make.
Every Member State is adapting their care systems.
Why do we need to re-invent the wheel everywhere?
Why can we not learn from each other?
Attention should go to that area too.
We should call a spade a spade.
Thank you, MrÂ President.
My group will support AmendmentÂ 64.
It is important to acknowledge that as a phenomenon.
It is vital that we close that gap.
The focus is quite clear.
I support Amendment 64 on expanding the financial framework.
I would invite the Commissioner to pool knowledge.
Combine prevention and treatment.
Our citizens want Europe to be effective and transparent.
Where is the health dimension in alcohol policy?
The same applies to chemicals and pesticides.
You can take the opportunity to do so now.
These resources pay for themselves many times over.
For this reason I also support Amendment 64.
I wish to emphasise two priorities.
We have to help the weakest.
I think not quite enough.
I am saying that primarily to the Council.
We are faced with new challenges.
This cross-border factor is certainly one area.
Diseases do not stop at borders.
Knowledge is certainly another factor.
I would like to mention another figure here.
Another point is the whole area of provision.
Â Â  .
I will make a few brief comments.
That is an important issue.
That is in fact what the programme is doing.
Health services fall within the competence of Member States.
There is no question about that.
Patient mobility is an important issue.
We will produce proposals in that respect.
We are promoting that area as well.
I have noted the comments made about pesticides.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at voting time.
I prefer to tell you that straight away.
I shall be obliged to suspend the debate.
Â Â  .
I shall not comment on the amendments separately.
I look forward to a very interesting debate.
Â Â  .
I think we should really stick to it.
1.
2.
That is my suggestion as rapporteur.
Now we have the very same situation again.
We shall now hear from the draftsmen.
His speaking time is three minutes.
I feel a bit like that right now!
I should like to make three points.
We are one big family.
Let us stick to that basic line.
It will resume at 3 p.m. this afternoon.
Seventeen names now follow.
They are the following persons:
Siarhiej MalÄyk
Viktar Sazonau
Vadzim SaranÄukou
Andrej Pisalnik
MikoÅa Lemianouski
Alaksiej Trubkin
SiarÅ¾uk Hudzilin
Jauhien Vaukauviec
AleÅ Äyrejka
Vital Brouka
Vasil LeuÄanka
Tatsiana KlimoviÄ
Dzimitry Å ymanski
Ryhor BakijeviÄ
Anatol LabiedÅºka
Siarhiej Niarouny
Vincuk ViaÄorka
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  .
Rule 151(3) states:
âThe President shall decide whether amendments are admissible.
This is pure nonsense.
Â Â  .
It has been dealt with.
Â Â  That concludes voting time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .I voted in favour of this text.
This poses a real threat.
There are some absurd situations in Europe.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The deadline for compliance is 3Â AprilÂ 2006.
Â Â  .
Today our products are traded all over the world.
This report serves that objective in every respect.
Â Â  .
It is life-enhancing to share culinary traditions.
We have thus chosen to vote against both reports.
Â Â  .
The application process is over-bureaucratic.
Â Â  .
That is not the case.
It must be judged by what it has achieved.
We have therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It was an historic event.
That is something I shall vote against.
The borders cannot be closed.
That would be an historic setback.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Marine biodiversity must be saved from destructive practices.
Europe is in the process of losing another battle.
Â Â  .
That is the reason for our Amendment 55.
The terms of the debate are familiar.
How best to intervene at European level?
However, that is the way it is.
That is not something I shall do, however.
It has torn down borders and opened doors.
Â Â  .
The problem lies elsewhere, however.
Food safety is becoming worse in Europe.
Genetically modified foods are multiplying on the EU market.
Society feels threatened by GMOs.
Perhaps then we would have real consumer protection.
Consumers form the bedrock of a market economy.
This is a matter of great concern to us.
I would like to present a further argument.
Doing so will help us understand our parliamentary business.
Â Â  .
There is a misunderstanding about the agency.
I said a few things about splitting this morning.
I understand Parliamentâs position.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 23Â March 2006.
Â Â  .
It is a ploy aimed at allaying public opinion.
My question is as follows.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is not an ethnic conflict.
Surprise, surprise!
Non-governmental organisations are having particular problems functioning in Transnistria.
That is when the joke turns sour.
We should not forget that piece of history.
The European Parliament must send out clear signals here.
Â Â  .
However, this is the way forward.
Therefore, a lot still remains to be done.
You know that is the case.
That was completely misinterpreted.
Please accept that again as my explanation.
We have to apply pressure to make that happen.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
The official version of the investigation suicide.
We recognise that Kazakhstan's economy is growing rapidly.
It cannot be controlled or partial.
Â Â  .
One thing is for sure.
In a nutshell, we are concerned about Kazakhstan.
Â Â  Mr President, just a brief word.
Thank you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, not everything is pitch-black in Kazakhstan.
These two murders have exacerbated the situation.
A climate of fear also prevails.
It is also a post-communist and post-Soviet country.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It was very comprehensive on economic development.
This is a good step.
Some of you have alluded to that.
One lingering core concern is political freedom.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The many victims demand it.
The situation in Rwanda is not completely comparable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That also has to be said.
I welcome the search for an African solution.
Â Â  .
This is a good step forward.
The committee appears to have quite a strong mandate.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
Â Â  â Impunity is the greatest enemy of justice.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I have an oral amendment.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
This is a time to act calmly and prudently.
Thank you for your applause, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This statement from ETA demonstrates two things.
Firstly, that democracies are right to oppose terrorism.
Â Â  .
Every victim of terrorism is one victim too many.
Certainly it is good to see this ceasefire.
I have experienced this process in Northern Ireland.
The process is possible.
I think it is very good for your region.
Â Â  That concludes the speeches on this subject.
The situation in Belarus is cause for concern.
It will be discussed by the Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert.
This is progress.
That was a mistake.
Politically speaking, that is completely ridiculous!
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Poettering.
I have nearly finished.
We are now collecting 37Â signatures.
That is always good for Parliament.
I still believe that is a good suggestion.
But please conform to the procedures laid down.
(1)
Â Â  .
We have in actual fact made considerable progress.
Admittedly, our task is not complete.
So, what about 2007?
Energy will continue to attract our attention.
The Commission has made progress in this direction.
So what are the next steps?
Â Â  .
What does that mean?
Energy is the fundamental issue.
That is what I want to speak about.
A revised Lisbon Strategy?
Of course!
Fine!
A key challenge!
Unity throughout the House!
Agreed!
Agreed!
Wonderful!
Great!
That is certain!
Your strategic objectives are the right ones.
I expect the Commission to do that.
Â Â  .
I have seen the draft Council conclusions.
Fine words from such faint hearts!
Europe deserves better.
Thirdly, there is the issue of energy.
No, it has not.
Â Â  .
The Commission must be open with people.
Let us see what is behind the advice.
Tell us how you use taxpayersâ money.
Show some confidence in people.
May I also thank the President for quoting Montesquieu.
The worldwide process of globalisation is inevitable.
We do not have a financial perspective, either.
It is much the same with education.
I fully support you on that.
You mentioned Montesquieu, and someone else wanted Machiavelli.
There are no clues.
Perhaps it is now time for Plan B.
Factories are leaving Europe for other countries.
What does this mean?
It means increased unemployment.
It means increased redundancies.
It therefore means a worse life.
It means increased prices.
Â Â  â I like Portugal and the Portuguese.
I mean the very big thing.
Look across the wide ocean!
We have 62Â priorities in this splendid new document.
Â Â  .
I am sorry, but this is not true.
Let no one be in any doubt about this.
This is easier on some issues than others.
Mr Swoboda mentioned my meeting with President Putin.
Hopefully these ideas will make a worthwhile contribution.
I got used to it during the British Presidency.
They are agreements .
Let us be frank.
I want to be clear about this.
The Commission supports the most ambitious possible agreement.
There is light at the end of the tunnel!
In first place is the constitutional question.
In second place is the important issue of employment.
However, that is the small print.
Montesquieu has been quoted.
These things are simply incomprehensible and inconsistent.
Let me give you a simple example.
Recently a delegation of Lithuanian lecturers paid a visit.
Everywhere they were given the same information.
But all work is duplicated.
The Lithuanian lecturers were quite astonished.
I think this strategy is quite good.
Â Â  .
We therefore listen to you very carefully.
The Commission will not interfere with that.
Perhaps we can make some progress.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The world has moved on a little since then.
This is absolutely essential.
Nuclear energy springs to my mind in that context.
Â Â  .
It comes at a good time.
We are also active as regards international instruments.
So much on the question of energy saving.
This is also creating opportunities for our economies.
Â Â  .
We have significant support from citizens.
All three should interact.
That is also crucial for security of supply.
The Union is strong when there is solidarity.
Then there is the issue of the energy mix.
Parliament has debated the Green Paper on energy efficiency.
The energy community should be expanded.
Â Â  .
We want growth and employment.
Â Â  .
We are not using existing technology.
Â Â  .
Will they discuss energy?
No, that is not the question!
In other words, we need new partnerships.
Â Â  .
There is no other solution which is as simple.
How many are there, and which are they?
Energy is essential to every country.
What lessons can we learn about security of supply?
We should not mix them up.
The time has come to move beyond declarations.
By how much?
It is important in talks with the wider world.
It is inadequate.
He should be putting it to the British Government.
Nothing is achieved this way.
How should this be achieved?
We have long experience in this area.
Why would those countries then not be cut off?
I wholeheartedly agree with that.
These are European objectives of a Community energy policy.
We need a realistic and sensible debate.
We have a duty also to use modern technology.
The same applies to energy.
I have no major reservations with that.
The single European energy market does not work.
We need to develop the common European energy policy.
It needs a lot of work by Parliament.
The resolution omits this.
Who would suffer?
Germany?
Commissioners of the split Union?
This morning, MrsÂ Morgan spoke about Katrina.
I think three things are decisive.
We need an efficient expansion of renewable energy.
Enough of asymmetry, enough of rogues.
Will we be able to do this?
Â Â  .
That has been stressed by a number of speakers.
MrÂ Goebbels and CommissionerÂ Piebalgs both referred to solidarity.
That much we can already say.
Mrs Ek mentioned the need to maintain competition.
Â Â  .
We face as big a challenge as he did.
However, we should also have courage.
We do.
This is the key to success.
This is crucial.
Solidarity is extremely important.
There is a lot of emotion about national champions.
Debate will always make emotions stronger.
New technologies are definitely necessary.
The price of oil is actually stimulating development.
We must help ourselves.
The market will then provide what is asked for.
Thank you very much for your debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  .
But they should be available.
We see no reason to question the Congolese assessment.
I have already mentioned the police mission.
Â Â  .
What should our answer be?
First, there must be a clear time limit.
We need a formal invitation from the interim government.
Will European security and defence policy prove credible?
Â Â  .
We remain to be convinced.
So what is the point of sending these troops?
In part, small-minded prejudices are involved here.
These elections are a moment of hope.
It is a request to which we should agree.
The Council then came to this conclusion:
I can only repeat what I have already said.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  .
These are not unimportant caveats.
Time is of the essence.
That surely cannot be in our interest.
A difference of EUR 2Â billion is not chicken-feed.
Â Â  .
Promises were in fact made in 2005.
Â Â  .
The subject of my second remark deeply perplexes me.
What sort of partnership is this?
However, the problems involved are the same.
The exact figures have already been mentioned several times.
That requires very careful examination.
The debate is closed.
It is an enormous waste of human life.
That derogation expires in December 2006.
He is still there today.
Having just visited Kiev, I can confirm that.
A compromise must be reached as soon as possible.
Their human rights are being profoundly violated by Britain.
That is a that we Polish Members oppose.
Many MEPs can only access Strasbourg via Frankfurt.
The assistance, however, has now been withdrawn.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The European Parliament cannot wish to remove these values.
Tomorrow, I have a seminar on East Africa.
In conclusion, then, I thank you.
Â Â  .
Finally, there are the financial aspects.
Scope for that already exists under current WTO rules.
Â Â  .
Market access remains absolutely central as an issue.
All these are major priorities for the ACP.
I should like to ask the Commissioner one question.
Will the Commissioner act upon these proposals?
Â Â  .
The ACP countries also have extremely weak economies.
Why, I would like to know?
I regard that as pure cynicism.
I urge you to reject these amendments tomorrow.
The general philosophy of this text is right.
A few priorities must be stated.
The importance of development cooperation must not be underestimated.
Perhaps you feel that there is too little information.
There is no diktat in that.
There is a problem about transparency in his management.
We work in tandem, therefore.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
The report also includes some other proposals.
We need a genuine European party statute.
In many countries political foundations exist for that purpose.
Our young people represent our future.
The report take us a significant step further forward.
Â Â  .
We fully share this view.
They concern the role of the European Foundation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
But the real choices we face are policy choices.
That is essential for our Union to work effectively.
We already have ten parties registering.
That shows that this system is working.
This of course is not the case.
Â Â  .
They are right: there is not one.
There is no such thing as European public opinion.
I have made a few amendments to that effect.
The parties are never anything other than artificial.
That is indefensible.
Do not kid yourselves!
I address this to Mr Allister and Mr Bonde.
That is the reality.
We have to do much more.
Why?
Why?
We lament the lack of a European public opinion.
I congratulate him.
We hear that everywhere.
What is the cause of this erosion?
The challenge is clear for all to see.
I therefore propose that we endorse the report.
Other political parties should be doing the same.
Â Â  .
That goes for the European level as well.
European political parties are a very important element.
This is a very important debate.
That is certainly not the custom in this House.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
This report is about European civil law.
We have come to a very critical stage.
From our perspective, this should involve two processes.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  Many thanks, MrÂ Krarup.
No protests were forthcoming from the House.
Â Â  .
We urge the Belarusian authorities to release them immediately.
The Commission is now considering the issue of sanctions.
Â Â  .
Madam President, todayâs debate is important.
This is a very good sign.
We owe this to our Belarusian partners.
Â Â  .
That is the situation we are facing.
Â Â  .
That is the truth of the matter.
Â Â  .
He goes through the charade only.
Â Â  â Thank you Madam President.
For us this will be unacceptable.
Nobody is deluding himself by anything.
We cannot come up with excuses.
Thank you.
We have to enhance our actions in this field.
Firstly, we must not accept the election results.
I took on the challenge.
I saw petty smugglers.
We all agree on this.
That is exactly what we need now.
Smart sanctions have been mentioned.
That is a most regrettable state of affairs.
That is indeed important.
We shall endeavour to do that.
Â Â  .
We also have to support NGOs.
The debate here was quite encouraging.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is an unquestionable success.
Â Â  .
Retirement now comprises one third of the human lifespan.
Immigration is only a partial solution.
What can be done to redress the situation?
Â Â  .
The status quo is not an option.
A large proportion of Europe is getting older.
With rare exceptions, birth rates are low.
Moreover, active ageing should be encouraged.
Â Â  .
That is surely solidarity between the generations.
Â Â  .
I call for a change in priorities.
This issue is much more multifaceted than we think.
That is where we politicians come in again.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur.
Mr Bushill-Matthews has prepared a much-needed report.
This report should just be a starting point.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The Member States face significant demographic challenges.
Countries then learn from each other.
Â Â  .
There can be a lot of flexibility.
I think there is a big future for that.
This is a very great bonus.
We have an exciting time in front of us.
Â Â  .
Cohesion policy can also play an important role.
This must be carefully monitored.
This is again something that we must monitor carefully.
Many thanks and sincere congratulations to the rapporteur.
Â Â  .
I hail from the rural German of Lower Saxony.
There are some inconsistencies here.
Yes, we do.
Â Â  .
Nonetheless, there remain some questions.
In other words, we will all be winners.
I believe that we must not miss this opportunity.
The EU should financially support that endeavour.
We clearly need a joined-up approach by various departments.
We still need more jobs in rural areas.
Â Â  .
We have a lot of work ahead of us.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Could you please slow down?
Â Â  As regards my timetable, I can reassure you.
After
âmanagement expenditure forâ
the following phrase:
Â Â  Are there any objections to this oral amendment?
I believe these are the recognised terms.
The text would then read as follows:
Â Â  Are there any objections to this oral amendment?
Â Â  .
Â Â  Are there any objections to this oral amendment?
Â Â  .
I would ask the House to adopt the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Are there any objections to this oral amendment?
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Accordingly, Israel needs our undivided support.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Some of the figures paint a very clear picture:
Thanks to Brussels!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have thus voted against the resolution.
Â Â  .
Africa is a most appetising fruit.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
Nor should it be.
The Congolese Government has not requested it.
We therefore voted against the resolution.
Pensioners, take a stand!
I also think it is not necessary.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .The European political parties are merely extremely lucrative organisations.
For what purpose though?
We are therefore voting against this report.
Â Â  .
Long live pensioners!
Families with several children are virtually seen as antisocial.
Neither will be accepted in any case.
We owe it to the future generations of Europeans.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The world is growing older.
Â Â  .
Europe is facing an unprecedented demographic problem.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I support the Parish report.
Hundreds of jobs will be lost.
Â Â  .
Hence my abstention.
Â Â  .
We have chosen to vote against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Â Â  .
Thank you very much.
Â Â  At the moment we are talking about tendencies.
Can we vote on tendencies?
I shall pass it on.
There are a great many victims, including children.
The repression is extremely violent.
Â Â  I am delighted that that has been cleared up.
The title should be totally unambiguous.
(1)
Older workers will see young people as their competitors.
That will also be their fatal error.
Recently the Constitutional Treaty was voted down.
This situation must be prevented from escalating further.
Â Â  Mr Mavrommatis, your complaint is extremely reasonable.
This reflects credit on the work we did there.
Romano Prodi is our man thereâ.
It should be thoroughly investigated.
The European Parliament should conduct its own investigation.
Â Â  All suggestions must be treated with respect.
Is that your proposal?
This will devastate those two market towns.
Therefore the European does not apply there.
It is about time we saw that happening.
Some of them remain in prison to this day.
Europe too is losing its food security.
Â Â  We have reached the end of the speeches.
That delays the debates.
Â Â  .
Rumours are one thing and facts are another.
That is not possible.
It is the border of Europe.
Malta must be a transit country.
I call on you all to support Malta.
Â Â  .
However, what we saw in Malta was terrible.
The conditions of detention are inhuman and degrading.
Asylum seekers are not criminals.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I believe that that is truly excessive.
This, moreover, is the tragedy.
What is this practical and urgent action?
MrÂ President, Parliament is speaking.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Malta cannot perform miracles on its own.
What do you think about this proposal?
That is what we should like to know today.
We do, emphatically, need financial aid.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
So that is the main challenge.
The Commission has already promised financial aid.
We will provide it quickly.
We will continue to work on joint patrols.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The trans-European networks are part of that.
This clearly shows how European funds are being used.
I can thus fully support the agreement reached.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The free market also means the freedom to speculate.
Because this is really what this controversy is about.
Yet let us not be surprised about anything afterwards.
Perhaps the coordinators could do something about this.
This is urgently needed as well.
This is not right.
I consider this wholly insufficient.
This market is the second largest in the world.
Â Â  .
One very important precondition is cooperation between Member States.
But there are two stages.
So that is one stage.
Then there is conformity.
The new package addresses the conformity issue.
So that is not the end of the story.
I know that the challenge is huge.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Overall, the Directorate-General for Competition has behaved admirably.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
During 2004, the Commission completed its modernisation package.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Many in my constituency are now almost destitute.
These are grounds here for a real investigation.
My second remark concerns the Mittal-Arcelor affair.
The Commissioner is doing a good job.
Â Â  .
Yet we badly need that type of investment.
Why?
It is a question of the competitiveness of Europe.
I really appreciate your interest in competition policy.
It is about two-way traffic.
He is indeed the advisor.
Mrs BerÃ¨s mentioned Mittalâs bid for Arcelor.
We will be looking at that.
It should be combated.
For that we need a united Europe.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
Â Â  .
The Council currently has a credibility problem.
The reality is very different, however.
Public opinion is caught up in strictly national debates.
If not now, then when?
The ball is in the Councilâs court.
Please open up your doors.
We Europeans want to participate.
Â Â  .
There are different approaches to openness and transparency.
We come from different traditions.
The arguments have been won.
Let us take on the anti-Europeans.
Let us promote our institutions.
Let us celebrate what we do.
They can and must be.
In 2004 we published our evaluation report.
The Constitution requires new legislation in this area.
RecommendationÂ 3 talks about documents classified as confidential.
Here too we are in danger of confusing matters.
In our experience, the framework agreement operates well.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It does not have to be like that.
(No!)
Why is it delicate?
Â Â  .
This renders democratic control over decision-making impossible.
Â Â  .
We have been speaking of openness today.
Indeed, we agree with this.
Secondly, we have a right of oversight.
Our use of experts is a public matter.
The alternative would be opinions of reduced quality.
Information given out in confidence must be respected.
I have every confidence in MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m.
A lot remains to be done in this area.
Where is the Council?
It is because they lock themselves in their rooms.
Why do they not open their doors?
But that is not enough.
He said that the Commission is an unelected government.
Would you like it to be elected?
I am going to abandon Mr Knapman now.
We want the Council to legislate in public.
I have run out of time.
I have several points.
My second point concerns the opening-up of Council meetings.
My next point is about Coreper.
That debate should be in public.
This can indeed be the course of European unification.
There are plenty of words, but no deeds.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I cannot see why the Council cannot do likewise.
Â Â  .
There has to be simultaneous movement now.
They are not.
That is a matter of common sense.
They should only do two-thirds of what we do.
We need to continue to work for trade justice.
Mr Lamy has a crucial role to play there.
Â Â  .
Everyone benefits from fair rules in trade.
Â Â  .
This affects financial sectors in particular.
We are very competitive in this area.
What we need is fair trading conditions.
Â Â  .
The time has come to move ahead.
There is a gorgeous lake in Geneva.
Â Â  .
Yet lessons were not learned.
Â Â  .
It is quite astonishing.
I have several points.
I think it raises key issues.
We find ourselves in a very tricky situation.
Will Geneva happen?
How will it work out?
The first is that of geographical indications of origin.
Bilateral agreements always benefit the stronger party.
Then there is agriculture.
I have two proposals and one remark to make.
Â Â  .
Thank you for not shooting the messenger!
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Committee on Fisheries has not done so yet.
(1)
Â Â  .
(2)
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Over the last year, this has been achieved.
A final point.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Firstly, why a report?
What can we do in order to be heard?
The United States are ahead of us.
My colleague has expressed this very well.
In the field of investment: trans-European networks.
It would take twenty years to finish them.
Â Â  .
Of what has this updating consisted?
Three broad areas.
Where is Europe-wide discussion of it being guided?
Childcare is one of the core issues.
Â Â  .
I believe that we must stress three basic points.
We want Guideline No 22 to be deleted.
Â Â  .
Competition can actually have a harmonising effect.
Â Â  .
Well, let us do that.
Of course you will not.
You have been warned!
The description is very succinct, but very hypocritical.
Firstly, there is the question of youth unemployment.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President.
I support the rapporteur's proposals in this respect.
It actually represents a tremendous opportunity.
In Greece alone, we need one million.
Can we promise them?
We cannot promise them.
Europe cannot safeguard these jobs.
They will live on unemployment benefits.
We have no energy of our own.
That is the reality.
Even they are Chinese.
Farmers are suffering.
The consequences of this approach are markedly negative.
All kinds of obstacles must be eliminated.
I shall comment on just a few of them.
We now have more than 20Â million unemployed.
We need those jobs, as Commissioner Å pidla said.
Please be consistent, look at our amendments.
Look at Amendment 2, for example.
Read our Amendment 5 as well.
The Unionâs energy dependency is unsustainable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
On the contrary!
We also submitted proposals for compromises with the report.
Â Â  .
What is this fear about?
What should the answer be?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What do we find?
You were right.
The opposite is actually the case.
Economic migration is restricted.
That has indeed, already happened.
Where is the justice in that?
Such cases are quite unacceptable.
These restrictions must be fully lifted.
Many of us here do not find them convincing.
We need to encourage them to do that.
We must combat this strongly.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten mentioned the restrictions placed on social security.
This is particularly true of paragraphÂ 1.
Why do they make social security dependent on nationality?
That was shown to be absurd.
Is that not protectionism?
With a great deal of difficulty.
We have no minimum wage in Denmark.
My second point concerns equal treatment.
That, moreover, is the way things are.
Allow me to reiterate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â We shall look into it, Mr Heaton-Harris.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â That concludes voting time.
We have therefore voted against these amendments.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the Laperrouze report.
Â Â  .
Unfortunately the majority in Parliament rejected our proposals.
Â Â  .
The dish proposed tries to please everyone.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We therefore voted against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
All negotiations require a certain level of confidentiality.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Take the example of services.
Â Â  .
I voted for a similar amendment today.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What has happened in the name of globalisation?
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The future is not necessarily anything to fear.
Yet most European governments appear fearful.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We know that a balance can be struck.
Â Â  .
We hope that people will come to realise this.
What a shame!
Sometimes, we opt for the latter.
We supported the proposal at first reading.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
For the time being, the danger is elsewhere.
I am fully in support of that.
It was a compromise.
If you read it, it certainly is not.
This will therefore need to be examined more closely.
I have a few questions and comments.
I shall start with you, Commissioner McCreevy.
What do you mean?
Is it a directive?
I have a question, though.
Why have you issued a communication, Commissioner Å pidla?
Why did you not decide to adapt legislation instead?
PresidentÂ Barroso has taken his troops in hand.
Nothing has changed.
Â Â  .
I shall reply to some of the specific questions.
It is a good proposal.
So I think Parliament has clearly shown the way.
Â Â  .
Silence is equivalent to assent.
The debate is closed.
I should like to give some examples of that.
Â Â  .
You know it all went horribly wrong.
The Netherlands said no, which is worrying.
How can we achieve this?
We can do it by making them more transparent.
Some are good, and some are not.
That is what is missing.
This need not be done by a weighty authority.
More transparency is needed in that area too.
Â Â  .
They are justified by impact assessments.
Let us be clear.
That is not the right way forward.
Let me give you an example.
The second issue has to do with impact assessment.
I will start with simplification.
Let me conclude by adding something about transparency.
Â Â  .
Our legislative activity is a continuous process.
How do we perceive this challenge?
All of these measures are now producing tangible results.
Let us look at impact assessment.
I believe it is real progress.
We know there is room for improvement.
We are working on a comprehensive approach.
This is a high priority for the Commission.
We analysed 2055 cases of infringements.
That was the decision of the Commission today.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What are we working on behind the simplification?
Â Â  .
He should add terrorism to that list.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is really welcome.
But we have to take care.
Impact assessment cannot displace political decision making.
Â Â  .
I agree with much of what MrsÂ Wallis says.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That, however, is an obvious message.
I personally am sceptical on this point.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The citizensâ complaints are not symbolic in nature.
I am in any case grateful for your understanding.
That will help improve our lawmaking processes.
We have three linked issues in this plenary session.
I will just read you the language.
I think there is a communication problem here.
There are many more examples.
Out-of-date legislation can be repealed.
A number of speakers refer to the European Constitution.
The directive on services is a case in point.
Who is mistaken?
Perhaps nobody is?
I wholeheartedly support the idea behind it.
We do what we can to adopt sound legislation.
What is it all about?
Next, it passes to the Council.
In theory, the Council is composed of ministers.
What is to be done then?
Thank you.
This is a serious political challenge.
That is not what this is about.
We need to know what we are doing.
That is why we had to do something.
I would once more solicit Parliamentâs support.
Let us not fool ourselves, however.
No one is denying that modernisation is needed there.
It will always be a matter of judgment.
We are discussing the best possible solution.
It is truly a highly political exercise.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
This is the responsibility of the legislation process itself.
This loophole was filled by the draft Constitution.
The following questions have been submitted to the Commission.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I hope that you will convey that message.
It truly has to be risk-sensitive compliance.
Â Â  .
The levels of risk should be assessed.
That is clearly set out in the directive.
Â Â  .
That will apply equally to Bulgaria and Romania.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The procedures must be followed.
It would be an abuse of privilege.
I do not think anybody would advocate that.
We have to live by what is there.
Â Â  .
Allow me to quote directly from the Directive.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
But on top of that comes a political concern.
We have some financial instruments, which are restricted.
Â Â  .
It is a very difficult question.
The Council cut it drastically at its December meeting.
Negotiations are currently being held in the trialogue.
Â Â  .
The level of budget is extremely important.
But it is also important to reach agreement.
We do care.
That is my understanding.
If so, under what conditions?
If so, under what conditions?
Â Â  .
The total amount was more than EURÂ 655Â million.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Questions 48 to 59 will be answered in writing.
Are these statements accurate?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you for your response to my question.
Â Â  .
That is the situation.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Commissioner, I wanted to ask about inflation.
Only two countries did not exceed the index.
Â Â  .
We cannot therefore ignore them or amend them.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you, Commissioner, for your response.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have discussed this issue.
That concludes questions to the Commission.
Â Â  .
It contains four Actions.
Citizensâ projects also come under Action 1.
This is also a very important Action.
They mainly relate to Action 4, active remembrance.
Â Â  .
All the previously mentioned characteristics apply to this organisation.
An amendment by the committee proposed deleting this reference.
Â Â  .
Will it really make a difference?
This is why the programme is of key importance.
Â Â  .
The Councilâs parsimony does it no credit.
Of course they are not.
It is still not too late.
Promotion of active European citizenship should be increased.
European integration policy is failing.
No programme for citizenship can resolve this divorce.
I would have gone much further.
My final question relates to the problem of memory.
There cannot be any other criteria.
Each person brings his or her memories to Europe.
Fascism was an example of totalitarianism.
It was also European.
Â Â  .
We should preserve the evidence of these crimes.
The Takkula report is good.
Crimes are and remain crimes.
Â Â  .
One, two, three.
What did you hear?
Absolutely nothing!
Are there demands to do something?
No!
No, again.
So here we go again!
This is pay-as-you-go citizenship.
The price rises as your rights go.
Why?
Without truth, there can be no reconciliation.
Malta is a beautiful island.
However, we cannot keep selective memories alive.
These indicators are also similar in the European Union.
This will prevent any recurrence of such regimes.
Other concomitant measures are needed, however.
The committee decided against it.
Congratulations on your good work.
Stalinismâs twin brother was Nazism.
I condemn all forms of totalitarianism.
I support every bit of it.
I have lived in Brussels for seven years.
Those are the national prototypes that we have.
I can support each and every one of them.
I would ask the Commissioner to incorporate our proposals.
It is not appropriate to use the term Stalinism.
Â Â  .
Regarding finance, we are in negotiations.
The last point concerns the title.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday.
Â Â  .
Consequently, we now have a partnership system.
This new draft makes the panel more democratic.
How do the cities reflect it?
I receive such letters, just like everyone else.
I think this is something we all do.
As you can see, Italians are operative.
The celebrations have had both positive and negative consequences.
Nonetheless, I thank Mrs Prets for her work.
I shall give you the reasons for my position.
That would have encouraged them to shoulder their responsibilities.
Culture amounts to more than just publicity events.
I do not have time to go into detail.
I am now addressing CommissionerÂ FigeÄ¾ in particular.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The list is very long.
They also have very long half-lives.
Others would cite a much higher figure.
It was the only equitable and honourable outcome.
Â Â  .
We have a result we can be proud of.
The curtailment of f-gases constitutes a major step.
Greenhouse gases must be reduced as much as possible.
We made our views clear at first reading.
Â Â  .
We have still not received a response.
That is not a criticism of the rapporteur.
We see two problems with this compromise.
This situation is completely unacceptable.
Austria and Denmark have acted consistently.
I call on you to rectify this error.
There are no reassuring signals.
Alternatives do exist.
History will not be kind in judging such action.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The Council will be here tomorrow.
The Commissioner may respond today.
CommissionerÂ FigeÄ¾, would you like to add anything?
Â Â  .
What is not environmentally friendly is not economically sound.
You can be confident that we mean it.
That is all I can say at the moment.
Â Â  .
Is that true?
Â Â  .
I know of no differences.
We will continue in accordance with it.
I do not know about them.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  .
That has now been achieved.
We hope this happens without further delay.
I know it was difficult.
We have no more time to lose.
Â Â  .
First among them is the revision clause.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is the positive aspect of the situation.
The figures speak for themselves.
Â Â  .
Nobody sensible would indulge in it.
Everything is done to avoid spending!
Â Â  Thank you very much to everybody who has spoken.
That concludes this item.
Â Â  .
Our presidency has set itself very definite objectives.
That brings me to the budget.
Â Â  .
The message emerging from the European Council is clear.
We now have monitoring mechanisms.
We have 25 national reform programmes.
There is no room for nationalistic reflexes.
We can win the globalisation battle.
We are also working hard on health services.
We will take this work forward swiftly.
Good.
That was important in terms of consistency.
We are now moving in the right direction.
We are putting words into action.
That is our duty.
We should do more to achieve it.
That is our shared responsibility.
Please allow me to reiterate this point.
The European Parliament is playing its part in this.
That is a good sign.
Â Â  .
Congratulations to the Austrians for avoiding a row.
The European Union is remarkably resilient.
You need three Councils a year.
That is hardly the action of a pro-European party.
Â Â  .
We need instruments and resources first, however.
I believe that this is an important point.
I should therefore like to propose a challenge.
Â Â  .
What, then, is happening today?
I am grateful for your support.
That is quite crucial.
The first has to do with research into energy.
Just take a look at the results.
They are superficial throughout and above all hypocritical.
That did not happen, however.
Why is that?
Much more must be done, however.
The Commission and the Council must follow this path.
Good luck!
Do you believe that European citizens feel the same?
The problems are already incalculable as it is.
Let us face facts, however.
Thank you very much.
Thirdly, I shall comment on the energy policy.
But what happened?
I agree.
This will lead to economic growth and increased employment.
How can such decisions be justified?
More and more targeted sanctions are needed.
Should we actually be setting ourselves targets?
Â Â  .
To some extent we already work in team presidencies.
These points were positive.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote.
This calendar has been introduced without any such debate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is what I did.
It adds totality.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
We have been discussing this issue here.
Thank you for being here with us.
You have the floor.
Our journey towards membership was not easy.
The aspect of timing was a legitimate concern.
Let us not waste it.
We often speak of the lack of such leadership.
Let me cite a few examples:
Naturally, size also matters.
The European Union increases the influence of small countries.
We need to adopt a holistic attitude.
Our Euro-Mediterranean policy is a clear example of this.
It is a common challenge requiring a collective effort.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
This is a gross waste of public funds.
British taxpayers deserve to have value for money.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The aforesaid sum is already too generous.
We have therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  .
They must also become more efficient and cost-effective.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
There was a misunderstanding yesterday.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
That is why I voted against this report.
Â Â  .
Hence our decision to abstain.
We have chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  .
I welcome these positive benefits.
Â Â  .
The reverse is true in practice, though.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We view this as an unsustainable situation.
We must continue to work within the Quartet.
Why rigour?
Â Â  .
That will take some time.
Only a negotiated settlement will be sustainable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let us seize this opportunity.
So, the situation looks pretty bleak.
We send our best wishes to both sides.
Â Â  .
It is the same water.
Who wins?
No one!
Let us consider some examples: avian influenza.
If it affects Gaza, then it affects Israel.
It is not possible.
Not even Israel can do that.
Â Â  .
This policy is irresponsible.
East Jerusalem is surrounded!
Â Â  .
Which common foreign and security policy is that?
Thinking about Gaza, Israel did not negotiate there.
The withdrawal of troops alone cannot guarantee that.
Kadima and the Labour Party might represent an opportunity.
Taken overall, this situation looks extremely worrying.
The Talibanisation of Palestine is cause for concern.
We can derive two main facts from this description.
It is not creating a viable Palestinian state.
Both provide very important commitments to the way forward.
We therefore need a long-term strategy.
Â Â  .
Secondly, humanitarian aid is absolutely necessary.
We are working on this.
Naturally, we also have to support Mahmoud Abbas.
He is the interlocutor at present.
There are quite a number of these factors.
Â Â  .
New people have appeared as leaders.
What does that mean?
I would very much like to insist on that.
Now, does it open possibilities?
Let me believe that it opens possibilities.
Are we going to use those possibilities?
We have seen that already.
It was not possible to disengage from Gaza unilaterally.
That is something really sad.
Mr Cohn-Bendit has changed.
I have changed.
How many people in this chamber have changed?
In the future, yes, we can change.
That has to be reciprocal too.
This is not negotiation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  What has actually happened with the elections?
Sharonâs legacy contains three tasks:
Â Â  .
I should like to emphasise that point here.
The Council will continue to do this.
Â Â  .
This is very important for the future.
Unfortunately, this was exactly what we had expected.
I express my admiration for their courage.
We have made this known.
We must see what can be done.
The Commission is involved in the preparations.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is an important conclusion to draw.
That is the first point I wanted to make.
We must constantly follow the developments in that country.
Â Â  .
Will a visa ban be imposed on them too?
Economic gain is thus the objective.
Many congratulations on this achievement!
They must go on the list.
The media is controlled by the Lukashenko regime.
The people of Belarus must not be isolated.
Â Â  .
We should not wait for future elections.
Belarusians are an exceptionally peaceful and patient people.
We in Europe should now send the right signals.
This is not the case at all.
I simply wish to make one point.
Additional charges have been imposed.
We need to go much further.
This House will help.
He was not given any democratic legitimacy.
Who is Mr Lukashenko today?
All the world is to be warned about it.
But nobody knows what might happen there any day.
Moreover, we should go further.
International pressure must also be increased.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That flexibility will be continued over the coming years.
The media project was mentioned.
We will have to continue with that.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The international observers agreed with this.
Â Â  .
That pretty much covers everything.
Â Â  .
We must now reward that irreversible process.
Â Â  .
They won their battle for a better country.
That was the start of their battle for peace.
We can rejoice in a job well done.
What of the future?
Ukraine needs a strong coalition and stable government.
Here above all our moral support is needed.
We have to help Ukraine rejoin the European family.
That must not be allowed to happen.
Â Â  .
I fully support what the previous speaker just said.
The European Union plays a key role in this.
The question now arising is: what next?
What more can we do to help Ukraine?
Â Â  .
We are ready to do so.
The next step is to develop greater cooperation.
We should therefore hold out our hand to them.
Â Â  .
I cannot be any more precise.
We are very pleased with these elections.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
To save 25Â 000 lives!
What stage are we at with this?
In 2005, we still recorded 41Â 600 deaths.
When are they actually to debate with us?
Road safety is not the heart of the matter.
This problem was raised with the Costa report.
It is high time we discussed it.
There were rumours it would be in April.
Now they are saying the end of the year.
After four years that is no longer tolerable.
Yes or no?
We believe they should be.
Â Â  .
We have now also started to draft fresh legislation.
We are still waiting for this communication.
Â Â  .
This strikes me as the key point.
While we wait, reality moves on.
This system must be regulated differently.
That is what I want to comment about.
We are not talking only about aviation.
After all, that is what Parliament wanted.
But that would be the wrong approach.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We will take the following questions to the Council.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you very much for a helpful reply.
After all, this is not a new problem.
Â Â  .
The situation is still not satisfactory.
Yes!
Â Â  .
You mentioned the re-education camps.
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office.
You ask what more we can do.
Â Â  .
I think we are on the right track.
We are making progress.
Â Â  .
There are also a host of other Community rules.
The regulations are clear.
The Council has no powers here.
Â Â  I would like to pose a more philosophical question.
Â Â  .
I would answer your question like this.
We are given the opportunity to comment on that.
Â Â  .
It is certainly a matter that we regularly raise.
Will we give it an escape route?
Â Â  .
There is a clear procedure that is moving forward.
There is not always unanimity there.
Have you replied clearly?
Â Â  .
It is a question of whether obligations are satisfied.
These obligations must be satisfied.
We will therefore continue to pursue this case closely.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I can answer this question very briefly.
I fully agree with the honourable Member.
Â Â  .
We question directly and there are two questions:
Â Â  .
Human rights violations are raised whenever they occur.
That is the answer we need.
Â Â  .
You mentioned the Supreme Court.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
At the moment it is not.
I shall discuss this matter within the Council.
What progress has been made in implementing this project?
How will it be financed?
There is no other way.
Two other links are at the planning stage.
Â Â  . â It is like I have already said.
He has therefore ended up with EURÂ 7.3Â billion.
Something has to be done about this.
I am sent here by people to ask questions.
There are 700 of us.
Â Â  I am really sorry.
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  .
The causes of this crisis are complex.
Â Â  .
And why is it our fault?
That is an unethical, immoral imbalance.
Europe has 15 times higher a ratio.
Sub-Saharan Africa is short of one million health workers.
Â Â  .
Put your money where your mouth is.
Make poverty history!
Â Â  .
The result is devastating.
Â Â  .
Their first need is to be safe.
They leave in frustration.
We must address this problem urgently.
This brings me to my last point.
The chances of them coming back are extremely slim.
Countries are losing the most qualified and experienced nurses.
Cooperation primarily means âbrain drainâ.
The financial resources have already been mentioned.
The reverse is true.
Health workers need to be properly trained.
I should like to make three main points.
This is purely down to a lack of personnel.
Who is bearing the brunt of this?
Another four million children die from diarrhoea or pneumonia.
But not all is bleak.
Many of the solutions are cheap and low-tech.
This is certainly true of public health.
And the long list could be continued.
Therefore this should be eliminated as soon as possible.
I should like to select four European issues.
Educated doctors and nurses save human lives.
I would like to talk about the Roma.
So the problems are first-hand and they are all-pervasive.
I was in Malawi last year.
We must not do nothing.
I hope we achieve this.
Â Â  .
Most Commission financing is allocated through country programming.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
We are all affected either directly or indirectly.
That is why we are here tonight.
We have already acted.
We are now taking a first step.
We are filling the legal gap.
There is no time to waste.
Â Â  .
We have some five billion chickens in the EU.
Therefore it is possible to take production out.
These measures will balance out market supply and demand.
Community and national aid must be given at once.
Poultry producers are therefore enduring difficult times.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There are lessons to be learnt from this crisis.
It is essential to introduce exceptional measures.
Practice has varied to date.
We need to be consistent.
The poultry sector has very specific characteristics.
I sympathise with the Commission.
It is an extremely difficult balance.
There is a huge gap in consumer knowledge.
We need to manage the stocks.
Swift and decisive action is needed.
That is the only way to win this battle.
Partial financing will achieve nothing.
Decisive action at European level is called for.
The same happened in the case of foot-and-mouth disease.
There is not enough money?
The European Union is not an insurance company.
That is the European Unionâs only option.
What action, though, can it take?
We have an excellent Commissioner.
I fully agree with the proposal of the Commission.
Â Â  .
But ultimately I leave it to the Member States.
Nor can I support AmendmentÂ 7 on export refunds.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The Austrian Presidency has already responded to us.
The EDF surplus also poses a problem.
What does the future hold for the EDF?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
In that we cannot invest enough.
I find that rather odd.
My own government talked about EURÂ 230 million.
How can that be sensible?
We have work in progress.
It would perhaps be worth testing this option.
Â Â  .
We have had this discussion before.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Corruption is an enormous problem on a worldwide scale.
That state of affairs must change.
Â Â  .
Corruption is indeed a major obstacle to development.
It hits the poorest in developing countries the hardest.
Those procedures are often a source of corruption.
My last point concerns our colleagues in the field.
Delegations can check that aid is properly used.
Â Â  .
We also need to deregulate.
Regulation is the mother of corruption.
We are on the right track.
Â Â  .
The scourge of corruption is neither new nor rare.
Not very, I am afraid.
Is a simple declaration of interest really good enough?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There is a need for more transparency.
They know where this money is coming from.
We also have to examine ourselves.
We cannot just blame African people.
Corruption is a serious threat to development.
I congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report.
Some Members have mentioned the global problem of corruption.
That is the one message.
Sometimes parliaments are the problem.
I accept that.
We can encourage that.
There we saw women voting to elect other women.
I would like to offer two examples.
Firstly, European Union aid to the Palestinian Self-Government.
Secondly, the Commission sends humanitarian aid to Chechnya.
Member States must ratify the UN anti-corruption convention.
I am glad the representative supports that course.
Corruption restricts the access of the poor to goods.
Â Â  .
We must do the best we can.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This vote can therefore take place today.
A very warm welcome to you!
We wish you all the best at home.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I will be very brief.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
A new recycling facility opened in Cork in January.
Â Â  .
Human rights should not be infringed.
We are voting against the resolution in its entirety.
Parliament took no stand on that.
Â Â  .
My party, the Socialist Party, detests dictatorship.
I stand by my support for the resolution.
We are therefore voting in favour of the resolution.
Â Â  .
Parliamentary democracy must not be taken for granted.
IÂ have therefore voted in favour of the resolution.
Â Â  .
I will vote for this resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Indeed, we are witnessing an absolutely appalling situation.
We are therefore voting against this resolution.
Â Â  .
Corruption is a by-product of weak governance.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the statements of vote.
Â Â  .
We are closely following the situation.
Three civilians were killed.
The PKK is a terrorist organisation.
I am looking forward to a very interesting debate.
Â Â  .
There can never be an excuse.
Many analysts have drawn a completely different conclusion.
We have to invest in more cultural freedom.
That is the only solution.
Â Â  .
There must be no more of them.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Turkish state is becoming more democratic.
The PKK needs to do the same.
It also needs to renovate its leadership.
This organisation was formed with a Cold War mentality.
It needs to evolveâ.
Turkey has chosen its prospects.
However, Turkey must continue on this course.
The Copenhagen criteria constitute the roadmap.
I would like to hear your opinion on this.
That is itself a factor in the PKK campaign.
The Kurdish extremists must end their terrorism.
Â Â  .
We expect more to be done in this respect.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We find ourselves in a similar situation today.
Â Â  .
The Government of Sudan says that this is colonialism.
It is not.
The violence has to stop.
What is it that is happening there?
How does that feel?
So what is the government doing?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
You cannot imagine how hard their lives are.
That is what it amounts to.
How many more conflicts do we need?
And now Darfur is far too far away.
Â Â  .
It is planting season now in southern Sudan.
If nothing is planted, famine will result.
Let us call a spade a spade.
Some countries are treating the Sudan with kid gloves.
The United Nations cannot do anything.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Let me say immediately that religious persecution is non-Islamic.
What can we do?
I urge you to support this resolution.
Â Â  .
It is a politicised Islam that persecutes these minorities.
Â Â  .
It also represents the current state of European civilisation.
They are the autochthonous inhabitants of those lands.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Violence breeds violence, just as aggression breeds aggression.
I support the resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Egypt is instrumental in helping us in that task.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thanks to pressure from us, he was released.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
He tries to give Egyptian people hope.
Egyptian people deserve democracy.
Why is AymanÂ Nour in prison?
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is Voting Time.
The text is as follows: '5a.
Calls for the liberation of DrÂ Ayman Nour'.
That concludes Voting Time.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  Does anybody else wish to speak?
Although really, one speaker is enoughÂ â¦
We cannot but respect the name of this country.
Are there any comments?
That is the simple way I see things.
We shall seeÂ ...
That argument seems unanswerable to me.
The majority will decide.
That is democracy, thank you.
Â Â  .
My personal contact with Chernobyl was very close.
The suffering of these people cannot be measured.
There is another reason.
The risk of that is too great.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mr President, today is a day of remembrance.
First of all, we need more dignity.
The victims deserve dignity.
That means fast breeders, enrichment, retreatment.
Societies must learn.
Now is the time for decision.
Â Â  .
Nuclear power is not safe.
Aged reactors are dangerous reactors.
We are leaving it up to future generations.
The fuel will run out one day.
We still do not know how many people died.
People are still dying.
Caesium has an active cycle of 35 years.
Deaths from thyroid cancer have multiplied a hundredfold.
What conclusion do we need to draw?
We must call for nuclear disarmament.
Do you know why?
Democracy needs courage.
Â Â  .
Those people are forgotten today in our discussions.
I shall end with this short quote.
I was two months pregnant 20 years ago.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Those are the questions that arise.
Has sufficient legislation been enacted in these areas?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is of course a political judgement.
Secondly, there are separate thematic safeguard clauses.
Â Â  .
Therefore, urgent attention is needed in this area.
The same is true concerning money laundering in Bulgaria.
Â Â  .
They can be summed up in a single sentence.
Â Â  .
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  .
What do we think?
Â Â  .
You said the values defined the borders.
Currently both countries are strongly pro-European Union.
That is not what this is about at all.
Let us look at the parallel consequences:
This is not a European Union any more.
It is bad for us.
It is bad for them.
In fact the whole project looks like madness.
They are not perfect in all aspects.
That is very important.
I know that great progress has been made there.
I have seen some progress.
There are new laws in place.
What is happening to them?
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Let me go through them again.
Â Â  .
I want to make very clear what this means.
This is just not true.
These are Palestinian taxes which people have already paid.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I will conclude by making three suggestions:
Â Â  .
Mr President, we are in a catch-22 situation.
Mine is no exception.
If we do not, others will.
What should we be asking?
Have any of you spoken to Hamas?
No one has tried to talk to Hamas!
Â Â  .
That is very serious.
The enormity of this decision warrants more plausible explanations.
In Palestine, the occupation is omnipresent.
What kind of game are we playing, then?
Why are the Palestinians being punished?
I welcome this stance.
How does the state of Israel see this?
We have to try to find another tool.
Where are we now?
However, the difficult task now begins.
We are at a crossroads.
Â Â  .
That is what we are doing.
Many speakers have referred to the need for even-handedness.
We will certainly continue to do so.
Â Â  .
We have been very clear on that.
Are we applying double standards?
Here, President Mahmoud Abbas has shown his readiness.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
I hope Hamas will commit to peaceful means.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
And I hope that this represents great progress.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Chile has its first woman president.
Parliament has debated Cuba on many occasions.
Such a partnership must be a broad one.
Â Â  .
I wish you success at the summit in Vienna.
That is the direction we must take.
The rest is just pretty words.
Some of us are more honest.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you, Madam President.
His presence in Bregenz demonstrated this.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is important for our future work.
Â Â  .
Each country has different rules.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
This is hypocrisy in its saddest form.
Except that this is no longer true.
Thank you for your words of solidarity.
This is happening as we speak.
Is this really helping democracy?
In April âEkranasâ stopped.
We will have to watch developments very carefully.
This is a very serious matter.
Thank you.
Let us put our own house in order.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It is now 7.45Â p.m.
So what is the use of granting discharge?
I will return to this in a moment.
There have been a number of developments since then.
Secondly, what is financial control like over there?
Â Â  .
There is something else that is equally unacceptable.
The instinct is to cover things up.
Whistle-blowers lose their jobs instead of receiving praise.
That is a deeply undemocratic attitude.
The Montoyer project, too, should be examined.
I did not find out why.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  âMr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for your attention.
I support the PSE Group line in this regard.
This is overdue.
That, too, must change in future.
Â Â  .
This might have been going on for 25Â years.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I have three points.
It is going to go on all evening.
Are we trying to hide something from the public?
The Commission is doing an excellent job.
I have four points on that.
We should start researching to see what actually happened.
Let us look at what really happened.
Thirdly, we need more information.
It gives us no information about what actually happened.
The discharge procedure is an extremely important one.
Unfortunately, not enough has been done.
Praise is obviously in order.
This is elementary economic logic.
Â Â  .
He has produced a sterling report.
My third point concerns the Committee of the Regions.
Â Â  .
This situation is intolerable.
Their efforts have been admirable and quite extraordinarily extensive.
The system should be abolished.
We must ensure that this is done.
No, of course it is not.
Do not, then, read through the contracts.
And here?
What is happening here is dangerous, very dangerous.
This is totally unacceptable.
It is only right.
It is very clear what they are saying.
We are the Budgetary Control Committee!
It is not enough merely to postpone discharge.
Â Â  â Mr President, transparency engenders trust.
Why is this debate being held at night?
Does somebody want to protect the City of Strasbourg?
Paris protects it.
Why?
This debate is very important.
This is what taxpayers expect from us today.
Alas, we have been proven to be correct.
So what now?
I would ask you to support these amendments.
That brings in several million euros.
We shall certainly find the truth in this dossier.
This is something that receives our unqualified support.
We are shocked by what has happened in Strasbourg.
Yes or no?
Yes or no?
Â Â  .
The interinstitutional agreement is preliminarily agreed.
I must say that the positive attitude is increasing.
So there is definitely an increase in positive attitude.
We can be modestly optimistic about it.
Thank you very much for your comments.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The Commission appears to concur with this view.
Â Â  .
This has served us well to date.
This is serious and promising work.
We do not have the full picture yet.
This leads us to the disclosure area.
These are increasingly powerful players in European financial markets.
How do we move on from here?
Which brings me to a crucial point.
I believe that this area also needs our attention.
Â Â  .
This work will have a dual focus.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The report certainly makes for very interesting reading.
Â Â  .
The rapporteur has expressed clear views.
However, there is a background to this.
That is of paramount importance.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We must be able to respond to that challenge.
Â Â  .
Is there not something wrong here?
Access to risk capital is important for supporting innovation.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I have enjoyed the debate.
To put it in Dutch: .
I have taken careful note of that.
This argument is based on wrong perceptions.
State aid is far down the list.
We want real arguments and not bluff.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs Frassoni.
Â Â  .
Do you know anything about the emergency 112 number?
However, there is no common platform.
Therefore, it is a great idea.
What is needed?
We need the PSAPs to be upgraded.
This will cost about EUR 4.5 billion a year.
Â Â  .
We have not got that far yet.
I ask the House to adopt the report.
I do not regard these studies as credible.
We have witnessed that today.
Â Â  .
However, I am against it.
How many false alarms will this eCall system trigger?
Which expensive new service will it call?
All this rings alarm bells for me.
Â Â  .
We are elected legislators.
Help and the emergency services must arrive quickly.
The eCall scheme is a particularly valuable initiative.
I am referring to the medical emergency services.
This is our primary objective.
All of the stakeholders have broadly welcomed the initiative.
This is investment, rather than a cost.
I address the same request to Parliament.
The Transport Committee supported this proposal, too.
Â Â  .
Therefore, things are moving.
Today we have achieved an important milestone.
- The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
We strongly support this type of grassroots activity.
This high-level group will start work before this summer.
Â Â  .
A sympathetic attitude to diversity also produces economic benefits.
There are no short cuts.
Europe is multicultural and multilingual.
Many of them are now very hard pressed.
I should briefly like to make a second comment.
Â Â  .
Communication is a necessary and powerful tool.
Â Â  .
Thank you.
How well do young Europeans know foreign languages?
Which languages are most spoken?
Is multilingualism on the increase?
Is that really what we want?
We live in a very fast-moving world.
The principle of learning two foreign languages is excellent.
We must not handicap ourselves from the outset.
My answer to both of these questions is no.
It is inevitable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  â The next item is Voting Time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is the whole idea behind the delay.
We now face a similar issue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
â That concludes Voting Time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
More than anything, the timing is poor.
Now is the time to stand firm.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote in favour.
Â Â  .
I welcome this report on the UNESCO Convention.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
The June List objects to this proposal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore support this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is a for granting discharge.
Â Â  .
Why not have a European centre of gerontology?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That, to my mind, is only fair.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I welcome the adoption of Amendments 36 and 38.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We therefore voted against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
All of which in the name of innovation!
We therefore voted against.
Â Â  .
I therefore could not support it.
Â Â  .
It proposes a pan-European automatic emergency call system.
The introduction of eCall entails costs and technical harmonisation.
I have thus chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am therefore voting against both resolutions.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The following amendments have been proposed.
That is wrong.
A decision must be made.
I find that, ifÂ â¦
Please sit down and wait.
MrÂ Lehne, you have already spoken.
(1)
Thank you once again, Mr President.
You have the floor.
The issue of education has been abandoned.
My parents had no documentation.
We want to eradicate illiteracy in my country.
The industrialisation of natural resources is important.
There will be no exclusion or marginalisation.
We do not have a culture of drug-trafficking.
We are talking about the 19th century.
They use private banks.
That will be our responsibility.
Why am I talking about the original indigenous people?
You are perfectly aware of Boliviaâs history.
We no longer want to be a beggar State.
We want to put an end to that.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Do we agree with that?
Do we agree with this?
No precise evidence is available as to what happened.
This occurrence confirms the dire conditions in Russian prisons.
The Black Sea turned red.
The only difference is that post-Hitler Germany said sorry.
People do not forget history, they relive it.
His passing away is a great loss.
That leads to a legal process lasting 18Â years.
There were political orders, however.
Thank you, MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen.
You might ask who is responsible for this.
Is this surprising?
I shall just relate one little anecdote.
Let us not be influenced by the minorities.
The present situation in this area is utterly unacceptable.
The EU does make a difference in Addis Ababa.
We must not let the people of Ethiopia down.
Poverty reduction and schooling are seriously at risk.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
What happened before they did so?
I regard that as a very sensible proposal.
Â Â  .
I would like to make three points.
Â Â  .
There was a certain balance.
That is lacking in the European Parliament.
Nonetheless it is something our citizens expect.
In practice that has usually worked quite well.
There I believe the Commission should review its position.
Â Â  .
My second comment concerns the role of national parliaments.
It does not seem enough.
Only then will the legislation improve.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is a fact.
We therefore need proper criteria in this respect.
I am looking forward to an interesting debate.
Â Â  .
Those are the facts of the matter.
So do you eat dry cornflakes all day?
I do not.
Commissioner Verheugen has just delivered yet another one.
Â Â  .
The food industry is cashing in on this.
There is a proliferation of all kinds of claims.
We must avoid consumers being taken for a ride.
Of course, this does not work in practice.
Deception comes in many guises.
They are used in the United States.
Nor will the sugary lollypop by adding vitamin A.
These are now in place.
Our group is behind the consumer and well-meaning enterprises.
This legislation ensures that consumers are given honest information.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  .
Does it meet the original aims?
We believe it does.
This is a good result.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It was an extremely arduous task.
Immediate action must be taken.
I also welcome the increased support to SMEs.
This regulation will stimulate innovation.
The solution is much more complex.
It is neither a vitamin nor a mineral.
In food and water it is a curse.
It only affects fluoride in food and water.
I welcome this legislation because we need it.
Responsible retailers and manufacturers I have met welcome it.
However, those limits have not yet been published.
The UK has had enough of this misinformed interference.
People are fat and people are inactive.
MrÂ Schnellhardt illustrated this point well.
Otherwise we would have to reject the proposal outright.
It is a proposal based on logic.
It is simple.
We talk about consumer choice.
It is impossible!
What happens if we do not have this legislation?
What will be the result?
Anybody can say anything and hope for the best.
They prefer to have one piece of legislation.
That is a very important factor.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Consumers are given proper information without being patronised.
The Commission can accept Amendments 50 to 89.
Â Â  .
Amendments 5 and 25 concern exports of glass eels.
This is a trade issue.
Â Â  .
Eel stocks have now declined dramatically.
The Commission must therefore take good note.
Â Â  Make no mistake: eels were the trailblazers.
Todayâs report contains very sensible proposals.
We are heading for an ecological disaster.
This includes the majority of the Baltic States.
The biggest problem is the fishing of elvers.
Â Â  .
Mr Allister raised the question of .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30.
Such problems cannot be solved without effective international cooperation.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Unfortunately there are other problems, however.
Â Â  .
Please take heed of that.
That period should be in the past.
Do read SHERPAâs legal analysis.
Morocco is illegally occupying Western Sahara.
These fisheries agreements are extremely objectionable.
They also cost EU taxpayers huge sums of money.
Let us not pick a quarrel with the Moroccans.
Our information is that everything is moving smoothly.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30.
This is no surprise to most of us.
Enlargement is the second predominant issue.
The Commission intends to respond to these concerns.
We are not suggesting a completely new strategy.
What do we propose?
We need to remove the remaining barriers.
We will present concrete proposals next week.
Let me now turn to the institutional issues.
We welcome the new ratifications.
We stand with Parliament on this.
Many ideas are being discussed.
Yet no consensus exists on the way forward.
Plan D was not a one-off operation.
Â Â  .
We therefore encourage you to keep going.
No one ratifies something that is dead.
Â Â  .
What the citizens of Europe want is more transparency.
They want greater effectiveness in legislation and administration.
They want the subsidiarity principle to be strengthened.
That is a clear message.
It is all in the Constitution, though.
How can it be possible now?
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
We are reaching the limits of the current structures.
That is why we need the Constitution.
Â Â  .
The issue of immigration is also relevant.
This really is a matter of urgency.
We must stop lying to ourselves.
Nothing will happen for years.
Nice?
Parliament has adopted a decision.
Without a Charter of Fundamental Rights?
Without the comprehensive democratisation of the EU?
With no capacity to take action?
Do you really want it without social rights?
You say he is listening to the people.
And what is MrÂ Barroso doing?
Did he not listen?
They did not mention terrorism.
President Barroso is remaining particularly loyal to that topic.
Â Â  .
I think perhaps I have a remedy for you.
Shame on all of you!
There is superficial discussion rather than real debate.
The national veto should remain in those areas.
The social model needs to be reformed drastically.
We need reform.
That really is worthy of criticism.
That, too, has barely been mentioned.
I now come to my main problem.
None of this is in the papers, though.
What is missing is leadership.
A number of your proposals are extremely constructive.
We have high expectations of the Finnish Presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, I have three points.
My final point concerns the blame game.
My final point is directed at the Commissioner.
In communication, less is often more.
I have a few observations to make.
What Europe?
The Europe whose borders we do not know?
None of us.
What Europe?
What Europe?
What Europe?
The Europe with no energy policy?
What Europe?
The Europe without enough democracy?
Talk to me about a single electoral system!
What Europe?
We must counter that.
We must stimulate the widest possible debate.
We need at least another year.
We need wider and deeper reflection.
We will have to address this issue.
That is simply not true.
We have different answers across Europe.
That is going on.
Last year, the EU adopted 3Â 124 regulations.
That he should not be so is unbelievable.
What is its objective?
What is its purpose?
Let us be realistic.
Â Â  .
I think it will help in the ongoing discussion.
I think that is still valid.
It is exactly the Commissionâs line.
We have a plan.
That is what people expect from us.
We have to do both things.
That is really what we ought to discuss.
One idea was mentioned has my strong support.
That is a step towards finding a constitutional settlement.
That is what they expect from us.
This is our response to citizensâ concerns.
Are we really convinced that national vetoes should remain?
We will move forward with these proposals.
The Constitution is not dead.
That was their purpose.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This amounts to a considerable step forward.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We must make the most of them.
This too can give small enterprises a helping hand.
I would like to end on a practical note.
Free and fair competition is leading us into disaster.
We have a very great deal of environmental pollution.
This is a huge figure.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, I will be brief.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
I wonder whether you can help me.
No treaty has replaced the Treaty of Nice.
These amendments should therefore be declared inadmissible.
Â Â  I am sorry, MrÂ Bloom.
I got your name wrong.
I called you MrÂ Berlato.
I apologise.
How could I have failed to recognise you?
Your point is essentially political and very well made.
We all take note of it, thank you.
You have the floor.
Â Â  (1).
We have rejected and condemned attacks against civilians.
We have rejected terrorism in its forms.
Our approach needs the support of the international community.
Thank you for listening to me.
Â Â  Thank you very much Mr President.
Â Â  We now resume the vote.
This is incorrect.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  We have voted against this report.
Â Â  .
We have thus voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted against the Karas report.
For that reason, I voted against this report.
Â Â  .
In 1999, the Munich Court withdrew its allegations.
In 2003, the proceedings were cancelled.
Hence our vote against.
I am delighted about the fact.
Â Â  .
None of these assumptions is valid.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
And who cares if they give children tooth decay?
Politics is partly about accepting compromises.
Â Â  .
The aim is truth in advertising.
Â Â  .
This was 14 years ago now.
Consequently, this result receives my unqualified support.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It also raises the 40% escape rate objective.
Â Â  .
We Social Democrats voted against the agreement.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
In this respect, the Agreement is crucial.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I should first like to speak about Western Sahara.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Morocco is not recognised as the administrative power.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Sometimes less is more.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the McCarthy report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I am abstaining from voting.
Cost-effectiveness is a better objective.
In short, it can do what it wishes.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let us give credit where it is due.
The rules of the club must be respected.
Practical preparations for accession need to continue.
Â Â  .
Yet the Cassandras have been proven wrong.
Today, everything fits together.
Ten countries joined us on 1 May 2004.
Tomorrow, you travel to Romania and Bulgaria.
Tearing down the Berlin Wall was the easy part.
Building a new democratic culture takes much longer.
In many other areas the Commission identifies failings.
These must be put right without delay.
Can that be said of all current Member States?
There would have been outrage.
So, stand to your responsibilities.
You share responsibility for this!
It is too easy.
Nothing.
I am going to tell you something very simple.
I am in favour of enlargement.
I am for enlarging Europe!
Not, however, in just any old way.
Why should they be made to pay?
It is not a question of rejecting Bulgaria.
Last week, I was in a Roma quarter.
What I saw there was unbelievable.
What has happened to the money?
Please do so.
It will be unable to reply to you.
No; the world has to change.
We find ourselves today in a curious situation.
I understand the fanatical opponents of nuclear power.
How will Greece make up for the missing power?
They can always purchase emission permits.
Â Â  .
This also mirrors our message to the Commission.
Â Â  .
We all know what the basics are.
Everything else can be sorted out by simple legislation.
I still think it is wise.
Postponing accession would present practical problems.
The debate on enlargement would become still more tense.
It is a hugely exciting moment.
Inevitably, there are problems.
I thank the Commissioner for all his work.
How can we stave off such a negative outcome?
That constitutes considerable progress.
However, this image is far from complete.
The opposite is the case.
They stated: âBanning is bannedâ.
Robin Hood could not be killed.
They do not deserve that.
The Commission has made no such recommendation.
Let us be clear on this.
There has been progress since October.
That is vitally important.
Much has been achieved in the last six months.
That is also our groupâs ambition.
That is beyond question.
We all know that.
MrÂ Cohn-Bendit is right there.
It is the Commission that is acting responsibly here.
Pierre Moscovici has said so.
No, that will not do.
We will therefore need better instruments in future.
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania is beyond question.
The decision is being deferred more and more.
Corruption â universal.
Corrections must be possible.
This self-deception is cowardly and dangerous.
I will give you one example of this.
The question is who really benefits from this.
Well, I am all for free trade.
I wonder whom the Commission will answer to?
There is plenty of scope for buying judgmentsâ.
The mistake was to promise them accession too early.
The progress is therefore evident.
I am optimistic.
We are all aware of the criteria too.
EU integration is like a tango.
It takes two for it to work.
As a result, everything gets through.
Yet there is no scanner.
So what has changed compared to 1Â May 2004?
Pressure from the European Union has brought that about.
It has not been completed yet.
The conditions are not yet fully satisfied.
That is important.
Romania is a European-minded country through and through.
The law on minorities is an example to others.
My only problem today is the lack of clarity.
That is what we are all looking for.
What do we expect?
A new State prosecutor in Bulgaria?
No.
To what extent does immunity need to be lifted?
How many cases do we need to raise?
How many decisions in court do we need?
I have a suggestion to make to you.
This report hardly mentions it.
These are unresolved matters.
Or to ensure higher education in the Hungarian language.
Or to enforce the principle of self-governance.
Or to amend the discriminatory Elections Act.
This needs support both from Bucharest and Brussels.
So an unqualified thank you.
We must continue to monitor the problem areas mentioned.
That is worth a huge compliment.
This is the Commissionâs role.
Let me raise two specific issues.
Â Â  â Mr President and Commissioner Rehn.
Thank you very much.
I do not see any other solution.
Such concern is altogether commendable.
Romania and Bulgaria have done a good job.
Why?
Â Â  .
I fully agree with that.
I agree.
Why is the adoption of the Minority Act delayed?
Another unresolved issue is the restitution of church property.
It should come to us with a clear opinion.
The way forward is politically preordained.
That is what we need to focus on.
They have come a long way.
Of course there are shortcomings.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
All international adoption applications are systematically rejected.
The following questions have been submitted to the Commission.
What form will the Commission action take?
Is there a timescale for any intended Commission action?
Â Â  .
It includes provisions on prior information.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I might perhaps send you those reports, Commissioner.
I believe another one is about to start.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I should like to explain why.
This situation has obviously now changed.
This is very important.
It is really a tightening-up of the situation.
Â Â  .
That was crucial.
That was a major achievement.
What would it cost the organic producers?
Can she give me those figures?
Â Â  .
Excessive roaming charges need to be eliminated.
Â Â  .
We had 150 contributions.
We should have the same charges throughout Europe.
Â Â  .
She asked about the legal basis of this regulation.
Here we are talking about Article 95.
Â Â  .
We are very proud of that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I should like to thank the Commissioner.
Â Â  .
I really believe in self-regulation in that field.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This applies particularly to many countries in Asia.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There will be no balance as regards its results.
Â Â  .
I can confirm what I already said.
It is part of our negotiation strategy.
We firmly believe that trade concessions should be reciprocal.
Â Â  .
Biofuels are needed for two main reasons.
Biofuels can significantly contribute to this aim.
The public consultation poses a number of questions.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your response.
That is absolutely vital.
What does the Commission intend to do about this?
A reduction in fuels ...
Â Â  .
It must also be done in a sustainable way.
Only both combined can give the necessary result.
Â Â  Firstly, I welcome your reply, Commissioner.
I would urge you along the route of certification.
So I would push you in that direction.
Â Â  .
Is any thought being given to this?
Â Â  .
The car industry will follow our political trend.
In some States it is already.
Â Â  .
It has been highlighted in the Green Paper.
That is one of the actions that we indicate.
Energy independence is therefore very important.
Europe could provide for itself with these.
Â Â  . Of course.
That is one thing we are concentrating on.
Â Â  .
It is very important that Russia recognised that.
That is no big surprise.
Â Â  .
There are two paths that we are following.
That concludes questions to the Commission.
The compromise proposal is therefore acceptable to the Commission.
Â Â  .
We hope she will be back with us soon.
It is a very welcome initiative.
Let me say something about the contents.
I have to respect that.
Parliament said a clear No back in 2004.
I think we can agree to this compromise.
That is right and it is a good contribution.
These are siblings of animals that are sick.
Earlier, all these animals were most brutally slaughtered.
They cannot of course be eaten themselves.
They have done some very important work.
We believe the European Parliament should be involved.
Â Â  .
What are the advantages I see?
That makes for clarity and reliability in the implementation.
All right, it is a compromise.
I would have preferred it to be clearly separated.
Â Â  .
That really goes without saying.
The strict conditions and controls are to be welcomed.
Â Â  .
The problems with fishmeal lie elsewhere.
Let me give you just two examples.
Â Â  .
Scientific rigour is at the core of this regulation.
Thank you for your patience.
Therefore I believe that is a step backwards.
Is that what the public wants?
I send my good wishes to Mrs Roth-Behrendt.
I hope she will be back soon.
That is indeed controversial.
Of course we have the precautionary principle to consider.
It affords an excellent guarantee of consumer protection.
Three aspects are important in this regard.
The deadlines are about to expire.
It has caused huge problems and is unworkable.
We are ten years down the road.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
These currently amount to EURÂ 19Â million.
We can support all of Parliamentâs amendments.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen.
Why do SIM cards work in all mobile phones?
Technical requirements are set out in detailed technical standards.
This represents a challenge.
Â Â  .
Let me turn to some of the issues.
That is where it should be.
That is what this proposal is all about.
I need to make another brief comment.
I value the Commissionâs proposal highly.
I would therefore like to thank MrsÂ PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Those are the terms of the Treaty.
The candidate proposed to us clearly meets those criteria.
That should also be mentioned at this point.
That was just an aside.
Â Â  .
That was why we abstained in the vote.
The ALDE Group expressly supports this proposal.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
This calls for continued efforts to improve tax policy.
I should like to discuss that briefly.
I should like to point out three factual elements.
Unemployment has remained high at around 9%.
The Commissioner has provided us with more up-to-date information.
All the indicators point to that.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
My view may be summarised in three points.
I really do feel under threat.
Of that I am all in favour.
He was on foot outside the hotel.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
Some deficits, though, still remain.
There is no legal obstacle to its adoption.
This interinstitutional agreement was negotiated under extremely difficult circumstances.
Â Â  .
I have just three brief observations to make.
Secondly, there is the overall ceiling to consider.
Â Â  .
Their support and tight cooperation has brought great results.
That was also very helpful.
There are also new elements.
Â Â  .
This must surely be counted as a deficit.
Let us imagine Europe being struck by a tsunami.
Â Â  .
That is very dangerous and something we must avoid.
Â Â  .
We obtained that sub-heading: it is sub-heading 3a.
We obtained that increase in appropriations.
Â Â  .
Parliament should be fully involved in this.
There is a need for sweeping reform.
Rather, it is the art of the possible.
I therefore recommend voting in favour of the agreement.
Let me give an example.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am fundamentally opposed to this.
It is seeking something entirely different.
We should keep that in mind.
So far everybody has gained from it.
The purpose was to improve employment prospects in particular.
You cannot leave the text and the context unchanged.
Why not?
It does not provide for financial perspectives.
That, of course, is true.
That is to be welcomed.
I do not think so.
Our judgement is that it does not.
We are not without ideas.
Nonetheless, we disagree with it in essence.
Words mean nothing.
The first of these is the Flexibility Instrument.
That is madness.
The diagnosis is virtually unanimous.
As regards the scope, opinion remains very divided.
Therefore, this unified approach is unjustified.
What have you done with the rural development fund?
This is the budget of hypocrisy.
Would you believe it?
I challenge anyone to understand that.
Have we learnt nothing?
Have they achieved this?
Â Â  .
What would have been the result of that?
Â Â  .
Mr President, we all listened and debated today.
Today, this decision is in your hands.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Is it a good compromise?
Today it seems that this compromise is a success.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
It is an honour to have you here.
There is no question that Europe needs good pole-vaulters.
Â Â  .
How can humanity be given meaning?
Development without social justice is meaningless.
Prosperity without wellbeing is simply a contradiction.
What sort of world are we fighting for?
What is the vision we are trying to implement?
Is that vision utopian or a realistic ambition?
We have good reason to be optimistic.
Enlargement had an historic and a moral dimension.
We welcome this strategic enlargement towards southeast Europe.
... a major European problem which still awaits resolution.
The challenges are before us.
The words are used to hide the meaning.
Life is hard in much of Europe today.
Workers worry about their jobs being moved outside Europe.
There is acute social insecurity.
This is not political romanticism.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Â Â  .
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That was worthwhile.
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
Hence our rejection.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
1.
2.
3.
4.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This needs to be matched by increased funding.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I have voted against the Interinstitutional Agreement.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There is no such thing as a perfect budget.
Those are the reasons justifying my abstention.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our decision to abstain.
We have every reason to fight to overturn it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have therefore voted against this report.
I am thus voting against the proposal.
Â Â  .
How long is this irresponsibility going to last?
This policy is inhumane and must be overturned.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
European growth remains worryingly slow.
I therefore voted in favour of the Rosati report.
Â Â  .
This year we are doing so.
It is the right choice.
Human rights are not a part-time occupation.
We can do better.
Europe must practice what it preaches.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I thank Mr Howitt for his excellent report.
I also welcome the comprehensive analysis of action.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is recognition of the importance of this report.
We are essentially undertaking an experiment.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We achieved this result despite the difficulties involved.
We can congratulate the rapporteur and the political groups.
These programmes do not seem appropriate to me.
Â Â  .
So who is talking about human rights?
The Red Indians.
Who is talking about human rights?
Who is talking about human rights?
Who is talking about human rights?
Who is talking?
Who is talking?
Â Â  .
The policy should be effective.
I hope we continue in this way.
Again, that is included in this report.
And this must be included in our resolution.
For this, I personally thank him.
This is not an abstraction.
Europe cannot be an end in itself.
I am aware that this is difficult.
Thank you, Mr President.
This situation has deteriorated in the last few months.
Europe is the strongest bastion of humanism.
My thanks to the rapporteur.
Â Â  .
We have continually seen this demonstrated.
My response to that too is yes.
Thirdly, are we contributing and doing enough?
Are we having an impact?
Let us work towards this!
Parliament can certainly count on me.
Neither I nor my services will spare any efforts.
Â Â  .
I fully agree with that.
That is what the three institutions must do.
Mrs Lynne talked about trafficking in human beings.
I fully agree that this issue is very important.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
For example, Saudi Arabia barely gets a mention.
Â Â  .
Three of the four instruments are codecided.
These points were accepted.
We have no difficulty in accepting that.
I recognise that Parliament is not convinced on this.
This position is shared by the Council.
That compromise is very finely balanced.
We have said so on several occasions.
The Commission understands the underlying concern behind these amendments.
I know legal advice differs on this.
This is the establishment of sectoral spending targets.
This is a key element in the architecture.
Â Â  .
The Commission has already made reference to this.
We do not want a financial black hole here.
Â Â  .
Codecision is not negotiable.
These require a full and proper debate in Parliament.
They need our continued support.
For that, we need a legal base.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Its extent has, however, not been defined.
Thank you, Mr President.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
In that respect, consultation is not sufficient.
Â Â  .
Nevertheless, I am concerned about the neighbourhood instrument.
Why should we go back on an established right?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The second point was more serious.
The existing procedure is complex, incomprehensible and opaque.
The negotiation process has succeeded in overcoming the differences.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It must also apply for the multiannual financial framework.
Thank you very much.
That is something that remains unacceptable to this House.
We are prepared to restrict the number of regulations.
If Europe disappoints, euroscepticism will increase.
That is why this is so very problematic.
What price external relations then?
Now there is political, uncivil insecurity for you!
Implementing provisions will also be important.
We do not have a lot of time.
This Parliament will not allow that to happen.
Poverty matters to them; it matters to us.
That is why codecision is so important.
That is why transparency is so important.
That is why accountability is so important.
Whoever in the Commission thought this up?
We have to set policy.
I congratulate Mr Mitchell on a very good report.
There are lots of hints.
Thank you.
At any rate, there is no coordination.
My request to the Commission therefore comprises three points.
I warmly welcome the establishment of the IPA.
Â Â  .
We want to do that in all good faith.
Â Â  .
The DCECI instrument is fully subject to codecision.
This is a complete misunderstanding and an incorrect interpretation.
It is unnecessarily complicated.
I could not agree more with MrÂ Brok.
All the elements are already on the table.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The Commission can accept the following amendments:
The Commission can accept the following amendments in principle:
The Commission can accept the following amendments in part:
The Commission cannot accept the following amendments:
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This does not, however, constitute a connection.
Â Â  .
I see a different, more fundamental, problem.
Â Â  .
I disagree, MrÂ Rack.
Nothing has been shelved.
Â Â  .
I should like to understand how this is possible.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is difficult.
Â Â  .
I beg your indulgence and a little more patience.
What is your view of the situation?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Synergy effects must be obtained in this sphere.
Â Â  .
The Treaty has now been signed by four states.
Â Â  .
What is the Councilâs position on this?
There are two ways of handling budgets.
The same goes for the fight against customs fraud.
Common rules on taxation are very limited.
Â Â  â There are not yet any cost estimates available.
Â Â  â This relates to the same subject.
The tax competition should ensue from different tax rates.
We do not want to eliminate competition.
Â Â  I thank the Council for that very comprehensive response.
These states are extremely dependent on our benevolence.
Â Â  â I shall return to this question later.
One question relates to money laundering.
The Commission is also holding talks on this subject.
Â Â  I thank the Presidency for that reply.
This potential risk must be clearly recognised.
The issue of Iran has already been mentioned.
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
What could the Council have to hide?
Â Â  .
This dynamic reference also strikes me as very important.
The Commission will also be required to do so.
Â Â  .
Such a situation could not go on.
Let me now turn to the question.
This is quite an important clause.
The reference to specific circumstances allows for this flexibility.
Â Â  .
An exchange of information is obviously vital.
We need a pan-European approach to this issue.
Thus the Treaty is a good solution.
Â Â  .
There are also causes for concern.
This kind of binding commitment is important.
Â Â  .
I should like to make one final remark.
There would be stability.
This is a very common technique.
What are these circumstances?
How short are your memories?
We heard this excuse before.
This is all about enlargement by the back door.
That being the case, why not say so?
Why keep it secret?
My questions are as follows.
Which countries are continuing negotiations?
What priorities are we setting?
What will be the impact on energy generation?
Â Â  .
This Treaty does not address that issue at all.
This provides an opportunity.
So I think there has been some misunderstanding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Are you prepared to begin, MrÂ Elles?
Â Â  .
We take a different view.
Running through the report are three interlinked strands.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It has to be genuinely new money.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These would be constructive arrangements.
To conclude, I wish MrÂ Elles good luck.
Â Â  .
The EUâs greatest challenge is reducing unemployment.
They should be quickly brought to completion.
It is important that these funds are used.
Our group supports this.
Â Â  .
I rest my case.
The second priority concerns the rendezvous clause.
Please, let us leave them as they are.
Â Â  .
Is anyone against any of this?
No.
Let me put forward some suggestions.
The trading of emissions rights must now be restructured.
These two institutions have outlived their purpose.
Â Â  .
It is rather a conventional budget.
I would like to highlight three areas.
Congratulations!
Internal security is one of these areas.
It is now time to honour this.
This is as far as we will go.
I hope so, but I also doubt it.
I should like to congratulate MrÂ Elles on this.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
The Commissionâs proposal is comprehensive.
Â Â  .
This may actually make investments efficient.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Cities face a range of problems.
Thank you, MrsÂ Krehl.
There can never be too much of that.
Is that really what we want?
Obviously not.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes this item.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Â Â  .
I am not sure.
The climate is changing.
Commissioner, you referred to the water shortage.
To this end, solidarity is also crucial.
Â Â  .
We have a huge amount of work facing us.
Yesterday, we all took note of that failure.
Â Â  .
Foreign policy is therefore an equally important dimension.
Our solidarity should not be confined to our borders.
Who, therefore, decides what qualifies for it?
MrÂ Wojciechowski broadly addressed this precise point.
At least they have been heard.
Rather, the right way forward is to diversify.
For this I thank all of the rapporteurs.
Â Â  Mr President, I am from Ireland.
I have no problem with that.
The Solidarity Fund is crucial.
These reports are well drafted.
Natural disasters belong to the latter group.
Â Â  .
We are tied to the funds available.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
I therefore voted in favour of the Krehl report.
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I support this report.
Â Â  .
Obviously, we condemn all human rights violations.
Â Â  .
Its real aim, however, is something different.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This presents us with a twofold difficulty.
That is something about which we have our doubts.
We therefore voted against the report.
We have therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I completely agree with this.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The following points were adopted in plenary:
2.
The establishment of a Community forest fire protection programme;
3.
4.
5.
6.
Â Â  .
I welcome the Estrela report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
For this reason, prevention measures must be taken.
I therefore voted in favour of the Estrela report.
Â Â  .
After all, prevention is always better than cure.
We have therefore voted against both reports.
Â Â  .
That will be the task of the European Union.
Â Â  .
Finally this has taken place.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is a major victory for the Nepalese people.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It certainly does not speak for them.
Â Â  .
Both sides have violated the ceasefire.
I want it to reinstate the Human Rights Commission.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Human Rights Commission is now up and running.
What we have to do is continue talking.
Who should do the talking?
We have to bring peace to the island.
Â Â  .
All parties must abandon violence once and for all.
We should instead carry on talking.
Perhaps the next one will.
Â Â  .
We are clearly witnessing a very serious escalation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Only States can have that status.
They take part in the warning system.
Why is this so?
Â Â  .
Taiwan deserves better.
I have three points to make.
Â Â  .
That is the position the EU supports.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
This is something I refuse to accept.
The subject is closed.
The Union is said to be expanding too fast.
History and the direction of history are unequivocal.
The Union must continue to grow.
Both are necessary.
âEurope still consists solely of small countries.
That is the fundamental question.
For we must face the facts.
Habits set in.
Wear and tear take their toll.
What went wrong in France and the Netherlands?
Unemployment remains high.
A powerful European response is not forthcoming.
There is a simple reason for that.
We would regard that situation as âunmanageableâ.
The same goes for a common foreign policy.
Well, that is not the case.
Theoretically, of course, there are various possibilities.
I will let you guess.
This declaration to the Constitution would be rendered meaningless.
They did not need time to reflect.
That was 52 years ago.
What is the big difference?
What is needed?
The answer is simple: courage, political courage.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Prime Minister.
Thank you for your extensive and penetrating speech.
So let us be positive about Europe!
Â Â  .
We now have 15 states.
MrÂ Vanhanen is doing what you are doing.
That is the logical and normal way to go.
The Estonians ratified the constitution a few weeks ago.
You also referred to another particularly important point.
They must have their reasons.
I am quite convinced of that.
I am absolutely convinced of that.
I think you are right, MrÂ Verhofstadt.
Europe is lacking in courage.
Â Â  .
We are trapped in a perfectly obvious contradiction.
Â Â  .
I believe that that is the main problem.
We cannot cleverly sidestep it.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrÂ Wurtz.
Â Â  .
I am not sure.
It was clear last year!
What is it about you, Mr Verhofstadt?
Â Â  Calm down, MrÂ Schulz, calm down.
Â Â  .
Personally, I am against a federal Europe.
The discussion is now taking place.
As it happens, the opposite is true.
Â Â  .
That is something that we cannot accept.
Turkey is of no consequence to them.
I can tell you, MrÂ Farage
That is not how things work.
Perhaps I should plead guilty, MrÂ Poettering.
Therein lies the response to globalisation.
Once again, we are discussing energy policy.
These days that deserves acknowledgement.
Prime Minister, we agree with your observations.
Who would have thought it?
Allow me to add just one proposal.
He does not hide his goal.
He does not deny the facts.
Take heart, MrÂ Verhofstadt.
Organise direct elections to a new convention.
Put every document on the Internet.
Â Â  An outstanding performance, MrÂ Verhovstadt.
The first aspect is the time factor.
MrÂ Verhofstadt emphasised the problem of the Lisbon process.
We have no time to lose.
Five years for the Community patent is stupid.
We have spoken of the rejection of the Constitution.
Nowadays, people do not have that feeling.
The Constitution is not dead!â.
Why do you not listen?
Stop digging!
Who is right?
We need to know.
I think that is a mistake.
The Constitution sadly failed those basic tests.
I think that they can.
It is a praiseworthy initiative, in my view.
Reality is hard.
I am indebted to him for this.
This is what I would call schizophrenia.
Many Members also mentioned masochism.
Thank you for your attention.
We need more.
Take Europe further by means of specific projects?
Let us start from there.
The second question is whether we want a constitution.
Yes we do, but not at all costs.
Neither fear is an accurate representation of reality.
For what purpose?
It will be after the French and Dutch elections.
I really commend him and congratulate him on that.
It would lose its identity.
So let us not try to hide things.
Could he be more specific?
Finally, we must not isolate ourselves.
Â Â  .
How was the matter to be presented?
That is what they had in mind.
That was the motive behind the four fifths.
Why not move forward with it in real terms?
Â Â  Thank you very much, Prime Minister.
This has certainly been an interesting debate.
In a word, unacceptable.
Where to now, Europe?
On that we are agreed.
This dialogue with the United States is being continued.
Â Â  .
Hopefully the US Administration will go this way.
Â Â  .
GuantÃ¡namo is in this category.
Â Â  .
We will play no part in it.
This Parliament will play no part in it.
Â Â  .
Anything else will be a travesty of justice.
Â Â  .
What do you intend to do about it?
Will you make real demands?
What will we do about this now?
What should happen to those people?
Â Â  .
Those terrorists were substantially funded by US citizens.
Some of those suspects are British citizens.
Who knows?
No evidence is produced, no trials take place.
This is the biggest victory of democracy over terrorism.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
That being said, matters are coming slightly unstuck.
This will have consequences at some point.
We already have a transatlantic market.
It exists.
What investments take place?
As can be seen, the figure is huge.
Yet that is not the case.
This provides you with a good example.
Go to MTU.
That is only one example, however.
That is only natural and to be expected.
Obviously, there is a clash of interests.
That is also the way it should be.
Disputes are normal.
Many of them we cannot solve.
There are also problems on the American side.
So what about their precautionary principle?
Let us live with the situation.
Hence, my proposal for tomorrow concerning split voting.
Madam President, I know that you are nervous.
I forgot to include bioethanol and biodiesel.
Therefore, I shall say tomorrow: and diesel.
And that, in theory, is everything.
Thank you.
We are each othersâ most important trading partners.
Â Â  .
The first is energy.
The US is facing a similar problem.
The second issue is visas.
The third issue I wanted to tackle is China.
Let me address the Transatlantic Partnership Agreement.
However, this might change in the future.
Â Â  .
That relationship effectively operates at two levels.
The warning bell is ringing on the DDA.
The window on the Doha round is closing rapidly.
Â Â  .
We would like something similar in the future.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These are more than mere figures.
We must not take it for granted.
Â Â  .
We are both independent partners in the partnership.
Â Â  .
I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs.
We should reject both extremes.
This needs commitment from the Commission.
The second topic is Iran.
We must remain firm in this matter.
Allow me to prove it to you.
That is our big mistake.
We want a relationship on equal terms.
We have ÎÎÎ¤Î with an American commander-in-chief.
Even our stock exchanges follow the Dow Jones index.
We do not have our own policy.
We have American hegemony.
However, such niceties are being ignored.
Are all the barriers to the transatlantic market undesirable?
No.
No.
Â Â  .
Let me respond to a few question rather briefly.
It will certainly give us more strength.
Â Â  .
That is something that we can applaud and encourage.
Â Â  That concludes the joint debate.
Global problems require global and prompt action.
Let us fly the flag!
I wish that the opposite were true.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your suggestion.
I think we shall do that.
Â Â  That concludes the item.
Â Â  .
Trade liberalisation needs to be implemented gradually.
I shall give a number of concrete examples.
We have not made any service requests to LDCs.
Â Â  .
There is no doubt on this score.
Our group rejected this position.
Â Â  .
But the challenge is far from over.
But trade is not a magic bullet.
Free trade is not the same as .
These will form the engine of growth.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Rapporteur: Erika Mann (A6-0171/2006).
I was extremely pleased to work with them.
However, this is the situation we have.
Earlier legislation already included robust measures on these points.
The timing differences between Member States are too great.
Â Â  .
I am grateful for your support of this proposal.
I wish her a speedy recovery.
Â Â  .
Blockbusters command even higher amounts.
That is a very simple and normal principle.
This unspeakable debate is now finally over.
Finally, economic logic requires it too.
I believe this to be a very positive solution.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Childhood is not static.
We must also insist on periodic scientific reviews.
Â Â  .
Innovation plays a key role here.
Â Â  .
My heartfelt thanks, especially to MrÂ BÃ¶ge.
So what has changed?
And then we introduced a new principle.
Innovation is a name given to anything nowadays.
All sorts of things are labelled âinnovationâ.
But what is innovation?
Innovation is not invention.
We have wonderful ideas.
The Internet was basically invented in the European Union.
It blossomed, or its use blossomed, elsewhere.
My sincere thanks once again to all concerned.
This is an outstanding example of cooperation.
I have put the case for simplifying the procedures.
We have focused on industrial and intellectual property rights.
However, innovation does not stop there.
It could not have been more on time.
Â Â  .
We in our group support this proposal.
In many crucial areas our competitiveness is waning.
Â Â  Mr President, my thanks to MrÂ Chatzimarkakis.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The criteria in the Treaty cannot be changed.
The most obvious discussion relates to the inflation criterion.
This is laid down clearly in the Treaty.
Â Â  .
It has the support of Parliament.
Â Â  .
Other aspects of the assessment are also dubious.
Â Â  .
The voice of small countries must also be heard.
The European Union is based on democratic rules.
Â Â  .
Unfortunately, this is not the case.
It will be aÂ cold shower for future candidates.
The situation could be restored.
It lists known truths.
Â Â  .
Can the Treaty be modified?
Of course.
They are completely different things.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Hence our opposition to this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I would nevertheless like to make a few observations.
There may not be any principle at work here.
This seems somewhat frustrating.
Before that happens, no decisions can be made.
How we behave as an employer is important.
I hope that this issue will be raised again.
Â Â  .
Even half of that would be too much.â
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The Commission welcomes the majority of the amendments.
Comitology is a highly codified matter.
Thank you for your attention.
It is unnecessary to keep repeating it.
We must move forward and tackle the difficult issues.
To achieve this, I envisage a two-way communication.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
These communities are quite closed.
Â Â  .
That is our European point of view.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is a crucial element.
Other sources should also be used.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
This report comes at an extremely appropriate time.
We must not miss this great opportunity.
Â Â  .
I agree.
They can make a substantial difference towards market transformation.
All options should be seriously considered.
I congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent work.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Alongside ambitious targets we need ambitious energy-efficiency action plans.
Â Â  .
We must not be under-ambitious on energy efficiency.
Â Â  .
Commissioner, we will judge you on this.
Â Â  .
The Union lacks a transport energy efficiency policy.
Expensive energy teaches you a lesson.
What does it teach you?
It teaches you to save energy.
A case in point is the Galileo project.
Â Â  .
The Commission must fulfil Treaty obligations.
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
That is part of the budget-making procedure.
I cannot accept this argument.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The proposed framework decision will implement the following solutions:
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
What is this directive all about?
How does this work out in everyday life?
That is intolerable.
I do not believe that we do.
Â Â  .
I now propose to continue in English.
The Commission also approves this text.
I shall focus on three points.
What are we waiting for?
Â Â  .
Women want to work.
Not at all.
There has been no improvement in this area whatsoever.
Will the recast directive change this?
It remains to be seen.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.00 a.m.
At that time, we also formulated certain proposals.
Twelve people live in one room.
Â Â  .
There is also an awareness-raising programme and different campaigns.
This is the equivalent of aÂ medium-sized EU country.
I propose the adoption of the report.
Roma women are disadvantaged at every level.
Â Â  .
This is a bad thing.
However, today they are not represented.
We do them an injustice both socially and historically.
We also have them on the margins of history.
The sun shines on everyone.
The air is for everyone.
Water is for everyone.
We need to give them a place in society.
Reproductive rights is a key issue.
In this area, too, we need sanctions.
I should like to stress a couple of points.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
We need solidarity in combating poverty.
We need education and employment.
We need small region development.
What has happened since those reports were published?
It is unbearable!
We at least owe them that.
What is causing this?
What can we do now about all this?
Everything still remains to be done.
Thank you in advance for your support.
Â Â  .
Very often they are key players in promoting peace.
Gender aspects are there.
They have realised that bombs do not create peace.
Â Â  .
I shall just deal with two points.
Could you trust her or not?
Commissioner, you have demonstrated this.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  â We have noted your comment, MrÂ Schulz.
I ask you to stop doing this.
MrÂ Schulz and his colleagues have been misinformed.
Â Â  â The next item is Voting Time.
We know what the situation is in Guantanamo.
Consequently, I believe that we must vote today.
I hope that makes sense.
Â Â  Mr President, this is very simple.
This is not a criticism of the Commission.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have no confidence in this ridiculous voting system.
Â Â  It is very simple.
Â Â  .
â That concludes Voting Time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I have therefore voted against this report today.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am voting against the report as a whole.
What are we talking about then?
What a disgrace!
This initiative on its own disqualifies your proposal.
Â Â  .
Furthermore it has a twofold purpose:
- to make it compulsory to enforce them.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is what they would like.
We do not.
Â Â  .
New partnership?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Yet while doing so I would enter a reservation.
I am not against it in principle.
It really depends on other developments.
Before political integration?
We can only reject it.
Farewell Europe, hello World!
Â Â  .
The first of these is loyalty.
The second is international-level cooperation.
Â Â  .
A convergence rate also needs to be established.
That is obviously not the case.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have a social responsibility towards the poorest countries.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore support the Vidal-Quadras report.
Â Â  .
We are opposed to the liberalisation of energy markets.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ MartÃ­nez.
That is just utter nonsense.
Surely that is what is required.
Is that so or is it not?
Anything else would be nonsensical.
We do not need a plenary session.
Sometimes we cannot harmonise all agendas.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
The following amendment has been proposed.
We absolutely have to make a statement.
I am very surprised at this change.
(1)
Massacred, there is no other word for it.
I want our Parliament to take it up.
What does Turkey have to show here?
Almost nothing.
Â Â  Forced prostitution is a serious problem for Europe.
It was attended by Greeks, Bulgarians and Turks.
Adults are not participating satisfactorily in lifelong learning programmes.
Only those who work illegally have achieved mobility.
For the rest it is a utopia.
What is the real situation though?
I call on you to play a leading role.
Prevention is, undoubtedly, of the utmost importance.
We have serious questions to ask ourselves in Europe.
We must give the consumer the choice.
Sakchai is a new Scot and a new Shetlander.
This happened in June 1956.
Perhaps that would encourage more discipline.
They must wonder which debate we are actually on.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrÂ Corbett.
Â Â  .
We are a solution-based committee.
I mention some key points in my report.
We cannot thank them enough.
Â Â  .
The petitions procedure concerns the individual and their parliament.
So each procedure is different in nature.
That brings me to the second point.
This is important for transparency.
Let me just say one thing about that.
We have several examples of that.
Â Â  .
The message that citizens are sending is clear.
They demand more transparency and more openness from us.
Â Â  .
We have to bring an end to this.
Then the other item: clearer citizen-inspired legislation.
Finland already uses citizensâ summaries or executive summaries.
Â Â  .
This is extremely important.
âBrussels is too far from here!â
I would like to add a couple of comments.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, yes.
Congratulations Michael.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is about better quality laws and better redress.
Thank you very much for this discussion.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Furthermore, I should like to emphasise three points.
The first is a matter of semantics.
Speaking of forced prostitution is a euphemism.
These words, however, conceal the reality.
Forced prostitution deserves to be openly condemned.
All governments should sign this convention and ratify it.
We are facing a medium-Â and long-term problem.
This report is of course available to Parliament.
However, we still just keep on going.
That is what we now have to focus on.
Commissioner, you spoke about the telephone helpline.
Regrettably there is no single number.
You have talked about enhanced cooperation with Europol.
That too must remain a central issue.
There are good opportunities to do this.
No customers means no demand.
I am not making any ethical judgments about prostitution.
These are entirely political issues.
No one should have to prostitute themselves.
In 1999 there were 4Â 000 child prostitutes.
By 2001 this number had risen to 15Â 000.
It is not an issue we should wave aside.
We must learn for the future.
Europe is not present at the World Cup championship.
This will not do.
I wish you all the best!
Why?
Football and sex do not go hand in hand.
Lastly, we need clear strategies focused on objectives.
80% suffer from chronic depression.
There has been much discussion of telephone helplines.
They have promised 24-hour cover during this period.
Much has also been said about communication and information.
The victims are victims, not illegal immigrants.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Only four additional amendments have been submitted.
Improvements are desperately needed in some areas.
The groundwater ecosystem as such must be protected.
Investments in water-management enterprises are recommended.
Groundwater is also of great environmental value.
The proposed framework directive complements the Water Framework Directive.
There are two keys.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Aspirations are just a figment of Brusselsâ imagination.
We imposed legal requirements upon Member States.
It struck me as rather odd.
That is another point at issue in this vote.
We must vote accordingly.
That is not an option.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is also a back-up supply for future generations.
I look forward to his response.
Prevention is therefore of the essence.
The nitrate directive springs to mind, in particular.
Imagine the following situation arises.
Which directive will prevail in that case?
Hence my amendments.
Well, thank you very much indeed.
The attacks on our clean water continue.
What happens, however?
This is, in my view, entirely unacceptable.
This will not work.
Many of the wells had to be closed.
I can enthusiastically endorse 99% of her report.
It is certainly not enough.
Why?
This is really a Community-level issue.
All is not lost yet, however.
I wish her well in maintaining her resilient stance.
What should groundwater comprise apart from water?
I support the draft directive.
Our record in transposing environmental directives is not good.
Perhaps the Commission could clarify this issue.
As such, the above amendments cannot be accepted.
Â Â  .
Perhaps the translation has confused the issue somewhat.
Could you explain what you said, Commissioner?
Â Â  We have accepted those amendments.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at noon.
Â Â  .
Allow me to give you a few examples.
Let me list the most important ones for you.
Downloading for free is not an issue.
It is possible, but not compulsory.
Again it is an issue.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment 15.
Fortunately, we did not start from zero.
The principle of solidarity is also important.
Â Â  .
That is my firm conviction.
That is subsidiarity; that is flexibility.
MrÂ Dimas said that we should be ambitious.
I should like to focus on two specific points.
The draft must be adjusted accordingly.
Â Â  .
My congratulations to him.
We have to protect them against contamination.
Â Â  .
I myself live six metres below sea level.
Specific measures can help prevent this damage.
Hence my support for Amendments 61 and 62.
The directives support all these activities.
The floods later affected other European countries.
An increasing number of people are faced with floods.
My second comment is about subsidiarity.
There is every reason for this.
Rivers and streams must be given more space again.
People working in this field welcome the directive.
Floods do not stop at borders.
I am therefore torn between these two positions.
Flood prevention is a classic example of solidarity.
It could go a bit further in this direction.
No region ever gets used to floods.
Â Â  .
The Commission cannot accept them.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Unfortunately, that was not the case.
There is a different reality demanding different responses.
That is the case of tourism.
That is not good enough, Commissioner.
Is it because it does not agree?
Is it because it considers it pointless?
âExplore the opportunity to promote awarenessâ?
Tourism is a subsidiarity field .
The Commission communication is not ambitious.
Â Â  .
I thank MrÂ QueirÃ³ for raising this issue.
What am I trying to say?
The most sustainable form of travel is the train.
Â Â  .
It brings challenges that we have to face.
These regions require a special, carefully thought-out programme.
It is hard to associate tourism with the night.
Tourism represents wealth in many regards.
Tourism is an important generator of employment.
The wealth generated by tourism is not purely economic.
Â Â  â Thank you Mr President.
How far has this streamlining process come?
Thank you.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The next item is the joint debate on:
Â Â  .
We will quickly come to an agreement on those.
Some amendments create difficulties for the Commission.
That we got it wrong in the first place?
I simply cannot accept that logic.
This Parliament has truly made excellent progress.
I hope we can maintain this momentum.
Time matters!
Together we can prove that Lisbon is back again.
Â Â  .
I will name the four most important ones.
We strongly support European technology platforms.
It has shown great maturity and political responsibility.
Â Â  .
We support this compromise.
Â Â  .
This is an enormous improvement.
I have one negative comment to make.
Â Â  .
I shouldÂ ...
MrÂ Sakalas clearly speaks on his own behalf.
Â Â  .
Once again, my congratulations on your work.
Â Â  .
That is where the future lies.
The first challenge: basic and fundamental science.
We are delighted; that is an important challenge.
We have the challenge of innovation.
We are going to promote this exchange of information.
We are going to promote this flow of information.
Another challenge has been the environmental crisis.
This also stems from our current energy crisis.
It is also a transparency problem.
That information has not been available so far.
They are worse than useless.
Wave power only works in specific geographic locations.
Other alternative methods are equally ineffective.
That would be money much better spent.
Nevertheless, we still have some concerns.
In reality it is a flagship programme.
My group attaches considerable importance to freedom of research.
Our only interdiction is against human cloning.
I am obliged to him for this.
The research needed, however, should be completed.
This is something that new IVF technology makes easier.
These results are useful for therapeutic purposes.
Why is that the case?
This will not generate profits for pharmaceutical companies.
We must support MrÂ Garganiâs amendments.
Europe is weak.
Our children would not forgive us if it did.
These are the conditions for achieving the Lisbon objectives.
A final recommendation concerns embryonic stem cells.
That is what AmendmentÂ 66 proposes.
We should, emphatically, be doing the opposite.
We need this Research Council.
It will make Europe more attractive to top researchers.
We shall carry on working.
Congratulations, MrÂ PotoÄnik.
My warmest congratulations to our rapporteur, MrÂ Buzek.
AmendmentÂ 66 on embryonic stem cells.
Shall we achieve this, however?
In fact I am against human cloning.
There is not even a basic exchange of information.
JesusÂ Christ related the parable of the Good Samaritan.
Thank you.
I do not support AmendmentÂ 66 to ArticleÂ 6.
The amendment also includes a revision clause.
That is why I shall emphasise only three points.
We must act in accordance with these considerations.
Yes, I am in favour of this research.
It is time to change these proportions!
I think he is absolutely right.
I think that is highly problematic.
I do not think we should do that.
Â Â  â I should like to highlight a few points.
That is a different tune.
It can be done.
I have a question for CommissionerÂ PotoÄnik.
I have not many early indications as yet.
The health programme is also important.
Cooperation is at least equally important.
I believe that we need three conditions here.
These cuts are extremely problematic.
Â Â  .
We have too little crude oil and gas.
We cannot reject any of these.
Thank you to CommissionerÂ PotoÄnik for his excellent collaboration.
I shall start with the budget and budgetary structure.
We all agree on this.
That is their clear answer.
We have to improve capacities there.
It is crucial that we understand that.
Technology platforms have vast potential.
They will be a crucial factor.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Any budgetary cuts are therefore to be avoided.
Our long-term responsibility is huge.
Â Â  â The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you.
Â Â  .
â That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
They have failed to do so up to now.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is why I have voted for this report.
That would have made more sense.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I will be voting for this resolution.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
For that to happen, justice must be done.
Â Â  .
Thank you once again.
It is not a certainty.
Â Â  .
Awareness is an absolute prerequisite for responsible decision-making.
Â Â  .
I should like to add three comments.
We have not really given this enough consideration yet.
This is just one example.
I am right behind him on that.
Â Â  .
We will need to invest in overcoming national chauvinism.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Farms had disinfectant baths and carpets at all entrances.
I want to highlight three aspects.
The first is vaccine research.
The stockpile of antivirals is not enough, however.
I congratulate Mr Adamou on this excellent report.
The European Union must take a firm stance.
They have to exist first.
What will we say when a pandemic occurs?
Let each government commit to showing solidarity!
We are currently in alert phase 3.
I very much support what he has said today.
They say that problems always start at the top.
I congratulate MrÂ Adamou for his own-initiative report.
Â Â  .
Cooperation is very important.
It is true that progress was slow.
I am optimistic that things will speed up now.
We need cooperation and coordination.
Antivirals are certainly a debated issue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The funds allocated to the associations are still frozen.
The judiciary is still being repressed.
That is unacceptable.
The time has come, therefore, to react.
Â Â  .
That is not our role.
That is strange to say the least.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
International issues were discussed in depth at the summit.
Â Â  .
Three elements are important in this.
Energy has already been mentioned.
This year is a good time for this.
All this is obvious.
That is the task for which we were elected.
Â Â  .
What did we awake to?
The establishment of good relations is a two-way process.
No other documents were signed.
Neither was any joint statement made.
What then could be done about this?
The problem could initially be solved with supply contracts.
Things are moving backwards, not forwards.
But it is not always so.
I have specific questions for the Commissioner.
Did you put pressure on the Russians?
Commissioner Rehn has raised the question of interdependence.
Can that result in self-sustaining economic development?
Joint venture companies in Germany are working extremely well.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I fully agree with Mr Winkler in that regard.
We want both human rights and energy.
How can we do that?
We need principles, pragmatism and partnership.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
We will take the following questions to the Commission.
Seventeen organisations were against what was proposed.
That is a monologue, not a dialogue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Commissioner, what about the indigenous peoples?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
You said that this House would be kept informed.
Â Â  .
The European Parliament will also participate in this consultation.
The closing date for submissions was 12Â April 2006.
Â Â  I am very pleased to hear that, Commissioner.
Should Parliament have codecision?
Â Â  .
However, I personally favour codecision.
The company wants Google to filter this suggestion.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for your response.
That is the situation under existing law.
Does it intend to propose any measures?
So it is now also up to them.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Let there be no misunderstanding about that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Commission is monitoring these developments closely.
So we are aware of your point.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We are also funding various research projects.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It provides relevant protection.
We have new legislation in place.
This covers pressure selling.
Some of them could be relevant to car hire.
Â Â  .
Very briefly, I agree with the honourable Member.
Â Â  .
We are following this issue.
In that effort also, we will support Poland.
Polish exporters have incurred extremely serious financial losses.
Â Â  .
It has to implement them as well.
Â Â  .
I am not aware of it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There is no state religion in Nigeria.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Already EUR 1.5 billion of that has been spent.
If so, how extensive are they?
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time.
What, though, are the consequences now?
I thank the House most warmly for its attention.
All of which illustrates our lack of courage.
This is utterly iniquitous.
Where, now, are the differences of opinion?
Â Â  .
Violation by whom?
It is not a trivial matter.
This contradicts what we were told at the time.
Allow me to act as its spokesperson this evening.
There are no longer any intergovernmental powers in Europe.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The concrete time schedule might need further examination.
We came to the right decision together.
Â Â  .
Again, it gives clarity and facilitates communication.
Â Â  Mr President, this framework decision is undoubtedly necessary.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The initiative will facilitate the social rehabilitation of offenders.
Â Â  .
This is something that I would like to stress.
Â Â  .
Commissioner, I have a little story for you.
They have committed the same crime.
They have received identical sentences.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
These are data from the Lisbon monitoring centre itself.
This Commission proposal covers a number of aspects.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Is that something that helps?
Have we ever really investigated this?
We have not discussed any of that, unfortunately.
Â Â  .
Let us accept that.
Â Â  .
This policy continues to this day.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
What are the key elements of the framework strategy?
We also stress the need for supplementary legislation.
Â Â  .
This topic deserves greater attention.
Mrs Å½danokaâs report does that.
It is another step forward.
She talks about active intervention and positive action.
Positive action is one of the most misunderstood concepts.
Why?
ArticleÂ 13 contains an important concept.
It is important.
We cannot ignore this issue.
Â Â  .
They were very ambitious.
Those are, after all, our shared values.
That is an absolute disgrace.
We urgently need concrete measures.
We need legislation.
We need this framework decision.
All of that we would qualify as better lawmaking.
That is also in Mrs Å½danokaâs report.
Â Â  .
And we need data.
I welcome both the debate and this report.
And now about the true situation of non-citizens.
Non-citizens in Latvia have all these rights.
Maori children were significantly underachieving at school.
I think that this situation is truly untenable.
This is a particularly important report.
Two points trouble us in particular.
Â Â  .
European legislation facilitates such positive measures.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The forthcoming Summit will be a working Summit.
Â Â  .
What stage are we at?
What can we do to move Europe forward?
What can one expect from the European Council?
What has caused this Euro-pessimism?
Let us be clear, Nice is not enough.
Despite everything, we have already achieved certain things.
No.
This is a major issue.
These are two key priorities.
What are we proposing on this issue?
That is what we are going to do.
It was signed by the Foreign Affairs Ministers.
That is no longer possible today.
I do not think so.
Let us hold a debate on enlargement.
That is the Europe that I so earnestly desire.
That is the great project for Europe.
The Austrian Presidency has revived the constitutional debate.
We need to have succeeded by 2009.
We cannot get around this point.
We believe that public involvement should be increased.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶mâs PlanÂ D is good.
We have had a very successful interparliamentary forum.
And that goes beyond any period of reflection.
My second comment concerns security in Europe.
A further point concerns the Lisbon Strategy.
I have a suggestion for France.
We welcome the draft conclusions on Romania and Bulgaria.
So there are two options: renegotiation or oblivion.
They now need to sit down to the meat.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is won.
Let us turn now to the European energy policy.
The field of security is not doing too badly.
There is a very great lack of this.
This has to change.
I cannot understand it.â
The roles of Romania and Bulgaria are clear.
We would reiterate that request now.
I wish him every success in this.
The citizens are not speaking about all of this.
The President is mixing up cause and effect.
They want to rule Europe as a sideline.
These are the causes of the pessimism among Europeans.
That is unacceptable â corrections must be made.
Â Â  I am sorry.
Could people please stick to their speaking time.
What has she got to hide?
That will not be possible.
We need to face this fact.
The country has long deserved its own negotiations.
Why, then, this deafening silence?
It is simply not good enough.
I would add: social justice and equity.
So much for democracy!
So much for the rule of law!
The voters are starting to notice.
I have just quoted MrÂ Solana.
Energy will dictate our international relations policy.
What should be done?
The Union cannot overlook any course of action.
All forms of research must be encouraged.
Procrastination is not a credible policy.
In fact, we have little choice.
The European Union gives hope to minorities.
Please do not disappoint them.
The question is whether that is true.
The draft Constitution was rejected by large majorities.
The people of France and Holland are wrong.
The Constitution should be brought backâ.
We congratulate you on it.
The Convention obtained a result that cannot be overturned.
We must go beyond Nice.
What should the content of the European policies be?
We want a Europe that builds.
Â Â  Mr President, Poland supports the Constitutional Treaty.
Do not listen to Polish politicians.
Listen instead to public opinion in Poland.
Over 60% of Poles support the Constitutional Treaty.
First of all, there is Strasbourg.
However, what should we do at this point?
This is something the subsequent presidencies should also address.
This lies in the hands of the European Commission.
Who is in charge?
Well done.
It applies everywhere in Europe except to the Aegean.
Well done.
Which country is threatening Europe?
Only Turkey in the Aegean with its .
Well done.
Which country is violating Europe?
Is it Russia?
No, it is not.
It is Turkey every day in the Aegean.
Well done.
Which country does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus?
It is Turkey.
Well done.
It is Turkey.
Well done.
In Turkey and you tolerate it.
Well done.
It only lasted for 51 years, however.
Why was that?
MrÂ Barroso, I agree with you.
That spectre fuels the one you mentioned.
We need a revival, advances and progress.
It hinges on policies.
Which reforms?
We need initiatives.
There is never a dull moment with Europa.
What is it we want from Europa?
What do we expect of her?
We certainly have a clear idea.
No one understands Europe.
What does it spend all its time doing anyway?
This is impossible when the Council Presidency rotates biannually.
That is very unfortunate.
The European party structure is completely out of date.
The establishment must represent the people.
Fear of enlargement provides bad counsel.
Today, in Belarus, we support civil society.
It is an invaluable ally for the European Union.
Mr Barroso, I like to see you fighting.
What is going on in the Council?
We need a new treaty to have greater transparency.
That is a very important signal to send out.
They deserve it and Europe needs them.
It is true.
Europe is not in crisis.
We must not allow ourselves to believe that.
We shall be voting on Parliament's proposal today.
I do not know where that is coming from.
People want more control over their own lives.
That is how we make progress.
They have not vanished overnight and need solving.
However, all this will emerge in due course.
Now is not the time to make that choice.
That is essential.
Sometimes we have a tendency to lose perspective.
Deepening and widening go hand in hand.
Nice is not enough.
How is the same standard applied in this case?
What kind of Europe is this going to be?
What is the vision here?
This is the real, but negative item.
Well done, Mr Barroso.
Â Â  .
We have made a great deal of effort.
MrsÂ Resetarits once again talked about Zeus and Europa.
Â Â  .
We need to rally together all the Member States.
These days, we need to involve the citizens.
All the Member States say we need greater cooperation.
The same applies to research.
I hope that the Council will do that.
So, let us be proud of Europe.
Let us be proud of Europe.
That is our great project for Europe.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12.30.
Â Â  The future of Europe is a very important matter.
Should the period of reflection be extended?
This is not an easy task.
It is also important to be honest with Europeans.
We should be more modest.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
I just wanted to draw your attention to that.
This is for two reasons.
That concludes voting time.
We have thus voted against wordings along these lines.
Â Â  .
Thirteen years later, the results are not impressive.
Quite the contrary, in fact.
One thing is to be noted.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  This report concerns an eminently cross-border issue.
Â Â  .
I accordingly voted in favour of the Amadou report.
What are the judges thinking of?
Â Â  .
There is worse to come, however.
Â Â  .
That is why we voted against the report.
This left-wing discourse has only exacerbated the problems.
What we need is a complete change of course.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Let me be clear.
They suffer from social exclusion.
Â Â  .
Our demands are justified and have yielded results.
That is true.
Â Â  .
Let us give ourselves the chance to make progress.
I do not believe that they are.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The European Union cannot do without this debate.
Have you heard?
Have you been listening?
Have you understood?
Of that there can be no doubt.
Â Â  .
The issue of our roots also remains unresolved.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Certainly, votes can be corrected.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the following:
We should reflect on this in the long term.
Perhaps that is something to consider in future.
But what if they are not?
We need more indicators.
Â Â  .
Our experience is quite the opposite.
Â Â  .
That should also be the message to the Council.
Â Â  .
The first word is integration.
The second word is governance.
Finally, the third word is monitoring.
Sustainable development is an over-arching objective of the Union.
For both we need to act.
The priority now is to achieve results.
We must move from words to action.
Some say that we are not ambitious enough.
I disagree.
The European Union institutions cannot achieve sustainable development alone.
The problems are interlinked and so are the solutions.
Â Â  .
Why do I say this?
It does not make that clear.
Â Â  .
The decisions already taken should also be implemented.
Instead, it has returned to completely outdated notions.
Â Â  .
There is, however, a PPE-DE one-sizing problem.
I think that this was a mistake.
We were expecting more substance and more proposals.
Sustainable development now sounds hollow.
What has become of harmonisation?
No progress is being made.
Where are the practical proposals?
Â Â  Mr President, sustainable development is a nice idea.
Look at Africa!
Who could possibly be opposed to it?
They are linked together rather than integrated.
We are not opposed to the strategy.
Sustainable growth is the only growth we can afford.
We are also aiming at the wrong goals.
Sustainable development is not only about the environment.
Why is that the case?
People listening to us are amazed.
Why do we not take the relevant decisions?
Then, we shall obtain sustainable development.
The resolution is clear.
Â Â  .
Investing in new targets may not be too difficult.
Sustainable development is about a coherent approach to policy-making.
The Commission will report on progress every two years.
The debate is closed.
They deserve our full support.
Â Â  .
We must distinguish between these situations.
It is dangerous to lump everything together.
Â Â  .
What, then, have we set up instead?
I was very happy to be part of that.
That has been mentioned before in this House.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mr President, justice requires reason and prudence.
Â Â  .
If not, what is all the fuss about?
We must check our facts first.
Now they are not.
Yes, we are against promoting homosexuality in Poland.
We are against promoting immoral behaviour.
It is worth looking at the 2005 report.
What can we learn from this text?
I would repeat: all over Europe.
We must now move on to actions.
The time has come to act.
My custom is to end on an optimistic note.
National governments and other institutions must respond adequately.
Because of time constraints I will not list them.
That is beyond dispute.
It is absolutely stuff!
Sorry about that.
To me this resolution is about four things.
We need action.
Public opinion-makers must not create a climate of racism.
Prosecution of groups that foster racism must be encouraged.
Racism is a multisided, multidimensional problem.
Why are parades necessary?
They are also a form of oppression.
I have heard traditional values referred to.
There is none.
We stand by that.
We will defend that.
Our citizens must be very puzzled.
Is it complacency?
Is it ignorance?
Is it a lack of political will?
Horror is never far away.
You never forget it once it happens.
Will it stop the hatred?
No, it will not.
That is a deep shame.
Let us do something about it.
This freedom is not always respected.
All this is entirely to be condemned.
Religion is frequently used as an excuse.
We have to find a common language.
That is very important.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on
Â Â  .
It is something much more important.
It is life.
I also want to thank you for your comments.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Their long-term impact on sustainable development is undeniable.
I will just mention the example of Nepal.
Weapons were exported from EU Member States to Nepal.
Every weapons export is a threat to peace.
The debate is closed.
The following questions have been submitted to the Council.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Different rhythms of negotiation will come about automatically.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Have they been solved yet?
When are we expecting a response from the Iranians?
Â Â  .
You have practically given the answer yourself.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Winkler.
Your reply is satisfactory, of course.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Are you thinking along these lines?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you for your answer.
I would like to ask you another question.
If yes, then what are those interests?
Â Â  .
Â Â  I would like to ask the minister a question.
Â Â  .
We cannot find any of those.
Â Â  .
I beg your indulgence.
I really cannot give you an answer.
Â Â  .
Certification and labelling are core issues.
I am very optimistic.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I do not see it like that.
Â Â  Question No 8 by Earn Ryan has been withdrawn.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
Â Â  .
I regard that scenario as absolutely necessary.
What we really need is an evaluation of potential.
Â Â  â Of course I am satisfied with your answer.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time.
We must meet that expectation.
Â Â  .
Different industries face different threats necessitating different security measures.
In general I welcome this proposal.
Â Â  .
We too have tabled two amendments.
Â Â  .
Such measures are currently covered only by ICAO provisions.
This is not accurate.
Â Â  .
Appropriate training for personnel is also required.
This regulation must not make it inaccessible.
I applaud the report.
Subsidiarity is being undermined slowly but surely.
Our differences therefore lie in the methods used.
Is this really the case, however?
Let me move on to the funding of security.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
You spared no effort, MrÂ Cramer!
Â Â  .
It is all set out very clearly.
Â Â  .
We desperately need a common electronic protection system.
Â Â  .
This represents prospects for industry and more employment.
On the contrary, the gap has widened.
I shall restrict myself to four remarks.
My fourth remark concerns the corridors.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  .
The subject matter is vast and varied.
I believe that anomaly has to be corrected.
It is about promoting sustainable fishing.
Â Â  .
Let me now turn to your specific suggestions.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Secondly, the lack of young people.
Training must go further, however.
Â Â  .
My group has two objections, though.
Â Â  .
Broadly speaking, we welcome this report.
Against this backdrop, we tabled two amendments.
This is where I part company with the rapporteur.
I disagree, for two reasons.
I support the rapporteurâs recommendations.
This problem is that of inshore fishing.
The appeal for action is thus entirely justified.
Inshore fishing is of great importance.
These two statistics tell us a great deal.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
It is important that such an industry thrives.
Â Â  .
We have more than met that obligation.
On all the key points we agree.
Our financial markets are in good shape.
The European financial landscape is becoming commercially more attractive.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I believe that I really must stress this.
This is not the first time this has happened.
We should adopt something to this effect.
We are keen to debate this with him.
Â Â  .
I congratulate everyone for achieving this result.
If accepted, the amendment could weaken transparency requirements.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The report is of course a reflection of reality.
What are the main elements of the OLAF reform?
Of this total, 85-90 % were counterfeit.
OLAF has completed all but one of the inquiries.
I would like to make two brief points.
Afterwards is always too late.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mr BÃ¶sch, first of all, thank you.
What now though?
Even more important is the prevention of fraud.
This matter should be resolved systematically.
â¦on their head harmed due to racist accusations.
This is not being done.
There are hidden connections of which we are unaware.
This is a situation that must be changed.
Clearly, this report falls short of those proposals.
I would like to assure you of our support.
This must be followed up by action.
Another huge waste.
The whole system has fallen into contempt.
This problem is the result of two facts.
The other is that there is not enough transparency.
Secondly, the situation calls for greater transparency.
Everyone talks about transparency.
Fortunately, something is happening.
This is a step in the right direction.
Is Turkey to join?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
They also share common social and political values.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
We must not slow down the pace.
We shall attend to this in due course.
It is not a technical issue.
The amendment would read as follows:
I hope the House can accept this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I must insist.
It is as simple as that.
Â Â  We have now finished voting.
This applies especially to medium and small enterprises.
Congratulations to everybody.
Â Â  .
It should be continued.
This approach should also be continued.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I voted for this report.
Â Â  .
We cannot allow any remaining doubts on this matter.
This semi-legitimation is dangerous.
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  I totally oppose research on human embryos.
I voted for the Gargani/ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ amendments.
These amendments were defeated.
This is the most unacceptable position for me.
I voted against this.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is a compromise amendment.
Â Â  .
Adopting the euro is not a good idea.
As Frenchmen we know this.
Nor do we recommend other countries to do so.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Our policies must deliver for everyone.
Allow me to say a few words on it.
We should not be handing out marks to them.
Such drove me to vote against the resolution.
Â Â  .
All too soon I have been proved right.
It is crucial to condemn them publicly.
Â Â  .
Homophobia and racism have no place in Europe.
I therefore voted for the motion for a resolution.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the resolution.
Consequently, we have abstained on the final vote.
To name but two of these:
This is a welcome step.
This positive vote today is part of that process.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â All forms of human violence must be condemned.
National laws underpin these rights.
Â Â  .
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Of these I should like to highlight:
fisheries;
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
The Commission cannot interfere with these domestic powers.
I shall summarise it for you:
But who is protecting European wine?
We are calling for your help.
Otherwise we shall have a very tough dialogue.
Why should this be, you ask?
Why should they?
They look to the bottle for information.
The Pomerol is sadly lacking in information.
That would deal with the competition problem.
That strikes me as crucial.
We need clarity in this area.
There is a clear need for action.
Did I understand him correctly?
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The latest member of the ACP is East Timor.
The Commissioner will doubtless largely agree with us.
What lessons emerge from this for the donor countries?
The political situation in the country is very complicated.
What can the European Commission do?
There has clearly been some progress.
In this regard our support will continue.
The report from this Commission was published in 2005.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
We must support Syriaâs democratic opposition.
He arrived at Damascus airport and was imprisoned.
He was therefore immediately imprisoned.
Our responsibility for their imprisonment is clear.
Let us be responsible for their freedom.
We are not seen as having clean hands.
It is a crazy world, right enough.
We are not seen as being the good guys.
The conditions in which prisoners are held must change.
We cannot remain inactive in view of this.
The government released hundreds of political prisoners.
At the time we warmly welcomed these positive steps.
They have peaceful intentions.
Making public declarations is not enough, of course.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
The date of the execution is not known.
Son Jong Nam is an innocent man.
All he did was exercise his human rights.
Â Â  .
The success stories were followed by the food shortage.
My group welcomes this approach.
Â Â  .
We must speak openly about this political archaeological site.
We must support the diplomatic activities of the Troika.
The issue is still under discussion.
Of this I am in no doubt.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  â This oral amendment has obtained cross-group consensus.
The amendment is aimed at expressing this request.
The paragraph would therefore read as follows:
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
His death is a loss to all of us.
Â Â  .
We have made a start on the energy policy.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  .
That was not yet possible and I regret that.
Enlargement is a profoundly important issue for our Union.
It must include a commitment to deliver.
We cannot be complacent.
Â Â  .
The constitution has now been mentioned.
Everything is connected.
We must achieve a result in the Middle East.
We must look to the future.
Now to my final remark.
Â Â  .
Thank you very much for this, MrÂ Winkler.
Our parliament has amended the Services Directive.
The specific work undertaken in the Councils is working.
The key point is that they do it furtively.
The tone of the Austrian Presidency has been calm.
The citizensâ initiative www.oneseat.eu continues.
What results do we see today?
We are the only ones not doing so.
That is the only route to take.
Â Â  .
That was the praise; now for the criticism.
That way, it is the citizens who decide.
That is even worse than .
What does the closing balance look like?
A great deal has been promised.
What has actually changed?
You yourself mentioned the issue of the referendums.
What has become of those?
Now we no longer hear about them.
Yet there is also silence on this matter now.
That will not do.
That will not do either.
We are attacking again.
I should particularly like to single out Secretary-of-State Winkler.
Europe needed them as a matter of real urgency.
Everything was postponed and put off.
However, this did not affect nuclear research.
Greater transparency equals better democracy.
This list amounts to a great deal.
What exactly has it achieved?
What does this phrase actually mean?
Expansion must not be used as a scapegoat.
Political leadership means forming, leading and shaping opinion.
ChancellorÂ SchÃ¼ssel, have you signed the proposal?
We need to alter our transport policy.
The message is loud and clear.
I think I can remember some of the words:
Our colleague has settled in over this period.
I think we still need to revise our ideas.
This joint responsibility must be revived and strengthened.
An agreement has been reached on the financial perspectives.
We support this wholeheartedly.
Simply because the government in France will have changed?
You will do it again.
How is that for symbolism?
I am just floating the idea.
Think about it!
Let us stop whining and blaming.
We are actually doing quite well.
We need concrete actions.
You know what is needed.
I believe it has been just that.
We wish them all the best in the process.
(Applause)
But what should this role be?
This reveals the weaknesses of our decision-making structures.
We have fought for that.
You have brought the Constitutional Treaty back on track.
This is something we need to debate.
You are meeting the Americans today and tomorrow.
Perhaps we can set the ball rolling today.
Firstly, the issue of the US summit.
We are surely all aware of that.
Foreign policy is also important.
These issues are being discussed.
Secondly, I turn to the subject of transparency.
Europe was born in the coffee houses of Europe.
We are also exploiting the new media.
This has nothing to do with self-congratulation.
I turn now to the subject of enlargement.
It was sometimes an uphill struggle.
I am very happy about this.
That is to say, it is only right.
Today it is half that.
This is a win-win situation.
We must speak truthfully.
Allow me to speak openly here.
We need some new elements.
We all know this.
People must already be aware of that.
That is why this Messina-type declaration is quite important.
Why was there some opposition to this Constitutional Treaty?
I am of a different opinion.
Nobody knows about them, however.
That is democracy, after all.
I wish them well.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
The following amendment has been proposed.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrsÂ Krupa.
It does not have even 100Â metres of intersections.
So we need to do something.
We need to do something.
We have case law.
We have to call a spade a spade.
It must be respected and protectedâ?
The priest is injured but has survived the attack.
I am not the only one who is worried.
Â Â  Thank you, MrsÂ Badia.
How is that possible?
I will give you just one example.
This company has been in operation for 16 years.
The Irish peace process is at a critical juncture.
Was it foolishness or something else?
It does not matter.
That is something we cannot support.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  .
Did we the institutions get it right?
Did the Member States get it right?
How can we do better in the future?
This brings me to the particular aspect.
Hence we will need a little more time.
Their stories have been heartrending.
It does not always fit.
Where is this in a country-of-origin regime?
I should jolly well hope so!
Â Â  .
The committee continues to collect evidence.
Â Â  .
The Commission needs to address this.
Â Â  .
It did not choose to do so.
Â Â  .
The first is about solvency.
I doubt whether this has happened.
Â Â  .
Insurance matters are incredibly sensitive issues.
That includes many of the most important witnesses.
Even their answers to specific questions were evasive.
If they were, they were saying nothing.
So, the Irish were kept in ignorance.
That is a problem.
Were others notified?
That is a key question.
Finally, who is regulating the regulators?
Is it the Commission?
I commend Mrs Wallisâs report.
It is a very thorough interim report.
I look forward to what he has to say.
Â Â  .
The single market offers advantages for consumers.
In a single market, supervisors should cooperate.
Both supervisors have roles to play.
That is definitely something that we need to address.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
However, the growing crisis was concealed from policyholders.
The regulators failed.
The regulators failed.
Â Â  , .
We have four messages to put across.
Is there no solution at all?
There is another point related to this.
My colleagues will be addressing other matters.
Â Â  .
It brings a substantial contribution to the debate.
There are strong commercial pressures driving consolidation.
How is the European banking sector structured?
Â Â  .
Supervisory authorities must, of course, have teeth.
Recent cases have clearly illustrated this defect.
Let us set aside our national spectacles.
Â Â  .
Banking, like any other business, is risky.
Nobody has thought this through.
This is a time of very significant changes.
That is the task that we must carry out.
Of course not everybody agrees with that analysis.
What would be the consequences for the European market?
I doubt it.
This overturns the balance in the services sector.
These principles must be proclaimed.
Because doing nothing is not a liberal position.
Â Â  Mr President, I only have two points.
I ask that question of Mr McCreevy.
Â Â  .
Mrs van den Burg raised a number of questions.
Well, I believe it is.
I do not agree with her.
That is a matter entirely for them.
The market should decide that.
I have read what he said in his book.
There is a reason for that.
We should not always be so defensive.
Mr HÃ¶kmark and others referred to the regulatory matter.
I would agree with what they say.
That is what our interest is going to be.
Some very precise questions were put to him.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
I understand the concerns raised on international issues.
These contacts have so far been positive.
Â Â  .
It is therefore high time we abolished this exemption.
Our economy and development plan are based on competition.
I deplore that.
That is a political choice with serious consequences.
In my opinion, that would have been preferable.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It will help combating money laundering and terrorist financing.
I look forward to hearing your comments.
I can quite understand his reaction.
I am honestly convinced of that.
That is an absolute must.
There might be other ways to achieve that goal.
Yet we are starting to think things over.
These things are steadily escalating.
Both committees did their best to find proper answers.
Allow me to make one more point.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The effectiveness of all those measures is questionable.
One of the problems is posed by donations.
This measure aims to limit financial freedom.
I am sure it cannot do that!
Â Â  .
Terrorist acts can be organised with little money.
No problems were detected on data protection issues.
The compromise found is a good one.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Annex â Position of the Commission
Â Â  .
However, this should not be the only aim.
Â Â  .
Our consultation has been successful.
What are the main lessons of the consultation?
Respondents praised the consultation exercise.
A majority of respondents supported the objective of simplification.
However, most stakeholders considered a recasting exercise inappropriate.
A number of respondents expressed âregulatory fatigueâ.
I have heard the views expressed.
Our views are mostly convergent.
I welcome that.
This is a good example of a sound compromise.
Ownership is the very basis of the market economy.
Do not allow market forces to be eliminated.
Businesses need fixed, long-term ground rules.
There can be no guarantee of objectivity.
Instead, it can be renewed.
Pacta sunt servanda.
I shall return to this point in isolation later.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
It is clear then that action is urgently needed.
Â Â  .
It is environmentally effective and economically efficient.
Long-distance rail transport is stagnating.
Â Â  .
That is a fantastic and terrible rate of growth.
Our growth and our profits must be protected.
Do not take measures against us.
I think they should look at this again.
Technological development is what we really need to promote.
Â Â  .
This cannot be allowed to continue.
Every one of us can do something too.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Is this an inevitable process?
I hope not.
However, pioneering actions always involve risks.
The principle and the objective are clear.
What do those problems in aviation amount to?
I would welcome initiatives to that effect, Commissioner.
Flying is unnaturally cheap.
Aviation is expanding rapidly.
Let us try to reduce them, Commissioner.
Aviation facilitates social cohesion and cultural exchange.
It is not directly included in the Kyoto Protocol.
Do we need legislation?
Do not hold your breath.
They are outmoded and overloaded.
I am much obliged to the rapporteur.
We cannot wait any longer.
That conflicts with our Lisbon Strategy.
Why is that the case?
Would we need further schemes?
This does not make any sense.
It makes sense to do it that way.
This deadline expired a long time ago.
Our proposal moves in precisely this direction.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
We nevertheless negotiated a good compromise.
We must monitor this situation.
Â Â  .
Well, Aarhus translates our words into action.
Â Â  .
Is there anything you can do to help us?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Mr President, finally, the moment had arrived.
What have we now achieved?
This also applies to those supplied in the past.
There are alternatives, which may be reusable.
This is clearly a good thing.
Once again, flexibility is closely circumscribed.
Thank you, MrÂ Blokland.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
That is what we are doing now.
It was of immense significance internationally.
Freedom returned in 1975.
We all know that spirit.
Franco lost.
Nothing better could happen to Europe!
Â Â  .
We are now in 2006.
Thank you very much.
Sometimes, pacifism paves the way for horror.
Sometimes, it is a sign of courage.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  MrÂ President, âThey must be stopped!â
They are almost all dead.
We have named a prize after him.
We have never had difficulty finding candidates.
âEl pueblo unido jamÃ¡s serÃ¡ vencidoâ.
Almost 7Â 000 priests were murdered.
We lack such statesmen today.
This has to change!
We defend our ideals with our own convictions.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
We were also successful in getting civil society involved.
At the same time, we strengthened urban policy.
Does this mean that we are absolutely satisfied?
To be honest, it does not.
Today we are moving from theory to practice.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This initiative encourages border-region, transnational and interregional cooperation.
The new regulation will introduce a new legal precedent.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Much remains to be done.
Â Â  .
Firstly, we naturally need a strategic approach.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That means it presents us with an enormous challenge.
We need well-qualified people.
Enough people have tried.
I expect the Commission to monitor that.
He can count on our support.
Â Â  .
This is no exaggeration.
The European Union now needs real internal solidarity.
Not one euro should be wasted.
Not a single opportunity should be missed.
What we have before us is a sensible compromise.
Private resources could become part of cofinancing.
Are they large or small?
I am looking very much to the Commission there.
MrsÂ deÂ BrÃºn began by speaking Irish.
Irish is now an official language.
Each of them requires specific initiatives.
That is sufficient reason to support this policy fully.
We have succeeded in obtaining many improvements.
It is a gift that is no gift.
Improve our standard of living for pity's sake!
At last!
This must not be underestimated, as often happens.
These benefits are now available to all Member States.
I support all efforts to ensure total transparency.
I myself will try to help answer this.
I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs.
We have every reason to celebrate this agreement.
The public and the partners in regional policy ...
The new programming period is difficult.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We very much count on you.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
I wholeheartedly support this initiative.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The words should be on your voting lists.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Smugglers now earn similar amounts to drug dealers.
Â Â  .
Trafficking in human beings has reached alarming proportions.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
No.
Who decided it was âdesirableâ?
Â Â  .
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  I voted for MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda's report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We therefore voted against.
Â Â  .
In other words:
This is unacceptable.
Â Â  .
This is tantamount to blackmail, which is unacceptable.
Â Â  .
However, recently this has not occurred.
Â Â  .
Unfortunately these amendments were defeated.
And for what?
Little wonder the tide of Euro-scepticism continues to rise.
That would not be a more equitable system.
What is it playing at?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The basic problem remains intact, however.
Taxpayers have been warned.
An additional tax?
Surely not.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
We therefore voted against Paragraph 3 and Recital F.
Merely increasing taxes will not by itself reduce emissions.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Yes, aviation is a factor in climate change.
There is no quick technical solution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The current situation is worrying.
Let me be clear.
Â Â  .
This would undermine the current ETS.
Â Â  .
When will my job be on the line?
When will it be my turn?
We must not close our eyes to that.
It is time we faced up to that question.
There will be consolidations.
There will only be a slight increase in demand.
Aid awards were authorised in 2002.
The next steps are contained in the Lisbon Strategy.
Without competitive economies there is no investment.
Without investment there is no employment or social justice.
That is good news.
But what happens then in Portugal?
Hedge funds buy up companies as assets nowadays.
That cannot be the economic future of Europe!
Â Â  .
We are not against change.
We are for change.
That is our task in Parliament.
First and foremost it is about strengthening the individual.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This process has serious social and economic consequences.
So who benefits?
Agricultural products only make up 15% of turnover.
One was about structural change.
I share the view that restructuring is not new.
In some cases, restructuring is badly handled.
So, what is the secret?
Well, there are a few key factors.
Firstly, then, the long-term approach.
Employees should be a part of the restructuring process.
That way, new jobs can be created.
Restructuring will be needed.
We can work on information and consultation.
This will be increasingly important.
The opinions expressed by this Parliament were very useful.
There is nothing new about this.
We are treating it as if it were new.
It is going to come from profits.
That is going on in the successful companies.
It is going to create another thousand jobs.
That is the reality of industrial life.
It has been there for a long time.
The issue is how we deal with it.
We have all been through them every day.
Let us not have another debate like this.
Let us think about a positive way forward.
Europe must demonstrate its European social model.
It still has many consequences for all that.
Surely that means they are competitive!
In such cases, European taxpayers are paying double.
That is surely bad economics!
Last year 9Â 000 jobs were lost in Germany.
This is why this debate is worthwhile.
Closing down factories cannot be normal.
More needs to be done.
That is precisely the aim of our policy.
The debate is closed.
And thirdly, funding.
If not, we will be left behind.
The clock is ticking here as well.
This also requires the readiness to accept change.
The first point concerns research.
Â Â  .
First of all, we lack financial resources.
It was cut almost by half.
National budgets are just as important as European budgets.
Instead, they are small, traditional businesses.
I will start with the darker aspects.
That is the wrong way to go about things.
Of course, there are standards too.
That is precisely where we now stand.
I would also like to emphasise three points.
It is not.
That is often where the knowledge is.
We have to create better conditions for innovation.
Why?
Why?
This way we will establish innovation-based competitiveness.
I shall refer to three issues.
Europe still produces the most outstanding intellectual giants.
These are growth, research and production.
All the speakers described the situation very well.
In order to develop, one must invest.
That includes investment in scientific research and innovation.
This must change!
Thank you!
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 a.m.
Â Â  .
This is a danger we will not countenance.
Â Â  .
That is the question.
Nokia is a good example.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate on this report is suspended.
We will take the following questions to the Commission.
Â Â  .
Is that something that the Commission could investigate?
Â Â  .
The question is quite clear.
Can I ask if you are serious?
They want to follow their team.
Will you look at this again?
Â Â  .
I shall answer the first question.
Am I serious?
Yes, I am quite serious.
How is the Commission addressing this onslaught?
Â Â  .
So far so good!
Â Â  .
Â Â  I should like to correct you, Madam President.
I welcome that initiative very much.
He spoke about possible membership of the European Union.
Has he any idea of the timescale?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The honourable Member raises a very critical question.
Minority rights are a critical condition.
When can a final result be expected?
Â Â  .
They need to get a foot in the door.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  .
Full structural unbundling is one option to consider.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We will happily take that up.
Â Â  .
He was injured recently.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There are masses of programmes for this purpose.
How does the Commission envisage the future agreement?
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
That is also highly important for Russia.
Â Â  .
Can we have confidence in their reliability?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for that information.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Frattini.
Â Â  .
These are concrete examples for the public.
Then please help us.
We are committed to this.
Â Â  .
These include disabled ex-prisoners.
You will remember its conclusions of spring 2006.
Freedom of association must therefore always be respected.
What is the consequence?
My question was included on the list.
The questions will be answered in writing.
I am sorry.
There is nothing intentional about this.
Has the Commission examined this matter?
What measures does it propose to take?
Like you, I am aware of the situation.
Â Â  .
We are dealing with a complicated subject.
That concludes Question Time.
I am against dirigisme and protectionist policies.
Member States cannot reorganise their economies in a day.
This is particularly true for the new Member States.
1.
2.
3.
4.
However, we must welcome the positive side.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
What is this all about?
That has something to do with legal certainty.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, I shall conclude.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is the first step.
Â Â  .
For goodness sake.
We need non-regression.
Â Â  .
We are making sure that the controls are enhanced.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
I look forward to the forthcoming debate.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We cannot agree to what the Greens have proposed.
We shall therefore vote against the Greensâ amendments.
Â Â  .
This right is fundamental and paramount.
This may lead to confusion.
Â Â  .
Ireland neither produces nuclear waste nor reprocesses it.
We are seen as passive bystanders.
No one looks for our consent.
I firmly believe that this document deserves our support.
Â Â  .
The Commission will issue strict criteria for deciding that.
That also applies to nuclear energy.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  .
The world around us will not wait.
In this we support the work of the Commission.
Cooperation between successive Presidencies is very important for continuity.
There is need for progress in all sectors.
The onus is on them.
We are talking about a demand-driven innovation policy.
This should not be forgotten.
The role of the European Parliament has been crucial.
Energy policy choices are largely national affairs.
It needs to be taken seriously.
Coordination of civil and military crisis management will continue.
We live in a time of enormous challenges.
That time is here and now.
Â Â  .
We should be proud of our enlargement policy.
I welcome that debate.
I want that debate.
This will be a serious, rigorous exercise.
I welcome the fact that negotiations are under way.
The European economy is picking up pace.
We must implement better what already exists.
This is for us a question of principle.
I welcome this.
Who better to embody that truth than Finland?
Every link in this chain must be strong.
Â Â  .
Their absence is excusable.
Â Â  .
First, the market-driven programme.
I wish you the wisdom of VÃ¤inÃ¤mÃ¶inen.
You have not said anything about that.
I would therefore advise caution.
That is the reality of Europe.
You have not given Europe a direction.
That is what your speech was lacking.
Â Â  .
That policy is now being continued.
This Constitution will never come into force anywhere.
Finlandâs acceptance is a sign of subservience.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Do not make me laugh!
I will not be holding my breath.
Finland is thoroughly prepared to succeed in its Presidency.
Prime Minister, security is not created through isolation.
Our citizens also expect that.
The development, however, has become tangled.
That time is here and now.
Is this such an impossible equation to balance?
The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement needs to be reformed.
Now the Northern breeze is very welcome.
Its coolness is invigorating.
The Prime Minister said that transparency is essential.
You barely acknowledged the importance of climate change.
This is very discouraging indeed.
You did not say anything about this.
Why not?
Where is your leaderâs approach?
Today you spoke about developing internet search services.
What, then, is your policy on transparency?
Twenty of the 25 governments have also signed up.
Promises ought to be kept.
There is no room for complacency.
Let me turn, thirdly, to Russia.
There are many worrying signs.
Work well, and with zeal!
I welcome your stated commitment to transparency and subsidiarity.
That is not all, though.
I am also concerned about your lack of decisiveness.
Your speech was lacking in spirit.
Our citizens expect Europe to make them secure.
We need to deliver on better security cooperation.
Let us follow through on that logic.
There is good cause for this.
Research, product development and training are crucial.
We must not allow this.
I am reassured by your energy in that direction.
We have to be clear on the Russia issue.
Â Â  â I shall not be going on the attack.
We agree.
In other words, more and better Europe.
It is a shining example of modernisation and progress.
Finland has special responsibilities on this issue, too.
I wish the Presidency every success!
There are other instruments for promoting flexibility.
We speak Latin in Europe.
The President will have our support.
Our greatest weakness as Europeans is lack of innovation.
We wish Prime Minister Vanhanen success.
I should very much like to see this.
That is the best thing we could achieve.
That is why this Constitutional Treaty is so important.
Both legislators will nevertheless have to make progress.
I wish you good luck.
The criminals have too much of a head start.
Firstly, I will speak about the Presidency.
The Presidency needs three things to succeed.
First it must be well prepared.
The Finns have once again prepared themselves admirably.
Secondly, it must be objective.
The other point relates to transparency.
There is an interesting correlation.
Those two things can go hand in hand.
Good luck to the Presidency.
Â Â  .
This might be a better solution than strident rhetoric.
I cannot now comment on all your speeches.
That will also hopefully describe the Finnish Presidency.
This chain is necessary.
You sit in the European Parliament for five years.
The Commission sits for five years.
We have to devote our energies to that.
We also need legal immigration for Europe to succeed.
It is not.
That question is raised very frequently.
MrÂ PflÃ¼ger described Finland as neutral.
Hopefully we will achieve a result there.
We need to show solidarity within the Union.
These are issues which we all have in common.
Â Â  .
That, indeed, is the Commission's position.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
How are we to come through the present crisis?
Weapons and unilateral action will not bring peace.
Â Â  .
I now repeat that call.
All sides need to consider their responsibility extremely carefully.
But responsible politicians cannot give in to frustration.
I look forward to your continued support on that.
Let us be clear.
We have had to seek new ways.
This whole situation is a vicious circle.
Decisions are urgently needed in this matter.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
You have our full support in this.
Â Â  .
Let us have some consistency.
He who sows despair, reaps violence.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We cannot sit idly by and watch.
There are extremists on both sides.
They are above all entirely illegitimate.
It is not legitimate to penetrate Syrian airspace.
Stop this carnage, you have gone mad!
I put that question to the Council.
We have heard a lot less about Maria Aman.
What more does Israel want?
It has no intention of negotiating a two-state solution.
But where is the challenge from Europe?
Well how, precisely?
This is the main point.
Instead, there has been widespread corruption.
Nevertheless, Israel has no intention of reoccupying Gaza.
There were other ways to apply pressure.
Has it finally decided to condemn the attacks?
Many players have continued to cooperate with Palestine.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is a vicious circle.
He must be released unharmed.
That raises questions about respect for international law.
Is it really in Israelâs long-term interest?
All sides must exercise restraint.
How different the situation looks today.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The cause of the tragedy is the Israeli occupation.
We demand their immediate and unconditional release.
Â Â  The situation in Palestine is critical.
Â Â  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.
Are we all ready to vote?
More or lessÂ â¦
Â Â  Thank you, Sir Robert.
I did check.
That is what prolonged it.
All the best to you, Terry.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  Mr President, I would confirm that linguistic difficulty.
Â Â  .
Thank you for your remarks.
Therefore that was in order.
Â Â  .
This is a justified, welcome report.
Before events: annual planning of expected needs.
Â Â  .
Our parliamentary group therefore voted against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Greek Communist Party voted against the report.
Â Â  .
The benefits of ending this derogation are unclear.
Â Â  .
These amendments were as follows:
We deeply regret this.
Â Â  .
I vote in favour of compromise Amendment 1.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  .
Secondly, Europe is not sharing its knowledge.
Lastly, Europe is not financing knowledge.
Â Â  .
Secondly, Europe is failing to share its knowledge.
Thirdly, Europe is failing to finance knowledge.
Â Â  .
Words must now be transformed into action.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This report contains a number of contradictions.
Hence our decision to abstain.
Â Â  .
We tabled the declaration together.
Â Â  .
That will be very important during our Presidency.
Â Â  .
Thank you.
There is no trace of this in the report.
Â Â  .
Let me begin with a general observation.
Many of them have since disappeared.
I think that we need further clarification.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Why support a committee that is toothless?
There are no rational grounds for doing so.
It is fundamentally a division between socialists and conservatives.
We look to the European capitals.
That is the approach our work has been taking.
That is our conclusion.
What, though, did our governments do?
They did nothing.
I should like to quote her comments to you.
His report is entirely speculative and circumstantial.
It seeks to present unsubstantiated allegations as fact.
The US has taken a lead in this war.
I agree with MrÂ Piotrowski.
I have been pleasantly surprised, however.
The committee needs more time.
This is a question that we need to ask.
The existing legal means are draconian enough.
The report cannot be separated from the political context.
Â Â  Mr President, this is an astonishing report.
Illegal renditions by US agents have taken place.
This inquiry must therefore continue.
We abducted people illegally.â
It is unfounded to make allegations like that.
Â Â  Mr President, torture is always wrong and counterproductive.
Now it is being promoted by democratic states.
The latter is not necessarily a bad conclusion.
Thirdly, whom do you want to punish?
The world is flat.
If that is true it is very dangerous.
Secrecy should not mean illegality.
This is morally and legally monstrous.
I joined the inquiry with great interest and enthusiasm.
We condemn the practices of the CIA.
People opposite have talked about circumstantial evidence.
Why should we continue?
Why else do we need to extend the time?
I include the US in that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It is therefore urgent to pass this regulation.
Â Â  .
The European Central Bank is a European institution.
I should also like to say one last thing.
When will the blood samples start to be taken?
Emphatically, enough is enough.
It is certainly not the enemy of ordinary people.
I await the results of this inquiry with interest.
All loopholes in legislation must be plugged.
This really is becoming a matter of urgency.
There are two problems here.
- secondly, which European legislation will apply and
The pillars cannot apply here.
There are no pillars.
It is one thing.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is the structural difference.
The debate is closed.
The following questions have been submitted to the Council.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The interpretation into German was very comprehensible too.
There is something else I would like to ask.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Communication was adopted in September 2005.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
How does Finland view these initiatives?
Â Â  .
Now the technical work is being done.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There are a lot of these this week.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Somehow it must be improved.
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
This is a matter of our own self-interest.
We are well acquainted with its problems.
Visas are issued in capital cities.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It does not stop only people from getting about.
Not even the fee is to be reduced.
Â Â  .
This is a very important issue for us.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
I will limit my introductory remarks to these points.
Â Â  .
Only an expert could study it and understand it.
Over the years we have obtained small concessions.
That is why this agreement is so important.
That is also important.
There has also been this issue of sunset clauses.
We therefore do not need to use sunset clauses.
That is another reason for welcoming this agreement.
We have a ceasefire.
Certainly my thanks are due to the Commission.
Â Â  .
The agreement must prove its worth in practice.
My second question concerns sunset clauses.
Â Â  .
The present package has three consequences for Parliament.
Â Â  .
It is welcome and I am glad about it.
Now this case is being rectified in two ways.
I am glad about that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
My second point relates to the political dimension.
This will be the aim of this new tool.
This commitment comprises rights and obligations for both parties.
Integration initiatives are indeed implanted locally.
They must become full members of our societies.
Thank you once again.
That is the first thing we have to consider.
To date we have had minimal resources.
We must integrate immigrants into our societies.
Â Â  .
What are the shared guidelines for European immigration policy?
So what should we do?
So what is the obstacle?
The fourth theme is integration.
The fifth theme is illegal immigration.
These actions, too, are absolutely vital.
Â Â  .
I hope we see evidence of that.
It is positive for a series of reasons.
Â Â  .
There have also been cases like this in Lithuania.
Â Â  .
There is one tragedy after another.
It responds late and ineffectually.
Â Â  .
That is why people-traffickers must be tackled.
I have two questions for Commissioner Frattini.
The two proposals before us are important and useful.
This is a great benefit to Europe.
What should we be working towards?
Once we saw Vietnamese boat people fleeing oppressive regimes.
Third World countries do not need a handout.
Above all, they need to trade.
They are doing a marvellous job.
The time has come to demand more from immigrants.
Let us look at some of the aspects identified.
What happens, however?
That is the real shame.
That is the real truth.
FRONTEX is not the solution.
FRONTEX is a new-born baby.
Immigration is a social reality, pure and simple.
It says everything about us.
Immigration is not a police matter.
I have three points to make in this debate.
This is the seriousness of the situation.
What is it waiting for before making a move?
Let us avoid this problem.
This is the moment of truth.
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
All feel abandoned by the European Union.
But we have been left to our fate.
Is Europe inhospitable?
Â Â  Stavros Lambrinidisâ report is necessary and timely.
Today it costs USD 200.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  .
Lastly, we need to see investment in research.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This, for me, is a major concern.
It will therefore be necessary to continue our efforts.
This is something I consider important to remember.
That would be my cause for concern.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00.
Â Â  .
It is also easy to identify the migration poles.
This is what is known as co-development.
Â Â  .
That communication also contains extremely precise and specific guidelines.
This point is made very clear in your report.
Â Â  .
Now they are French.
This is a perfect example of integration.
Congratulations.
Â Â  .
Poverty is an overwhelming driving force.
Half of these are women.
This is three times the development aid offered worldwide.
Â Â  .
Migration policy is not just an EU matter.
Â Â  .
Subsidiarity is therefore much too important in this field.
Currently, we face the problem of Malta.
The immigrants have indeed adapted.
Development cooperation is a priority on its agenda.
Let us guarantee respect for the rights of migrants.
I will mention two of them.
What is the upshot of this?
Immigrants without papers?
No.
Temporary authorisations for seeking work?
Yes.
This is where the principle of citizenship takes us.
Â Â  Mr President, MrsÂ Carlotti, Commissioner.
This amounts to half a euro per immigrant.
The opposite is more likely to be the case.
I am talking about the brain drain.
Â Â  .
The development budget should not be funding these measures.
This is something I consider important.
I know that in this area you have none.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
The report was adopted unanimously in committee.
We had highly constructive exchanges.
These are two predilections we both share.
The European Union needs a well-coordinated fair trade policy.
We need this recommendation, Commissioner Mandelson.
Â Â  .
It is undoubtedly a very popular trade practice.
It is also a stimulus to the brain.
The Commission actively supports Fair Trade.
We also participate in Fair Trade events.
An individual makes a personal choice.
He or she is entitled to exercise that choice.
That should be our test.
The bigger this market, the greater the uncertainty.
Â Â  .
The report concerns the Fair Trade sector.
Â Â  .
I asked him whether he liked living in France.
I was in Ghana last year.
We cannot have Fair Trade on the cheap.
Fair Trade is about price and sustainability.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I agree with the Commissioner.
That represents an increase of 37% over 2004.
It is a very fine report.
Fair Trade is a success story.
We also need to combat social and ecological dumping.
These pesticides are a serious threat to development.
Â Â  .
That is obvious.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It is much appreciated by the Commission.
Â Â  I ask that Members lower the noise level.
I can tell you that we are now adjourning.
Â Â  â The next item is Voting Time.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
However, a good instrument requires an appropriate budget.
The budget framework is very ungenerous towards candidate states.
Please adopt this instrument.
Â Â  .
There was a linguistic mistake in the original version.
Â Â  .
Thus, in AmendmentÂ 15, after:
there must be added:
Â Â  â That concludes Voting Time.
Â Â  .
Parliament is completely out of the loop.
Parliament should not give anyone carte blanche.
I therefore voted against the proposal before us.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
A fundamental debate must be held first.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We voted against for the following reasons:
Â Â  .
Secondly, the report is full of contradictions.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Why duplicate this task?
Â Â  .
I utterly repudiate this approach.
Â Â  .
The interim report is important for two reasons.
They are mocking the world.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
They were the ones who signed these agreements.
Wake up, MrÂ Lambrinidis.
Do not forget why Theo Van Gogh is dead.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Integration is a two-way process.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Do you know if he is coming?
I believe that there are still margins for agreement.
The Doha round must not founder.
It is accompanied by major ambitions and expectations.
Our message must be crystal clear.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Mandelson here today.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
My third question is the most urgent.
Apparently she was unable to answer that.
I wonder whether the US has a mandate.
Where do we go?
What is the situation?
On a minor point, Mrs Harkin mentioned agriculture.
What is the position?
There have been no noticeable gains for least-developed nations.
There have also been major losses for Irish agriculture.
I have one or two questions.
You mentioned a new set of proposals in September.
Can you give us some details about that?
Now we come to the issue of globalisation.
That is an enormous opportunity for European producers.
Â Â  .
I shall make one observation immediately.
We will do what is fair.
We will do what is reasonable.
That is clear to me.
It should also be clear to our Member States.
There is nothing altruistic about this.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
This is also a question of justice.
Â Â  , .
So let me now come to our proposal.
That might help considerably.
Origin marking would be of considerable help there.
This, right away, enhances their rights considerably.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Mandatory origin marking is an example of this.
Â Â  .
It permits informed consumer decisions.
Why not?
However, that is not the point.
I would certainly be very resistant to that.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It presents us with a fundamental dilemma.
Military engagement is not our way.
So what can we do?
Â Â  .
Things in Somalia have now rearranged themselves.
Â Â  .
That kind of language is inflammatory and dangerous.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Sheikh Aweys is suspected of working with Al-Qaeda.
Â Â  .
We remain unequivocally committed to supporting the peace process.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
It certainly is not!
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have already heard what the key issues are.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The opening meeting was cordial and constructive.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This content is filtered using keywords.
Â Â  .
However, not everyone likes such an open medium.
This situation is unacceptable.
Freedom of speech is an inalienable right.
Â Â  .
Let us take Belarus as an example.
These are the facts.
Â Â  .
Europe should play a central role in this process.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Freedom of expression is an important issue.
Freedom carries with it a responsibility.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
âevenâ.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Unfortunately, that did not happen.
They want to get to Europe.
What is happening there therefore affects all of us.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Â Â  Does anybody wish to speak in favour?
We recognise Moldova within its borders.
We have heard that before.
Â Â  We shall do so again.
Take the Swedish nuclear power station, Forsmark.
He calls the situation the most dangerous since Chernobyl.
The matter is incredibly important.
We are dealing with a blatant case of slavery.
That is why we gave the game away.
We have the same problem daily in the Aegean.
It is an unbelievable figure.
Remember the tsunami?
But you will not face up to Iran!
Some summer recess!
That is totally unacceptable.
This should not be the case.
However, they fail to do so.
Dozens of people are indeed thought to have disappeared.
It is likely that they have died.
If so, then let it be the last.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am rather confused.
Â Â  We shall pass your question on to the Commission.
We need:
- firstly, compensation for the victims.
- thirdly, we need prevention for the future.
The power behind all this is absolutely irresponsible.
The European Parliament must adopt a conceptual resolution.
Unfortunately, their fears have come true.
Europe's values do not allow nationalism.
Why is all this happening?
Our fears have been realised.
This opened the floodgates and intimidation has gained credibility.
What lesson can we learn from this situation?
That would be the truly democratic choice.
It is time to give up that silly myth.
However, there is also internal illiteracy.
I knew him as Director-General for Transport and Energy.
His door was always open.
The one we get will not be the same.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  .
Tax measures can be very effective in this.
I wish him good luck.
The draft report she produced was a good one.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Taxation on vehicles in Member States varies widely.
Â Â  .
My group has rejected a ban on registration tax.
Â Â  .
That definitely cannot be sensible.
As I say, new cars are also safer.
If people own cars, they will drive them.
We hope to see a better proposal.
New technology is good for the environment.
This also means more rapid modernisation.
Â Â  Madam President, the Commission proposal has two objectives.
And taxes do provide a strong incentive for consumers.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I apologise for being late.
I flew out from Heathrow this morning.
That is simply unacceptable.
That was what I had to say.
Â Â  .
So what would such a notion mean?
Is that harmonisation, or is it not?
The new tax is, by definition, unfair.
That is what we need.
Â Â  â Let us face reality.
That is the problem.
Can this proposal still be improved upon?
It is not easy but we can do it.
It is a huge issue.
It is one correct way forward.
Therefore a safe car should pay less tax.
But that is another viewpoint.
I should like to mention the situation in Greece.
We have the most expensive cars in Europe.
We need justice at long last.
We need a uniform standard.
This tax has made cars unnecessarily expensive in Ireland.
Â Â  Mr President, let us not kid ourselves.
In that I agree wholly with Mrs Doyle.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you for your proposal.
Naturally, we support it.
This is a crime against humanity.
The best cure is prevention.
Fortunately, the EU can take a bigger view.
I believe we can go further.
Â Â  .
We must be quite clear on that point.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Many crises and natural disasters cannot be averted.
However, we can be better prepared.
Â Â  .
Other factors are at play here.
We are also asking for two other things.
One relates to Forest Focus.
That is absurd.
I am talking, of course, about prevention.
Biomass needs to be promoted.
Â Â  .
During that debate, important issues were raised.
This disaster also affected my constituency of Lower Silesia.
We need to consider all of these things.
Why?
Who is behind this natural disaster?
We must learn from our mistakes.
However, there are many things that disgust me.
That shows real urgency.
That aid must be as unbureaucratic as possible.
However, that is not enough.
The result has been a disaster.
Unquestionably Galiciaâs worst environmental disaster.
Commissioner, what has failed this year in Galicia?
Do you know?
Could that cooperation have been improved?
This year has sadly been no exception.
The Galicians are a Europeanist people.
Â Â  .
Otherwise, we cannot deliver more!
Let us look towards the future.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
It will help to stabilise the country.
That is what the people of Congo aspire to.
Â Â  .
I do not regard that as a good sign.
This is a tragic world record.
It consists of 17Â 500 young people.
I have been taking part in elections since 1979.
I have never seen an election like it.
They are desperate for peace, and deserve better.
Â Â  .
I therefore find your tunnel vision particularly excessive.
Which Belgian economic interests?
I therefore ask the question: which economic interests?
It needs such investment.
Why?
That is true, MrÂ PflÃ¼ger.
I have taken my sense of neutrality even further.
I have systematically sought contact with MrÂ Tshisekedi.
Personally, I can do nothing.
This chapter is now closed.
Perhaps I am a little old-fashioned in this respect.
You cannot just say anything.
The same applies to the police.
Substantial progress has, moreover, already been achieved.
I think we must talk about this.
This is my personal conviction.
The Congo has everything.
This is the real debate.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Nobody could describe this as âDoha-lightâ.
This sounds good, and is to be welcomed.
That deal will be hard to reach.
It is they who are losing new trade opportunities.
Nothing can replace the WTO.
We are looking at several negotiations in this context.
That remains my priority.
These costs arise, :
The European Union maintained a constructive and responsible position.
Europe must continue to promote the multilateral system.
Â Â  .
All pro-development commitments must be delivered upon.
Qualified access is what is needed.
What was it meant to develop?
That is the core issue.
I have always said that I do not.
We want trade.
Â Â  .
It is time to remember that.
Let us make no mistake about that.
This is not surprising.
This is a fallacy.
It is time to move on.
Â Â  .
It is time to set that blame aside.
We must not move backwards.
What will happen to the negotiations on cotton?
Why do we not draw particular conclusions from this?
It really is worth trying to do that.
My second comment relates to farming.
Multilateral agreement is essential.
We wish you well in that task.
I think not.
Lastly, what about CAP reforms?
That will take time.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Kamall.
We need to and must do the same.
Â Â  .
Well, we in Europe conceived the Doha Round.
I will be working to that end.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
We know that Parliament also values it very highly.
During that period its success has been widely acknowledged.
I am looking forward to todayâs debate.
Today sees us sending out two very clear messages.
Â Â  .
She is one of the pioneers.
Â Â  .
We cannot therefore feel satisfied, naturally.
All of them require urgent action and resources.
I am proud of this achievement.
This and only this will be fruitful.
Almost everyone is silent on this matter.
I wonder whyÂ â¦
Is being imprudent, however, a crime?
Those countries with which we have agreements need support.
There is much to do in this field.
We also need to review the scale of punishments.
There is room for thought on this matter.
We must therefore take measures.
Penalties must suddenly get stricter.
This is a crime.
We need to fight drugs effectively.
It may seem unnecessary to discuss this issue again.
However, nothing could be further from the truth.
They worked fifteen hours a day.
After all, the matter affected thousands of people.
These events took place a few weeks ago.
The same applies to you as to MrsÂ Kauppi.
I cannot help that.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
You can rely on our cooperation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  .
This course of affairs is not unique, unfortunately.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
Â Â  .
International crime is a great concern to us all.
There is a link between development and trade.
Questions of human rights are a delicate issue.
Allow me to wax nostalgic for a moment.
Things turned out otherwise, however.
The Middle East is our neighbour.
We need to try and identify common interests.
Varying political views are a natural part of Europe.
A multiform Union needs multidimensional parliamentarism.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  We will now continue with voting time.
Â Â  That will be reviewed.
It may well be the case.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The main items for me are important.
Â Â  We have chosen to abstain.
This discriminatory situation must stop.
Â Â  .
This is discrimination.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This has to change once and for all.
The sums in question are not inconsiderable.
I have thus voted against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Pollution caused by ships is extremely concerning.
We cannot allow ship-to-ship oil transfers to go ahead.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The June List has thus voted against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Violence against women is a terrible blight.
Children are also affected.
Â Â  .
Human dignity must come first.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I want to record the following in explanation.
Â Â  .
This is not strictly true.
Ireland gains EUR 1.15 billion from VRT.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We must also stop the paralysis of our governments.
Taxation cannot be the only solution.
We must also develop regulations to reduce greenhouse gases.
The Greens want registration tax to be maintained.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
The same is also true for administration.
Secondly, we adopted a comprehensive approach.
Hopefully, we will achieve consensus through cooperation.
The EU institutions are no different from other organisations.
Â Â  .
The second specific issue is the question of priorities.
Â Â  .
This is a budget for 27 Member States.
Â Â  .
I am not going to repeat our position.
We support this.
We think it is realistic and grounded.
That means somebody here is not telling the truth.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
This report deals essentially with values.
Â Â  .
All these aims support one another reciprocally.
Europe cannot be competitive without being socially strong.
It cannot be competitive without a social policy.
I am extremely grateful to them for this.
The report they have produced is a good one.
These are the common distinguishing characteristics.
We therefore have to create sustainable pension systems.
Â Â  .
Far from it, in fact.
What is needed is a change in these policies.
Â Â  .
That is why this flexibility must be there.
Therefore, this report is irrelevant!
The social model is profoundly discriminatory.
That is of vital importance.
Moreover, sometimes they are correct.
Today the Latvian state does not have enough resources.
These are the facts.
We are pulling the wool over people's eyes.
We shall be unable to keep our word.
We therefore need to look facts in the face.
Technology should show us the way.
Now it is one machine with one operator.
Jobs are being lost to technology.
As for this report, it is generally ok.
What about the creeping abandonment of the welfare state?
I should like to thank both rapporteurs.
Something has to be done.
We must help to do it.
Our constituents want reform.
I am really pleased with that.
Mr Crowley welcomed the report.
What should its features be?
The same is true of the European social model.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Actual emissions were lower than many expected.
The scheme infrastructure is operating smoothly.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Please take that as a given.
We need to look at this situation urgently.
What has happened?
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
What do they do?
The German and Polish allocation plans are scandalous.
They destroy the whole system of incentives.
Consequently, pollution must be made expensive.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
So it cannot be a cover-up.
Some companies have done that.
The debate is closed.
We will take the following questions to the Commission.
Â Â  .
I will be reporting to the ministers.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Can you also supply figures for this?
Â Â  .
If not, why not?
If not, why not?
Â Â  .
Therefore there is a gap there in the legislation.
We have two approaches.
I think the message is quite strong.
Â Â  .
Definitely, I agree.
We also know that it causes heart problems.
Â Â  .
I am afraid not.
I conducted a small poll myself.
It is the Member States that decide on that.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Various steps have been taken to this end.
Â Â  .
An integrated European industrial policy is to be welcomed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That is what this Commission stands for.
We have brought about a real paradigm shift.
They need an environment in which they can develop.
Thirdly, the simplification programme is in full swing.
The exact opposite is true.
Â Â  Question 45 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  The Birds Directive generally bans spring hunting.
Â Â  .
What more can we do?
Has it been?
If not, when do you expect this report?
Â Â  .
This decision was made on human health grounds.
This expert opinion is expected in October 2006.
Â Â  Thank you for that reply, Commissioner.
Â Â  .
We do not know.
The United States has a different approach to this.
Â Â  .
They are imported and introduced without any veterinary controls.
Â Â  .
That ban is a temporary one.
Is that an acceptable way to continue?
Â Â  .
Â Â  I think that the answer is very straightforward.
Â Â  .
I shall be as brief as possible.
That is the main problem.
The project was split into 19 subprojects.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Where there is a will there is a way.
We expect a constructive spirit from all parties.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Thank you for your question, Mr Evans.
That concludes Question Time.
Here are a few figures.
What are we talking about?
I quote the WHOâs definition.
What is being done?
Little or nothing!
We have an efficient health system.
Our health professions are monitored.
The world is, in fact, unprotected.
Borders are extremely porous.
Let us make no mistake.
That is also the burden of written declaration no.
We have a wide range of partners.
This is sordid reality.
There should be no let-up in fighting this war.
The question rightly mentions three problem areas.
EURÂ 2.3Â million have been provided for this.
Â Â  .
More could be done perhaps in that area.
Â Â  .
MrÂ Cornillet quoted a whole range of revealing figures.
At best, these counterfeit medicines are ineffective.
So much for the observations that can be made.
Â Â  .
That is indeed the priority.
Indeed, health is not just about medicines.
Another example relates to AIDS.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
The Green Paper pursued three objectives.
We held a full consultation.
We had more than 150 contributions.
That is extremely important.
I look forward to the debate.
Once again, I thank Parliament for this initiative.
The public has not always liked that.
Stigma is rampant in all our countries.
It is a human rights abuse.
We have legislated against discrimination for people with disabilities.
My report is about these things.
That makes public belief possible.
Â Â  .
Getting it right is so important.
Hopefully, though, we are making headway.
I fear that this subject in reality affects everyone.
Whoever we are, mental health affects us.
This oppressive silence ought no longer to exist nowadays.
We must take this phenomenon into account.
It is impossible to live without purpose.'
The increase in the number of suicides is catastrophic.
We obviously cannot disregard the current situation.
It is not only treatment that matters.
Â Â  .
The constant stress may lead to mental problems.
I do not agree with this point of view.
Thank you, John.
I would fully agree with you.
In fact, I would seriously question our data.
Ten times that number attempt suicide.
Mental ill health is preventable and treatable.
He has written an excellent report.
Take drug addiction.
What is the best way of overcoming addiction?
That is when European cooperation comes into its own.
A malfunctioning heart will give rise to cardiac disease.
Only somatic illnesses are tolerated.
I have just one more thing to say.
Why is society so ill?
What are the causes?
The statistics reflect the cruel truth.
But at what price?
MrÂ Bowis detailed that very well in his report.
Patients still have no say.
Patient organisations followed suit.
I wish the Commissioner every success in this.
The path to maturity is stonier than ever.
Growth seems hampered by societyâs increased uncertainty.
Depression has been called the new European disease.
I should like to give just a few statistics.
The focus here is on prevention.
To close, allow me to mention war victims.
Â Â  .
I shall be brief.
Teaching parenting skills is also important.
Gender aspects will be taken into account.
They will all take gender into account.
Ageing is a reality and a fact.
We have an ageing population.
The point is to make ageing healthy.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Mental illness also belongs to this list, though.
The EU only has a secondary role in this.
That is why this project must continue.
Â Â  .
It seems to be a happy coincidence.
However, it would appear that I lacked imagination.
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This covers a number of issues.
What are these values?
Do they cover human rights?
The rights of minorities?
Is an independent Kosovo needed to live like this?
Yes or no?
I doubt this is a realistic prospect.
This has only been the case in part.
Which party can limit this sovereignty?
Now to my final point.
There are four different representations in Kosovo.
All this in the small region that is Kosovo.
The tasks facing us are much more extensive.
We must endeavour to create capacities.
We must help build up the civil administration.
Would we do any better?
What role may European troops soon play in Kosovo?
This is the real problem.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Direct discussions and consultations with experts are continuing.
The European Union fully supports these objectives.
Preparations are under way in all three areas.
Kosovo itself should assume local ownership and take responsibility.
Â Â  .
It also has a cost.
I have a special plea for the Finnish Presidency.
I call on Parliament to correct this budgetary dead-end.
It is there in writing.
Two elements are therefore required.
Â Â  .
NATO is responsible for military security.
That is also obvious from talking to people.
That is a weighty responsibility for the European Union.
We can see clearly the contours of the solution.
This would simply further escalate the crisis.
This is of crucial importance for the entire region.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I would like to make three points.
We must stay firm on this.
It must formulate a common stand.
We are talking about applying standards.
We have offered the Western Balkans a European future.
That is what I want him to tell us.
Joachim RÃ¼cker has been put in charge of UNMIK.
A multiethnic community has not been established.
The objectives of this war are visible today.
Â Â  .
This is obvious, of course.
Â Â  .
We will not gain anything from prolonging the process.
Serbia has firm and tangible prospects of joining Europe.
That is not the case at all.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
- the Council statement on Albania and
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The SAA represents an important economic and political opportunity.
Â Â  .
I would sum up my report as follows.
Progress must be made in implementing the adopted reforms.
It calls for a visa facilitation agreement with Albania.
These deficiencies must be corrected.
The report says that electoral legislation must be reformed.
I have received six amendments.
Finally, respect for minorities.
Albania really does need to take important steps here.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is why we understand its difficulties.
Conditions in prisons are unsatisfactory.
Only those who realise their mistakes can remedy them.
Â Â  .
Its problems appear to be beyond any solution.
I find this a little strange.
They were not always in accord, Commissioner.
What is the story here?
What answer is there to that?
That is the percentage.
The time is not yet right.
Is that not the truth?
Is that not the truth?
Similarly, trafficking in children cannot be controlled.
We must therefore look very carefully before we leap.
Today I can say that Albania is changing.
Comparison with Macedonia is similarly favourable.
Albania is facing enormous problems.
The third problem is womenâs rights.
Many farms do not produce enough to be competitive.
Â Â  Office.
Â Â  .
Europe is the main market for seal products.
I thank all of you very much.
Â Â  â The next item is the vote.
We had a moral obligation from the Council.
Â Â  . â Mr President, that is acceptable.
Â Â  . â Mr President, that is also acceptable.
I ask that negotiations be commenced.
Â Â  â That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore believe that this report should be adopted.
Â Â  .
Accordingly I have voted against this report.
In this way, voters are being lied to.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The European social model is in need of reform.
The answer is: without fear.
It is not enough merely to talk among ourselves.
Â Â  .
The European social model is unique.
MrÂ Bowisâs fame has spread throughout Europe.
Â Â  .
It is time to react!
I have thus voted against this report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I welcome this debate.
Â Â  .
I shall be voting in favour of this proposal.
These objectives are commendable.
I have thus voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
There now remain only 5Â 500 fishing vessels.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Accordingly I have voted against this report.
Â Â  .
We need to break the deadlock.
Â Â  .
We cannot go on much longer like this.
I believe they are right.
What are we aiming for?
The primary competence must be political.
I was deeply moved by that.
Â Â  .
That would be a fatal error.
That is why dialogue between cultures is so important.
It has reduced much of Lebanon to rubble.
And of course we must go further.
We must speak with one voice.
We have long-term tasks too.
He has a mandate, but of what kind?
Somebody will have to take the political responsibility.
What is the European Union's role now?
That is the problem.
MrÂ Watson is right.
Some European Union Member States are sending troops.
I woke up one morning having dreamt something.
It wants an Islamic area!
I have had enough of these political groups!
Â Â  .
We are right to be pleased about this.
We must never forget it.
You rightly said so, MrÂ Tuomioja.
Euromarfor would give us the means to do this.
My respect and admiration goes out to Lebanon.
There are other priorities, too.
There can be no peace without that.
This is both an opportunity and a responsibility.
This is our responsibility.
We know what has to happen.
Hans-Dietrich Genscher will be delighted by this.
The difficulties in the Council have already been mentioned.
Yes, it is.
The European Union also bears serious responsibilities.
What did he expect?
How does the European Union react to this?
The words have been subverted.
The war was brewing.
We let it brew.
It was planned.
In this instance, the conflict has deep roots.
We earnestly desire an international peace conference.
We did do so.
Did our secret services not know this?
Nothing was done about this.
Europe must raise its voice.
We do not have them yet.
We do not have to reinvent the wheel.
The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is part of that process.
That is an achievement that we should stress.
That is the way to proceed.
Without it the region will remain a flashpoint.
Let us look forward.
Europe has something to contribute.
Our road map has several objectives.
He says, âGaza has been reoccupied.
The world must know this (...).
It is in its worst condition, ever.
I turn now to the war in Lebanon.
On this, are our hands clean?
A political solution needs to be found for them.
We must naturally help demilitarise and neutralise Hezbollah.
What has the Council done over all this time?
Moreover, will Hezbollah be disarmed as a result?
They are equipped via Damascus international airport.
We must fully control Damascus international airport.
We need clear rules of engagement.
What can we offer there?
It has also used inhumane cluster bombs.
Europe faces three connected challenges in this regard.
UNIFIL II must be successful.
There has also been enormous progress with economic renewal.
I agree with all that.
Enough said.
His name is Renan.
He is a DJ.
It must have taken months or even years.
Where were the international observers?
Now for the final matter, Commissioner.
Is there nothing we could have done earlier?
Everything is pointing to this threatening direction.
Israel is left alone in its desperate struggle.
It is time for Europe to wake up.
Europe needs a common foreign and defence policy.
Russia has to decide which side it stands on.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The debate is closed.
Reality confronts us with our political responsibilities.
Israelâs action was disproportionate.
The following questions have been submitted to the Council.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
At the conference an action plan was adopted.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
One of the criteria referred to is age.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This is purely related to the funding of it.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
At 7.45 p.m.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
This event is proof of the fact.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  Thank you for your response, President-in-Office.
Â Â  .
The other example concerns liquid explosives.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Question No 17 has been withdrawn.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
That concludes Question Time.
Please be patient, MrÂ Speroni.
Allow me, then, to do so.
That is all.
Â Â  .
I am therefore completely perplexed by her attitude.
That is rather revealing.
Â Â  .
We all know the key challenges.
What principles should guide us?
Â Â  .
We need to see continued improvement in human rights.
China has growing ambitions on the international stage.
The death penalty?
Respect for international law?
The demilitarisation of security?
Climate change?
That cannot be taken seriously.
Nothing more.
The rest is nothing but fine words.
Â Â  .
He brought China to its knees.
That would be bad for the Chinese people.
Forced sterilisation and forced abortions continue to be practiced.
Please allow me to make three further points.
This must be guaranteed.
There must also be cultural autonomy for Tibet.
Why?
This would be for our mutual benefit.
Where are we offering the Commission encouragement?
Those are the kinds of things that are missing.
That would make me very unhappy.
There are also different interests in play.
Moreover, China is not just any old country.
Let there be no mistake about that, Commissioner.
Firstly, there are issues relating to environmental protection.
Even today, China is its largest factory.
Utopian socialism continues to flourish there.
The EU must take a decisive stance on this.
The two must go hand-in-hand.
Secondly: Europol.
The reasons are as follows.
It should step up the following activities in particular:
Her commitment is evident.
You were talking about a developing country.
I have tabled an amendment to have this deleted.
Be fair in your ...
Even so, the rules must be observed.
So far China has offered no such evidence.
One example of positive cooperation is in foreign policy.
I think we should.
China also imports oil from Sudan.
We are not naÃ¯ve.
Yet I also support a language of truth.
I have a few comments.
The economic relations themselves need to be balanced.
That is a moral outrage.
Secondly, there is Tibet.
Thirdly, there is Taiwan.
We are in a win-win situation.
Â Â  .
Let me also say a word on Taiwan.
This is important.
That is the situation at present.
A further update will be available shortly.
I should like to close with two general statements.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
I have no difficulty in reverting to Parliament.
There is a host of confusing messages.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
We have an election in Sweden.
Such a situation is emphatically not sustainable ecologically.
Â Â  Mr President, the principle of eco-labelling is sound.
Nonetheless I congratulate the rapporteur on her thoughtful report.
I shall end on that happy note.
This will protect both fish stocks and consumers.
Woe betide if we ignore them.
Four issues are of particular importance in this case.
These programmes should be based on voluntary participation.
I fully support what he says.
I listened to the Commissioner with interest.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Nicholson.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
Â Â  .
Such is the nature of modern life.
This is something we should pursue.
Â Â  .
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
and
Â Â  .
The negotiations should start tomorrow in Brussels.
Â Â  .
That is the best way forward.
That is quite clear.
We must fight terrorism together.
That is not the way forward.
As regards the future negotiations.
Two stages are therefore required.
Â Â  .
We need strict and legally-binding purpose- and access-limitation provisions.
Therefore we need the third-pillar measure.
Has the Commission thought about this?
Can we trust the Commission on that?
This is the first paradox in the affair.
Â Â  .
Well, what a reference standard to have!
It is already an embarrassment.
It will be ignored by the Council.
With what jurisdiction was it held?
Who convened this meeting?
In other words, they are blackmailing us.
What does it mean?
Why is it necessary?
Why is it proportionate?
The European Parliament therefore needs information immediately.
But I also endorse our other criticisms.
Why is this?
Is it Mr Frattiniâs fault?
Is it due to the Council?
Why?
It is a mockery of the people.
She has said what had to be said.
Europe must speak with one voice.
We are talking about travel through US air space.
For this, the Council is in disgrace.
What do we need?
We also need stronger cooperation with the United States.
The European Union proudly insists on this principle.
I can supply some detailed information about this.
The other point is positive profiling.
Why are we considering such a system?
Think about frequent fliers.
â The joint debate is closed.
Â Â  .
They are concerns which the Commission fully shares.
Much remains to be done in this area.
They therefore contribute to regional development and regeneration.
Â Â  .
That is what frightens me.
That is our main goal now.
Today we are living in a rapidly-changing world.
Then came a period of rapid redevelopment.
Pearls are small and hidden.
Â Â  .
This proposal deserves to be carefully analysed.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Notwithstanding, they need immediate attention.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
â That concludes voting time.
Â Â  .
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  .
This is poor form.
Â Â  .
I do not support a one-China policy!
I am thus voting against this report.
Â Â  .
In which case labelling is not the issue.
Â Â  .
This is a bad start.
Â Â  .
What is to be done?
I therefore voted against this resolution.
The June List is therefore abstaining from voting.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Sometimes the only thing to talk about is peace.
We are aware of the risks, however.
Â Â  .
I endorse the compromise text on the Middle East.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I am thus voting against this resolution.
Â Â  .
We have just come back from our holidays.
Much more can and must be done.
This failure is incomprehensible.
This failure was incendiary.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Nothing could be further from the truth.
We therefore voted against.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
A world with freer trade is a freer world.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I had no problems in supporting this resolution.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Terrorism and organised crime being examples of this.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
I therefore wish to congratulate MrÂ Sifunakis.
Â Â  .
I am voting against the report as a whole.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Nevertheless, we still have to move forward.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
The Tamil-speaking population is very mixed.
Â Â  .
We should be realistic here.
There is, however, good news to report.
Â Â  .
This shows the seriousness of the situation.
Let me make something clear.
Â Â  .
This is in our power â it must be.
Â Â  .
The suffering inflicted on innocent civilians is intolerable.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  .
I refer to Cuba and North Korea.
They are not economic migrants.
Â Â  .
Understandably, people risk their lives to escape.
Â Â  .
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
These are the main problems facing the economy.
Perhaps this is not intended to be taken seriously?
I shall conclude with a question for the Commissioner.
Â Â  .
Unemployment afflicts 70% of the population.
It has not done so.
No wonder Mugabe takes none of this seriously.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
How do things stand?
What can we do?
The trade unions in Zimbabwe deserve our particular support.
Â Â  .
It shows the limits of our power.
Can we find other means?
It strikes me as a positive and useful idea.
Agriculture is collapsing and famine is becoming widespread.
What was said confirms our concerns.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
This is actually no more than an editorial amendment.
Â Â  Mr President, this is a technical amendment.
Â Â  â That concludes voting time.
That is something that should be looked at.
Â Â  .
There is another reason.
That event should be on all our minds.
I therefore oppose having the debate without a resolution.
Have the victims been compensated and long-term damage prevented?
Â Â  â I wish to speak on a similar matter.
Thirty-seven people were shot and injured by plastic bullets.
I personally witnessed that these statements were false.
Dear colleagues, that was a shame!
I hope we all agree on that.
It affects both parties in power and opposition parties.
This is a shame.
That is not the problem.
That is not the right path, either.
These signatures therefore constitute a protest.
Some of them are from outside Europe.
This document brought Parliament into disrepute.
It teaches us mutual love and respect.
Those words were reckless and not based on facts.
I refer of course to those who survived.
We must not be indifferent to their plight.
I was astounded.
Is that what Plan D is about?
Is that dialogue?
Maybe that is how the EU does its business.
It is called indentured labour.
Enough of this indentured labour!
It is a disgrace!
Members of this group have expressed alarming views.
That is scandalous.
Please accept my apologies.
I have taken good note of your request.
Â Â  Thank you.
We need to step up our efforts.
This will also address the problem of cross-border pollution.
Approval of these measures must not be delayed.
This cannot be accepted.
They replied that they did not.
I think I must stop here.
Let me briefly sketch out the essential points.
I will start with PM10.
Let me just say something about ArticleÂ 20.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrÂ Krahmer.
Â Â  .
Millions of people suffer from asthma and related disorders.
We demand, in fact, three political changes.
They are also a definite incentive for innovation.
Our second pillar is attention for implementation.
Only adequate efforts warrant exceptions.
The third pillar is an ambitious source policy.
Â Â  .
Â Â  .
Whatever the figure is, it is very large.
Â Â  .
